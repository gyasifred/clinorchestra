AIM: The “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation” provides 
recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.
METHODS : A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing 
studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, 
the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this 
guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also 
considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSTRUCTURE: Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the 
United States and globally. Recommendations from the “2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients 
With Atrial Fibrillation” and the “2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the 
Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new 
recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage 
occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have 
been developed.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationTOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES
 1. Stages of atrial fibrillation (AF): The previous clas-
sification of AF, which was based only on arrhyth-
mia duration, although useful, tended to emphasize 
therapeutic interventions. The new proposed clas-
sification, using stages, recognizes AF as a disease 
continuum that requires a variety of strategies at the 
different stages, from prevention, lifestyle and risk 
factor modification, screening, and therapy.
 2. AF risk factor modification and prevention: 
This guideline recognizes lifestyle and risk factor 
modification as a pillar of AF management to pre-
vent onset, progression, and adverse outcomes. 
The guideline emphasizes risk factor management 
throughout the disease continuum and offers more 
prescriptive recommendations, accordingly, includ-
ing management of obesity, weight loss, physical 
activity, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, 
hypertension, and other comorbidities.
 3. Flexibility in using clinical risk scores and expand-
ing beyond CHA2DS2-VASc for prediction of 
stroke and systemic embolism: Recommendations 
for anticoagulation are now made based on yearly 
thromboembolic event risk using a validated clini-
cal risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc. However, 
patients at an intermediate annual risk score who 
remain uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation 
can benefit from consideration of other risk variables 
to help inform the decision, or the use of other clini-
cal risk scores to improve prediction, facilitate shared 
decision making, and incorporate into the electronic 
medical record.
 4. Consideration of stroke risk modifiers: Patients 
with AF at intermediate to low (<2%) annual risk 
of ischemic stroke can benefit from consideration 
of factors that might modify their risk of stroke, 
such as the characteristics of their AF (eg, burden), 
nonmodifiable risk factors (sex), and other dynamic 
or modifiable factors (blood pressure control) that 
may inform shared decision-making discussions.
 5. Early rhythm control: With the emergence of new 
and consistent evidence, this guideline emphasizes 
the importance of early and continued management 
of patients with AF that should focus on maintaining 
sinus rhythm and minimizing AF burden.
 6. Catheter ablation of AF receives a Class 1 indi-
cation as first-line therapy in selected patients: 
Recent randomized studies have demonstrated 
the superiority of catheter ablation over drug ther-
apy for rhythm control in appropriately selected 
patients. In view of the most recent evidence, we 
upgraded the Class of Recommendation.
 7. Catheter ablation of AF in appropriate patients 
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
receives a Class 1 indication: Recent randomized studies have demonstrated the superiority of cath-
eter ablation over drug therapy for rhythm control 
in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection 
failure. In view of the data, we upgraded the Class 
of Recommendation for this population of patients.
 8. Recommendations have been updated for 
device-detected AF: In view of recent studies, 
more prescriptive recommendations are provided 
for patients with device-detected AF that consider 
the interaction between episode duration and the 
patient's underlying risk for thromboembolism. 
This includes considerations for patients with AF 
detected via implantable devices and wearables.
 9. Left atrial appendage occlusion devices receive 
higher level Class of Recommendation: In view 
of additional data on safety and efficacy of left 
atrial appendage occlusion devices, the Class of 
Recommendation has been upgraded to 2a com-
pared with the 2019 AF Focused Update for use 
of these devices in patients with long-term contra-
indications to anticoagulation.
 10. Recommendations are made for patients with 
AF identified during medical illness or surgery 
(precipitants): Emphasis is made on the risk of 
recurrent AF after AF is discovered during noncar-
diac illness or other precipitants, such as surgery.
PREAMBLE
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated 
scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with 
recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. 
These guidelines, which are based on systematic meth-
ods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a founda-
tion for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The 
ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication 
of clinical practice guidelines without commercial sup-
port, and members volunteer their time to the writing and 
review efforts. Guidelines are the official policy of the 
ACC and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA 
collaborate with other organizations.
Intended Use
Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations 
applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardio-
vascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the 
United States, but these guidelines are relevant to pa-
tients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be 
used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is 
to improve quality of care and align with patients’ inter-
ests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting 
the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances 
and should not replace clinical judgment.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationClinical Implementation
Management, in accordance with guideline recommenda-
tions, is effective only when followed by both practitioners 
and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be 
enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians 
and patients, with patient engagement in selecting inter-
ventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, 
and associated conditions and comorbidities.
Methodology and Modernization
The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, up-
dates, and modifies guideline methodology on the basis 
of published standards from organizations, including the 
Institute of Medicine,1,2 and on the basis of internal re-
evaluation. Similarly, presentation and delivery of guide-
lines are reevaluated and modified in response to evolving 
technologies and other factors to optimally facilitate dis-
semination of information to health care professionals at 
the point of care.
Numerous modifications to the guidelines have been 
implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user 
friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a 
modular, “knowledge chunk” format, in which each chunk 
includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, 
recommendation-specific supportive text and, when 
appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyper-
linked references are provided for each modular knowl-
edge chunk to facilitate quick access and review.
In recognition of the importance of cost–value con-
siderations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and 
feasible, an analysis of value for a drug, device, or inter-
vention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/
AHA methodology.3
To ensure that guideline recommendations remain cur-
rent, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
the writing committee and staff. Going forward, targeted 
sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically 
after publication and timely peer review of potentially 
practice-changing science. The previous designations of 
“full revision” and “focused update” will be phased out. 
For additional information and policies on guideline devel-
opment, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guideline 
methodology manual4 and other methodology articles.5–7
Selection of Writing Committee Members
The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guide-
line writing committee contains requisite content exper-
tise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular 
community by selection of experts across a spectrum of 
backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, 
sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, 
and clinical practice settings. Organizations and profes-sional societies with related interests and expertise are 
invited to participate as partners or collaborators.
Relationships With Industry and Other Entities
The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods 
to ensure that documents are developed without bias or 
improper influence. The complete policy on relationships 
with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online.  
Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee mem-
bers’ comprehensive and relevant RWI; for the purposes 
of full transparency, comprehensive and relevant disclo-
sure information for the Joint Committee is also available 
online.
Evidence Review and Evidence Review 
Committees
In developing recommendations, the writing committee 
uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all 
available data.4,5 Literature searches focus on randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonran-
domized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, 
cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. 
Only key references are cited.
An independent evidence review committee is com-
missioned when there are ≥ 1 questions deemed of 
utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic 
review to determine which patients are most likely to ben-
efit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what 
degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence review 
committee and formal systematic review include absence 
of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of 
defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent 
with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial 
number of patients, and likelihood that the findings can 
be translated into actionable recommendations. Evidence 
review committee members may include methodologists, 
epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians. Recom-
mendations developed by the writing committee on the 
basis of the systematic review are marked “SR”.
Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy
The term guideline-directed management and therapy 
(GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic 
testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treat-
ments. For these and all recommended drug treatment 
regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with prod-
uct insert material and evaluate for contraindications 
and interactions. Recommendations are limited to drugs, 
devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the 
United States.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review
The recommendations listed in this guideline are, 
whenever possible, evidence based. An initial exten-
sive evidence review, which included literature derived 
from research involving human subjects, published in 
English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), 
EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected 
databases relevant to this guideline, was conduct-
ed from May 2022 to November 2022. Key search 
words included but were not limited to the following: 
atrial fibrillation; pregnancy; heart defects, congeni-
tal; smoking; cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic; alcohol; 
caffeine; sleep; diet; fitness; obesity; anticoagulants; 
diabetes; rhythm monitoring; heart failure; genetics; 
heart valve diseases; rate control; catheter ablation; 
social determinants of health; chronic kidney disease; 
sinus rhythm; chronic coronary syndromes; left atrial 
appendage occlusion; left atrial appendage exclu-
sion; cardiac surgical procedures; amiodarone; elec-
trical cardioversion; thromboembolism; rhythm control; 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Additional relevant 
studies, published through November 2022 during the 
guideline writing process, were also considered by the 
writing committee and added to the evidence tables 
when appropriate. The final evidence tables are includ-
ed in the Online Data Supplement and summarize the 
evidence used by the writing committee to formulate 
recommendations. References selected and published 
in the present document are representative and not 
all-inclusive.
1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee
The writing committee consisted of cardiologists, car-
diac electrophysiologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and 
patient representatives/lay stakeholders. The writing 
committee included representatives from the ACC and 
AHA, ACCP, and HRS. Appendix 1 of the current docu-
ment lists writing committee members’ comprehensive 
and relevant RWI.
1.3. Document Review and Approval
The Joint Committee appointed a peer review commit-
tee to review the document. The peer review committee 
comprised individuals nominated by the ACC, AHA, and 
the collaborating organizations. Reviewers’ RWI informa-
tion was distributed to the writing committee and is pub-
lished in this document (Appendix 2).
This document was approved for publication by the 
governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and was 
endorsed by ACCP and HRS.1.4. Scope of the Guideline
In developing the “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guide-
line for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation” 
(2023 atrial fibrillation guideline), the writing committee re-
viewed previously published guidelines. Table 1 contains a 
list of these publications deemed pertinent to this writing 
effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating 
the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations.
1.5. Class of Recommendations and Level of 
Evidence
The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the 
strength of recommendation and encompasses the esti-
mated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to 
risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of sci-
entific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis 
of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical 
trials and other sources (Table 2).Table 1. Associated ACC/AHA Guidelines

2. BACKGROUND AND 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
2.1. Epidemiology
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most sustained common ar-
rhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increas-
ing in the United States and globally (Figures 1 to 3).1,2 
The increasing burden is multifactorial; causes include 
the aging of the population, rising tide of obesity, increas-
ing detection, and increasing survival with AF and other 
forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The estimated 
global prevalence was 50 million in 2020.2,3 Although 
the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the community is 
unknown, using back-calculation methodology, investiga-
tors have estimated that, in 2015, about 11% (591 000 
cases) of the >5.6 million AF cases in the United States 
were undiagnosed.4
AF is associated with higher health care utilization 
and costs.2 Using US data from Optum (an administra-
tive claims database for commercially insured [United 
Healthcare] patients in the United States), compared 
with patients without AF, patients with incident AF had 
an increased risk of inpatient visits and more cardiovas-
cular-related emergency department visits (relative risk 
[RR], 2.41 [95% CI, 2.35–2.47]).5 AF is costly. Examining 
Optum data, individuals with AF have annual health care

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationcosts of $63 031, which is $27 896 more than individu-
als without AF.5 Investigators examining public and pri-
vate health insurer data estimated that in US dollars in 
2016, AF accounted for $28.4 billion (95% CI, $24.6 
billion–$33.8 billion) in health care spending.6
2.1.1. Prevalence, Incidence, Morbidity, and 
Mortality
AF prevalence in the United States was estimated to 
be 5.2 million in 2010, with an expectation to rise to 
12.1 million in 2030.1 Corresponding estimates for US 
incidence was 1.2 million cases in 2010, with an ex-
pectation to rise to 2.6 million cases in 2030.1 The 
rate of AF diagnosis varies by education, income,2 
clinical,3,4 and genetic3 factors. Overall lifetime risk is 
about 30% to 40% in White individuals,2–4 about 20% 
in African American individuals,2 and about 15% in 
Chinese5 individuals.
AF is associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk 
of death6,7; studies suggest that the mortality risk may 
be higher in women than in men.6 In meta-analyses, 
AF is also associated with increased risk of multiple 
adverse outcomes, including a 2.4-fold risk of stroke,7 
1.5-fold risk of cognitive impairment or dementia,8 
1.5-fold risk of myocardial infarction (MI),9 2-fold risk 
of sudden cardiac death,10 5-fold risk of heart failure 
(HF),7 1.6-fold risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD),7 and 1.3-fold risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD).7 In 
Medicare beneficiaries, the most frequent outcome in 
the 5 years after AF diagnosis was death (19.5% at 1 
year; 48.8% at 5 years)11; the next most common diag-
nosis was HF (13.7%), followed by new-onset stroke 
(7 .1%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (5.7%), and MI 
(3.9%).11
2.1.2. Risk Factors and Associated Heart Disease
In Table 3, we present the evidence for the most widely 
reported and validated factors for AF from single stud-
ies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization stud-
ies. Risk factors include demographic, anthropometric, 
and cardiovascular risk factors, CVD, noncardiac con-
ditions, biomarkers (eg, electrocardiographic, imaging, 
circulating), and genetic markers.1 Models predicting 
risk of AF onset are presented in Section 4.1 (“Risk 
Stratification and Population Screening”). Most stud-
ies of AF risk factors and outcomes have been reported 
from high-income countries and in individuals of Euro-
pean ancestry.
2.2. Atrial Arrhythmia Classification and 
Definitions
2.2.1. AF Classification
The previous classification of AF, which was based only 
on arrhythmia duration, although useful, tended to em-
phasize AF once it was diagnosed and focused mainly 
on therapeutic interventions. The new proposed classi-
fication using stages aims to correct the deficiencies of 
the previous classification by recognizing AF as a pro-
gressive disease that requires different strategies at the 
different stages, from prevention to screening, to rate 
and rhythm control therapies. The different stages bet-
ter define AF as a progressive disease and highlight the 
need to address it at the earliest stages, especially em-
phasizing the importance of prevention, risk factor man-
agement, and timing for screening in those patients at 
the highest risk. The stages are not mutually exclusive  
(eg, risk factors should be managed through multiple 
stages) (Figure 4).
AF is the most common arrhythmia in the world and 
accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. Over 
the past decade, evidence has consistently shown that 
the best treatment of atrial fibrillation requires multiple 
stakeholders committed to providing comprehensive 
patient-centered care. In addition, as emphasized in this 
guideline, AF should be thought of in a more holistic 
sense over an individual patient’s lifetime.
The foundation of optimal AF management is the treat-
ment of risk factors and implementing lifestyle changes to 
decrease the likelihood of developing AF (Figure 5). Once 
AF develops, patient care should focus on assessing the 
risk of stroke and implementing any necessary treatment, 
continued optimization of all modifiable risk factors, and

Rates of AF-Prevalent Cases by Social Demographic Index 
Quintile for Both Sexes Combined, 1990–2017.
Trends in counts of AF-prevalent cases by SDI quintile, 1990–2017 . 
SDI was made up of the geometric mean of 3 common indicators: the 
lag distributed income per capita, mean educational achievement for 
those aged ≥15 y, and total fertility rate <25 y. SDI ranged from 0 to 
1, where 0 represents the theoretical minimum level of development, 
whereas 1 represents the theoretical maximum level of development.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationmanaging potential symptoms of AF, with an initial focus 
on evaluating and minimizing AF burden. However, as 
outlined in this guideline, access to all aspects of health 
care to all patients is necessary for any true improvement 
to be realized.
When AF develops, holistic and optimal care of the 
patient at risk for AF, or who has developed AF, can 
be simply modeled using a building. The foundation of 
care is treatment of comorbidities and risk factors and 
implementing behavioral change in all individuals to 
decrease the likelihood of developing AF and reducing 
its burden (Screening for all risk factors from HEAD 2 
TOES ). Once AF develops, there are 3 important care 
processes that must be specifically addressed with all 
patients and aligned with their goals of therapy: Stroke 
risk assessment and treatment, if appropriate, Opti-
mizing all modifiable risk factors, and Symptom man-
agement using rate- and rhythm-control strategies that consider AF burden in the context of an individual 
patient’s needs (SOS). The overarching principle for 
AF management is Access to All Aspects of care to 
All (4 As).
2.2.2. Associated Arrhythmias
Other atrial arrhythmias are often encountered in pa-
tients with AF.
Atrial Tachycardia (AT): It is a regular atrial rhythm at 
a constant rate of >100 beats per minute (bpm) with dis-
crete P waves and atrial activation sequences originating 
outside of the sinus node.1 The mechanism can be auto-
maticity, triggered activity, or a microreentry circuit. Focal 
ATs arise from a single discrete site within the left or right 
atrium, in contrast to macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias 
and AF, which involve multiple sites or larger circuits. In 
multifocal AT, the atrial activation sequence and P-wave 
morphology vary.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationAtrial Flutter (AFL) and Macroreentrant AT: They 
occur in many of the same situations as AF. T ypical AFL, 
also known as “typical AFL” or “cavotricuspid isthmus 
(CTI)-dependent AFL,”2 involves a macroreentrant circuit 
around the tricuspid annulus traversing the CTI on the 
right side of the heart (Figure 6). This is the arrhythmia 
associated with the classic electrocardiogram (ECG) 
finding of sawtooth flutter waves in the inferior leads 
when the circuit goes in the counterclockwise direc-
tion. The same circuit in the clockwise direction is called 
“reverse typical AFL.” If the flutter involves a different 
circuit than tricuspid valve/isthmus, then it is called 
“atypical” AFL, which is also known as “noncavotricuspid 
isthmus–dependent macroreentrant AT.”2 AFL was previ-
ously classified as either type I or type II. That terminol-
ogy is no longer used.
2.3. Mechanisms and Pathophysiology
AF is a chaotic, rapid (300-500 bpm), and irregu-
lar atrial rhythm. Although normal rhythms are con-
ducted through the atria in smooth waves initiated 
by the sinoatrial node, AF is the result of either elec-
trophysiological abnormalities that underlie impulse 
generation and/or structural abnormalities of cellular 
connections that typically facilitate rapid and uniform impulse conduction. AF often stems from waves of 
electrical activity originating from ectopic action po-
tentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary 
veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA),1 or in response 
to reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous  
conduction due to interstitial fibrosis.2 Atrial ectopy 
can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF 
requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or 
conduction that is sufficiently heterogeneous to enable 
reentrant activity to persist. The electrical abnormalities 
evident on the ECG during AF likely represent a shared 
phenotype of a condition with many distinct etiologies 
(genetic, environmental, and metabolic) (Figure 7).
2.3.1. Electrophysiological Mechanisms and 
Electrical Remodeling
The observation by Haissaguerre et al1 that ectopic fir-
ing from PVs triggers AF revolutionized treatments for 
AF. PV features that increase vulnerability for initiating 
ectopy include a higher resting membrane potential, 
stretch-activated channels,2 and pattern of cross myofi-
ber orientation.
Electrical remodeling, which can contribute to and 
result from AF, includes perturbations that culminate 
in abnormal Ca2+ handling and shortened, proarrhyth-
mic triangulated action potentials (eg, from decreased

During each annual GBD Study cycle, population health estimates are produced for the full-time series. Improvements in statistical and geospatial 
modeling methods and the addition of new data sources may lead to changes in past results across GBD Study cycles.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationCalcium mishandling from remodeling increases cal-
cium load in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and dysfunc-
tion of ryanodine receptors, which regulate intracellular 
calcium release. Remodeling in AF of sarcoplasmic 
reticulum calcium ATPase underlies sequestration of 
intracellular calcium between beats, and/or altered reg-
ulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 
by phospholamban and sarcolipin.11 Increased intra-
cellular sodium from calcium-calmodulin II-induced 
increased late sodium current or cardiac glycosides can 
also increase sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium through 
the sodium-calcium exchanger.12,13 Several upstream 
mechanisms (eg, oxidative stress, inflammatory signal-
ing) promote calcium-calmodulin II -activation. CaM-
KII-mediated and hyperphosphorylation of ryanodine 
receptor 2 promotes spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ leak 
by increasing ryanodine receptor 2 channel open prob-
ability, leading to higher intracellular Ca2+ levels and the 
milieu for delayed afterdepolarizations, the most likely 
trigger for AF initiation.14 Electrogenic action of sodium-
calcium exchanger drives afterdepolarizations, and 
expression of sodium-calcium exchanger is increased 
in HF and AF. Action potential alternans related to Ca2+ 
mishandling can be noted to precede AF onset and 
increases with age.
2.3.1.1. Triggers of AF
The atria of patients with AF tend to have both shorter 
effective refractory periods and slower conduction, which 
enhances dispersion of repolarization and favor reentry. 
This substrate is sensitive to AF initiation, frequently af-
ter premature atrial contractions (PACs).1 PAC burden is 
associated with development of AF.2 Larger LA volume, 
increased NT-proBNP levels, and impaired LA emptying 
are associated with increased PAC burden.3 In a study 
of 100 patients undergoing PV isolation, PACs induced 
41 episodes of AF in 22 patients, with most episodes originating in the PVs.4 Earlier studies also reported an 
LA gradient of background potassium currents, resulting 
in shorter LA than right atrial effective refractory period in 
patients with AF.5 Mapping studies of AF electrograms in 
canine models documented a left-right gradient of high 
frequency sources (drivers), with the highest frequency 
regions located near the PVs in the LA.6
2.3.2. Atrial Structural Abnormalities, Remodeling, 
and Atrial Myopathy
Atrial cardiomyopathy has been identified as “any com-
plex of structural, architectural, contractile or electrophysi-
ological changes affecting the atria with the potential to 
produce clinically relevant manifestations.”1 Atrial cardio-
myopathy is common, associated with aging and other 
comorbidities with metabolic or hemodynamic stress, and 
often leads to or results from AF. Structural and electrical 
remodeling promote AF and include interstitial changes, 
increased myofibroblast activity, and collagen deposi-
tion, fibrofatty deposits, altered ion channel expression, 
calcium signaling and contractility, and inflammatory in-
filtrates.1 Myeloperoxidase, an oxidase in neutrophils 
and macrophages, is associated with fibroblast activa-
tion, interstitial fibrosis, and inducibility of AF in a mouse 
model.2 Prothrombotic changes are often evident in the 
LA, including increased endocardial expression of von 
Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 changes, which may 
increase risk of thrombus formation and stroke.1
Experimental hemodynamic overload, such as revers-
ible aortopulmonary artery shunting promotes atrial 
dilation, atrial myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, 
alterations in extracellular matrix composition and vas-
cular dysfunction, and increased vulnerability to atrial 
ectopy and AF inducibility.3 Electrical remodeling similar 
to that seen during AF is observed, with characteristic

2.3.2.1. Upstream Pathways
Upstream pathways include inflammatory, oxidative stress, 
fibrosis, calcium handling, genetic, metabolic, obesity, 
and other mechanisms implicated in increasing suscep-
tibility to or progression of AF. The renin-angiotensin-al-
dosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, inflammatory 
signaling, and calcium overload are discussed here and 
in Section 2.3.1 (“Electrophysiological Mechanisms 
and Electrical Remodeling”). Upstream therapies are 
discussed in Section 8.3.4 (“Upstream Therapy”).
The RAAS regulates blood pressure (BP) and is 
activated in hypertension and obesity. RAAS activation 
promotes vascular smooth muscle constriction (increas-
ing BP), activates fibroblasts (increasing atrial intersti-tial collagen), and increases reactive oxygen species in 
the sympathetic nervous system. BP and weight control, 
including treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers, 
attenuate pathologic changes.
Oxidative stress is associated with: (1) activation of 
calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II1,2 and jun kinase 
2,3 which promotes ryanodine receptor phosphoryla-
tion and leads to spontaneous calcium release4; (2) 
increased late sodium current, INa,L, and lower calcium 
current amplitude; (3) formation of reactive lipid products 
(isolevuglandins) in hypertension5 and AF6; (4) activation 
of the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-
kappa B and the NLRP3 inflammasome7; (5) increase 
in mitochondrial and metabolic stress; (6) inflamma-
tory changes; and (7) myofilament protein degradation, 
impairing atrial contractility, which may increase throm-
boembolism risk.8Table 4. Definitions
Term Definition 
AF A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation and ineffective atrial contraction
Electrocardiographic characteristics include (1) irregular R-R intervals (when atrioventricular conduction is present), (2) absence of distinct 
P waves, and (3) irregular atrial activity also known as fibrillatory waves. AF can be documented by, for example, 12-lead ECG, rhythm strips, 
wearables, intracardiac electrograms, but will always require visual confirmation that the diagnosis is accurate.
Clinical AF With the increasing availability of wearable devices and other continuous monitoring technologies, the distinction between clinical and  
subclinical AF has become increasingly blurred, thus the writing committee felt the term clinical AF has become less useful. Yet, the term 
was kept because most of the evidence from randomized trials that have led to guideline recommendations for the treatment of AF refer to 
“clinical AF. ” These trials required electrocardiographic documentation of the arrhythmia for inclusion and most patients presented for  
clinical evaluation and/or therapy of the arrhythmia.
Subclinical AF Subclinical AF refers to this arrhythmia identified in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and in whom there are no  
previous ECGs documenting AF
This includes AF identified by implanted devices (pacemakers, defibrillators, or implantable loop recorders) or wearable monitors
Atrial high-rate  
episodesThese are defined as atrial events exceeding the programmed detection rate limit set by the device. These are recorded by implanted  
devices but require visual inspection to confirm AF and exclude other atrial arrhythmias, artifact or oversensing.
AF burden AF burden encompasses both frequency and duration and refers to the amount of AF that an individual has. AF burden has been defined  
differently across studies. For the purpose of this guideline, AF burden will be defined as the durations of an an episode or as a percentage 
of AF duration during the monitoring period depending on how it was defined in the individual studies.
First detected AF The first documentation of AF, regardless of previous symptoms
Paroxysmal AF AF that is intermittent and terminates within ≤7 d of onset
Persistent AF AF that is continuous and sustains for >7 d and requires intervention. Of note, patients with persistent AF who, with therapy, become parox-
ysmal should still be defined as persistent as this reflects their original pattern and is more useful to predict outcomes and define substrate.
Long-standing  
persistent AFAF that is continuous for >12 mo in duration
Permanent AF A term that is used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm
Acceptance of AF represents a therapeutic decision and does not represent an inherent pathophysiological attribute of AF
Terms considered obsolete
Chronic AF This historical term has had variable definitions and should be abandoned. It has been replaced by the “paroxysmal, ” “persistent, ” “long-
standing persistent, ” and “permanent” terminology.
Valvular and  
nonvalvular AFThe distinction between “valvular” and “nonvalvular “AF remains a matter of debate. Their definitions may be confusing. Recent trials  
comparing vitamin K antagonists with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in AF were performed among patients with so-called 
“nonvalvular” AF. These trials have all allowed native valvular heart disease other than mitral stenosis (mostly moderate and severe) and 
prosthetic heart valves to be included. We should no longer consider the classification of AF as ‘‘valvular’’ or “nonvalvular” for the purpose of 
defining the etiology of AF, since the term was specific for eligibility of stroke risk reduction therapies. Valvular and nonvalvular terminology 
should be abandoned.
Lone AF This term has been used in the past to identify AF in younger patients without structural heart disease who are at a lower risk for  
thromboembolism. This term does not enhance patient care, is not currently used, and should be abandoned.
AF indicates atrial fibrillation.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSystemic inflammatory activation, first documented 
with AF after cardiac surgery,9 has also been associated 
with nonsurgical AF.10 NLRP3 knockdown prevented AF 
inducibility in a mouse model, implicating the NLRP3 
inflammasome in AF pathophysiology.11 NLRP3-block-
ing drugs are in development.
2.3.2.2. Persistence of AF
In general, persistence of AF reflects the substrate for 
AF. A suitable substrate for AF has a wavelength (wave-
length = refractory period × conduction velocity) that is 
shorter than the dimensions of the tissue, with heterog-
enous conduction velocity and/or repolarization dura-
tion. Thus, an individual with large, fibrotic, and/or fatty 
atria is more likely to have persistent AF than one with a 
normal-sized atria with little interstitial fibrosis or adipose 
infiltration. Electrophysiologic remodeling is typically a 
response to persistent AF rather than the trigger.2.3.3. Role of the Autonomic Nervous System
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) has an important 
role as trigger and substrate (Figure 8).
ANS triggers AF
The ANS as AF trigger is detailed in several reviews.1–6 
Sympathetic efferent stimulation releases noradrenaline, 
stimulating G-coupled β-adrenergic receptors, enhancing 
L-type calcium channels, and increasing inward current 
(automaticity/early afterdepolarization). Delayed afterde-
polarization occurs via calcium overload and ryanodine-2 
receptor dysfunction. Parasympathetic stimulation short-
ens atrial effective refractory period by increasing IKACh 
(acetyl-choline receptor mediated inward rectifying po-
tassium channel) activity. Atrial effective refractory period 
heterogeneity follows the pattern of autonomic innerva-
tion. Sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, alone or 
combined, can trigger AF.

ent abnormalities disrupt blood volume and pressure 
homeostasis. Similar abnormalities to AF were identi-
fied in HF.14 Afferent ANS dysfunction could link au-
tonomic with anatomic remodeling (atrial dilatation15), 
contributing to AF self-perpetuation.
2.4. Genetics
Both common forms and familial AF are heritable.1–3 
Multiple recent genome-wide association studies have 
documented >100 loci specific for AF.4,5 Numerous 
AF loci appear consistent across multiethnic groups,5 with some population variation.6,7 With large genome-
wide genotyped cohorts such as the UK Biobank and 
the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s 
(NHLBI’s) Trans Omics for Precision Medicine, the ge-
netic architecture of AF is now emerging. A UK Bio-
bank study identified TTN loss of function variants in 
0.44% of participants, 14% of whom had AF.8 In a Trans 
Omics for Precision Medicine study of nearly 1300 par-
ticipants <66 years of age with AF, 10.1% harbored a 
disease-associated genetic variant in genes associated 
with inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndromes 
(most common were TTN, MYH7, MYH6, LMNA, and 
KCNQ1), and 62.8% had variants of undetermined sig-
nificance. Disease-associated variants were more prev-
alent at younger age of AF onset, 16.8% in those <30 
years.9 A smaller study of persons of Hispanic or African 
American descent reported 7% of persons with AF on-
set at ≤ 66 years of age harbored rare likely pathogenic 
or pathogenic sequence variants, mostly in myocardial 
structural proteins and ion channels.10

The pathways that contribute to the development of AF create a substrate for reentry and provide triggers that can initiate arrhythmic activity.

1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF, regardless of sex1 and gender  
diversity, race and ethnicity,2 or adverse social  
determinants of health (SDOH),3,4* should be  
equitably offered guideline-directed stroke risk  
reduction therapies as well as rate or rhythm control 
strategies and LRFM as indicated to improve quality 
of life (QOL) and prevent adverse outcomes.
*Including lower income, lower education, inadequate or lack of insurance cov-
erage, or rurality.3–5
Synopsis
Inequities in AF care and outcomes in individuals who are 
women, from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups 
(UREGs),2 or who have adverse SDOH have been docu-
mented.3,4 Sex differences in AF treatment have been 
described with respect to anticoagulation6,7 and rhythm 
control therapy approaches.7–9 Racial and ethnic differ-
ences in clinical presentation, management, and progno-
sis, including stroke, HF, and death, in patients with AF 
are widely reported.2,10
To avoid guidelines having the unintended con-
sequence of widening inequities in clinical care and outcomes in individuals with AF, it is essential to longitu-
dinally measure the receipt of AF GDMT and outcomes 
at the clinical practice and health system levels stratified 
by specific populations who have historically experienced 
inequitable care. If inequities are identified, barriers to 
GDMT should be eliminated. Data are needed to assess 
the impact of addressing SDOH in patients with AF on 
process measures, health care utilization, costs, and 
clinical outcomes.11 In other health contexts, there are 
observational and randomized data12 that screening and 
addressing SDOH leads to improved medication adher-
ence,13 risk factor control,14 and clinical outcomes.15

their counterparts, they also are less likely to be

3. SHARED DECISION-MAKING (SDM) IN 
AF MANAGEMENT
Recommendation for SDM in AF Management
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
2b B-R 1. In patients with AF, the use of evidence-based  
decision aids might be useful to guide stroke  
reduction therapy treatment decisions throughout  
the disease course to improve engagement,  
decisional quality, and patient satisfaction.1–4
Synopsis
There are wide variations in how SDM is implemented 
in clinical care settings.5,6 Decision aids may provide 
standardization of SDM approaches for better informing 
patients about stroke reduction therapies and improve 
patient-reported measures but to date have not consis-
tently been developed with recommended frameworks, 
have rarely been tested in systemically disadvantaged 
populations (low health literacy, UREGs, low socioeco-
nomic status, rural geography, older adults), and have had 
variable impact on adherence and clinical outcomes.1–8 
Ongoing work will measure health and digital literacy and 
strengthen the evidence for the impact of decision aids 
on decisional quality, adherence to treatment, and health 
outcomes.9
Symptom severity strongly correlates with QOL; 
thus, minimizing symptoms is an essential component 
of patient-centered AF management decisions. Rhythm 
control strategies improve QOL, particularly when main-
tenance of sinus rhythm or low AF burden is achieved.10 
Notably, few SDM decision aids are focused on rate or 
rhythm control treatment options, and few have mea-
sured QOL as an outcome.3,5
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Recently, 2 comprehensive reviews of deci-
sion aids for stroke reduction therapies were conducted to determine the impact of these tools 
on patient-reported measures of decisional qual-
ity, while considering other important outcomes 
including oral anticoagulant (OAC) uptake, medi-
cation adherence, and the effect on bleeding and 
stroke.3,4 Most decision aids focused on patient- 
reported measures, and few underwent rigorous 
pilot testing or correlated the aid with clinical out-
comes, such as stroke and bleeding. Decision aids 
consistently demonstrate improvements in patient 
knowledge. The pooled analysis by Song et al 
noted lower decisional conflict using decision aids 
and enhanced OAC uptake (risk ratio, 1.03 [95% 
CI, 1.01-1.05]).4 Decision aids have historically 
shown marginal improvement in 3-month mea-
sures of adherence, and the 2 largest randomized 
trials to date showed no improvement in adher-
ence between decision aids and usual care at 1 
year.1,2 There is a paucity of data on the impact of 
decision aids on stroke, thromboembolic events, or 
bleeding, and when assessed the benefit has been 
minimal or neutral.4,11 Despite the US Centers for 
Medicaid & Medicare Services coverage decision 
requirement for SDM for percutaneous left atrial 
appendage occlusion (LAAO), only 1 tool was 
identified that incorporated this option (Table 5).5

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationthyroid disease [hyperthyroidism, 1 point]) was derived 
and validated in Asian cohorts (Table 7).3,4
Screening for AF has been investigated, mostly in 
patients >65 years of age, using various protocols that 
include both 1-time electrocardiographic recordings, 
recurring intermittent ECGs (including consumer-based 
devices), or continuous electrocardiographic external 
monitors. Most screening trials have shown higher AF 
detection using intermittent or continuous electrocardio-
graphic recordings5 and higher AF detection in patients 
with higher predicted risk for AF.6 A recent study also 
showed that an AI algorithm able to risk-stratify a rel-
atively uniform population (eg, older adults at risk for 
stroke) to detect undiagnosed AF during short-term car-
diac monitoring was associated with increased AF.7 Con-
versely, mass population screening with a smartwatch app 
only rarely detected a new diagnosis of AF.8 Ultimately, 
for risk stratification models and screening programs to 
be useful, they would need to improve outcomes and be cost-effective.9 It is not yet established that patients at 
high risk of developing AF by a validated risk score ben-
efit from screening and interventions to improve rates of 
ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and survival.

Recommendations for Basic Clinical Evaluation
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. In patients with newly diagnosed AF, a transthoracic 
echocardiogram1–4 to assess cardiac structure, 
laboratory testing to include a complete blood count, 
metabolic panel, and thyroid function,5–7 and when 
clinical suspicion exists, targeted testing to assess 
for other medical conditions associated with AF are 
recommended to determine stroke and bleeding 
risk factors, as well as underlying conditions that will 
guide further management.
3: No 
benefitB-NR 2. In patients with newly diagnosed AF, protocolized 
testing for ischemia, acute coronary syndrome  
(ACS), and pulmonary embolism (PE) should not  
routinely be performed to assess the etiology of  
AF unless there are additional signs or symptoms  
to indicate those disorders.8–10
Synopsis
The initial clinical evaluation of the patient with newly 
diagnosed or suspected AF should be focused on con-
firming the diagnosis and identifying relevant clinical 
factors that will impact management. A targeted history 
and physical examination should be performed at the ini-
tial assessment and repeated during periodic follow-up, 
especially given the evolving risk of thromboembolism 
and the cadence of symptoms in response to therapy 
(see Section 11, “Future Research Needs”). An ECG 
can assess other electrical abnormalities, including pos-
sible substrates such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) 
syndrome, coexisting atrial arrhythmias, as well as ab-
normalities that may affect decision-making in pharma-
cological management (eg, bradycardia, QT duration). 
Basic laboratory tests should be performed to deter-
mine if other clinically relevant disorders are present 
and impact on management, particularly with respect 
to stroke and bleeding risk. A transthoracic echocardio-
gram provides information on chamber size, thickness, 
function, and the presence of valvular pathology. Addi-
tional testing, including multimodality advanced imaging 
and further ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, 
may be pursued based on the results of these initial 
evaluations. AF itself does not increase the likelihood of 
myocardial ischemia, ACS or PE, and therefore routine 
testing for these disorders in the absence of signs or 
symptoms is of no benefit.

ejection fraction (L VEF) impacts decisions for anti-
arrhythmic drug therapy and whether to prioritize 
other rhythm control therapies, including catheter 
ablation. Additionally, strain imaging may suggest 
an underlying infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such 
as amyloidosis.1 Echocardiography also provides 
information on LA size and function. Altered LA 
compliance is known to be associated with AF11 
and progression toward persistent-type AF.2 In a 
meta-analysis, AF recurrence after ablation was 
associated with a lower LA strain,3 while LA vol-
ume was a stronger predictor of recurrence after 
ablation than the characterization of AF as parox-
ysmal or persistent.4 Laboratory testing can detect 
other medical conditions that are associated with 
AF and would impact therapeutic decision-making, 
such as CKD,5 liver dysfunction,6 and hyperthyroid-
ism.7,12 Laboratory testing may also reveal electro-
lyte abnormalities, including from medications such 
as diuretics. Laboratory testing is also needed to 
determine stroke risk and bleeding risk factors, 
which will guide management decisions. When 
clinical suspicion exists, additional testing might be 
needed to evaluate for potentially related condi-
tions, such as significant valvular disease.
 2. The presence of AF itself should not prompt rou-
tine protocolized testing for myocardial ischemia, 
ACS, or PE, in the absence of signs or symptoms 
to suggest those diseases. A retrospective analysis 
of asymptomatic patients with AF compared with 
age- and sex-matched controls that were referred 
for myocardial stress imaging found no difference 
in mean summed stress score or rate of abnormal 
studies.8 A retrospective analysis of 1700 asymp-
tomatic AF patients (no chest pain or dyspnea) 
found that 4.6% had >5% ischemic myocardium, 
and the yield to detect ischemia that resulted in 
revascularization was only 0.4%.9 Among patients 
suspected of PE, a retrospective analysis showed 
that the presence of AF did not increase the prob-
ability of PE.10 Certainly, this would not preclude 
from evaluating patients with signs and/or symp-
toms of ischemia and PE.
4.2.2. Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods
Recommendations for Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. Among individuals without a known history of AF, it  
is recommended that an initial AF diagnosis be made 
by a clinician using visual interpretation of the  
electrocardiographic signals, regardless of the type  
of rhythm or monitoring device.1–51 B-NR 2. In patients with an intracardiac rhythm device 
capable of a diagnosis of AF, such as from an atrial 
pacemaker lead, a diagnosis of AF should only be 
made after it is visually confirmed by reviewing  
intracardiac tracings to exclude signal artifacts  
and other arrhythmias.6–9
2a B-R 3. For patients who have had a systemic  
thromboembolic event without a known history of  
AF and in whom maximum sensitivity to detect AF  
is sought, an implantable cardiac monitor is  
reasonable.10,11
2a B-NR 4. Among patients with a diagnosis of AF, it is reason-
able to infer AF frequency, duration, and burden using 
automated algorithms available from electrocardio-
graphic monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and 
cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead, recognizing 
that periodic review can be required to exclude other 
arrythmias.1,4,5,12
2a B-R 5. Among patients with AF in whom cardiac monitor-
ing is advised, it is reasonable to recommend use of 
a consumer-accessible electrocardiographic device 
that provides a high-quality tracing to detect recur-
rences.13
Synopsis
Monitoring options for AF include a standard 12-lead 
ECG, continuously recording or loop-recording electro-
cardiographic monitors using separate electrodes or 
as patches, implantable cardiac monitors (sometimes 
referred to as implantable loop recorders), cardiac 
rhythm management devices with an atrial lead (eg, 
pacemakers and defibrillators), handheld ECGs, and 
smartwatches. Photoplethysmography has been used 
to infer AF from irregular pulse patterns using a variety 
of devices, predominately smartphone cameras14 and 
smartwatches.15–18 Electrocardiographic monitors of-
ten deploy automated algorithms for AF detection, but 
due to variable accuracy,1–5 the initial diagnosis should 
rely on a health care professional’s examination of the 
electrocardiographic tracing. Although photoplethys-
mography monitors may alert individuals to obtain an 
electrocardiographic tracing, it is not sufficiently reliable 
to establish an AF diagnosis.14–18 AF detected from an 
atrial lead has been validated versus surface ECGs6,7 
and independently predicts stroke.8,9 RCTs have dem-
onstrated that implantable cardiac monitors exhibit the 
highest sensitivity in detecting AF compared with ex-
ternal ambulatory monitors, likely related to the longer 
duration of monitoring.10,11 Automated algorithms to an-
alyze electrocardiographic devices have generally been 
found to be sufficiently reliable to infer the frequency, 
duration, and burden of AF among those with an AF di-
agnosis.1,4,5,12 A randomized trial showed that a handheld 
electrocardiographic monitor resulted in earlier detec-
tion of recurrent AF.13Recommendations for Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods

 1. Although automated algorithms in various devices 
are generally reliable, health care profes-
sional overread of electrocardiographic trac-
ings remains necessary given the imperfect test 
characteristics of those algorithms.1–5 Similarly, 
while algorithms utilizing photoplethysmography 
signals (derived using smartphones or smart-
watches) to infer irregular heart rates can dis-
criminate AF from normal sinus rhythm, these 
are not sufficiently reliable to establish an AF 
diagnosis.14–18
 2. Cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead have 
been shown to detect AF validated against con-
ventional surface electrocardiographic tracings.6–8 
In addition, both the presence and duration of AF 
detected solely by these devices predict stroke 
in a manner that would be expected of AF.8,9 It 
is still essential that the intracardiac tracings are 
reviewed for confirmation because false-positives 
are possible. The duration of AF that mandates 
intervention with anticoagulation will be dis-
cussed in Section 6.4.1 (“Oral Anticoagulation 
for Device-Detected Atrial High-Rate Episodes 
Among Patients Without a Previous Diagnosis 
of AF”).
 3. The more frequent and longer monitoring for AF 
is deployed, the greater the sensitivity in detecting 
AF.10,19 Randomized trials, predominately among 
cryptogenic stroke patients, have revealed that 
implantable cardiac monitors exhibit the highest 
sensitivity in detecting AF in view of extended 
monitoring periods compared with external 
monitors.10,11
 4. It is often not feasible to manually review all elec-
trocardiographic strips from various monitoring 
devices, either due to inaccessibility or time and 
resource constraints on health care professionals. 
Although variability in accuracy across different 
devices may be present, the validity demonstrated 
in automated algorithms is generally sufficient 
to infer frequency, duration, and burden of AF 
using electrocardiographic devices such as con-
tinuously wearable monitors, implantable cardiac 
monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an 
atrial lead.1,4,5,12
 5. Cardiac monitoring may be advised to AF patients 
for various reasons, such as for detecting recur-
rences, screening, or response to therapy. Among 
patients with AF who are undergoing cardiover-
sion or AF ablation, a single-center, randomized 
trial demonstrated that use of a self-administered 
handheld ECG resulted in earlier detection of 
recurrent AF13 and possibly improvement in sur-
vey-determined AF-related QOL20 compared with 
usual care.5. LIFESTYLE AND RISK FACTOR

MANAGEMENT
5.1. Primary Prevention
Recommendation for Primary Prevention
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-NR 1. Patients at increased risk of AF should receive com-
prehensive guideline-directed LRFM for AF, targeting 
obesity,1 physical inactivity,2 unhealthy alcohol con-
sumption,3 smoking,4 diabetes,5 and hypertension.6
Synopsis
The clinical, family history, and genetic risk factors for 
AF are well established (Table 3), and risk prediction 
models (Section 4.1, “Risk Stratification and Pop-
ulation Screening”) for AF have been reported and 
replicated.7–9 Multiple reports have established that 
maintenance of optimal risk factors and ideal cardiovas-
cular health are associated with substantially reduced 
risk of AF10,11 onset and complications (Section 5,  
“Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modification [LRFM] for 
AF Management”). To reduce risk of AF onset, indi-
viduals in the general population, particularly those at 
increased risk of AF, should receive comprehensive in-
tegrated LRFM, including maintenance of ideal weight 
and weight loss if overweight or obese1,12; pursue a 
physically active lifestyle,2 particularly if sedentary; re-
ceive smoking cessation counseling and/or medica-
tions4; moderate (≤ 1 standard alcoholic drink/day) or 
abstain from alcohol and avoidance of binge drinking3; 
control diabetes5; and control BP in accordance with 
GDMT.6,13 There is also an association of cannabis, co-
caine, methamphetamine, or opiate use with increased 
incidence of AF.14

 1. Most cardiovascular risk factors are associated 
with increased risk of new-onset AF. Observational 
studies have demonstrated that obesity and physi-
cal inactivity each independently increase the risk 
of newly diagnosed AF.1,2,12,15–20 However, caution 
should be considered in pursuing years of regular, 
high-volume (≥3 h/day) high-intensity endurance 
training given observational data linking it with 
increased AF risk21–23 in men and similar “J” curve 
risk curve observed for high or vigorous activity in 
both men and women in another study.24 Alcohol 
consumption enhances the risk of AF in a fairly 
linear fashion, with clear evidence that binge drink-
ing heightens the risk.3,25–29 Uncertainty persists 
regarding harms or benefits of no more than 1 
regular drink per day.28,29 Self-reported,4 biomarker-

sation is associated with decreased risk of incident 
AF.4 The presence of either type 1 or type 2 diabe-
tes increases AF risk,5,32 with evidence that worse 
glucose control correlates with a higher probability 
of developing AF.33 Hypertension is the risk factor 
with the highest attributable risk for AF10; intensive 
BP control lowers the risk of incident AF in obser-
vational and randomized data.6 Effective strategies 
to manage risk factors and prevent CVD have been 
reported elsewhere.12,13
5.2. Secondary Prevention: Management of 
Comorbidities and Risk Factors
5.2.1. Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are 
Overweight or Obese
Recommendation for Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are Overweight 
or Obese
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-R 1. In patients with AF who are overweight or obese  
(with body mass index [BMI] >27 kg/m2), weight  
loss is recommended, with an ideal target of at least 
10% weight loss to reduce AF symptoms, burden, 
recurrence, and progression to persistent AF.1–4
Synopsis
Obesity is associated with the development and pro-
gression of AF.5 It results in direct changes to the atrial 
myocardium forming the substrate for AF.6–8 In addition, 
obesity is also associated with several comorbidities that 
have been independently associated with the develop-
ment of AF.9,10 Obesity has a significant adverse impact 
on attempts to maintain sinus rhythm, with each 5-unit 
increase in BMI being associated with a 10% and 13% 
greater risk of postoperative and postablation AF, re-
spectively.5,11,12 Management of weight is important in the 
prevention and treatment of AF.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In an RCT in overweight and obese individuals with 
BMI >27 kg/m2 and AF, weight loss, as part of a 
comprehensive LRFM program, was associated 
with reduction in arrhythmia symptoms, recurrence, 
and burden.1 Observational studies demonstrated 
graded responses commensurate with the degree 
of weight loss, with achievement of at least 10% 
weight loss associated with greater maintenance 
of sinus rhythm,2 improved ablation outcomes,3 
and reversal of AF type.4 In observational stud-
ies, bariatric surgery in Class III obese individuals 
(BMI ≥40 kg/m2) with AF was associated with 
improved sinus rhythm maintenance after catheter 
ablation13,14 and reversal of AF type.15 The greater 
number of risk factors managed associated with 
likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm.16 However, a small observational study in individuals with obe-
sity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) with long-lasting persistent 
AF observed no difference in symptoms or sinus 
rhythm maintenance despite significant weight 
loss, suggesting that there may be extreme sub-
strates in which a weight loss strategy may not be 
effective.17
  Structured programs with regular review of prog-
ress facilitate achievement of weight loss and 
appear essential, as demonstrated by inability to 
reduce AF burden in a small RCT that achieved 
only 4.5% weight loss in the intervention arm.
5.2.2. Physical Fitness
Recommendation for Physical Fitness
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-R 1. In individuals with AF,* moderate-to-vigorous exercise 
training to a target of 210 minutes per week is rec-
ommended to reduce AF symptoms1–3 and burden,2,3 
increase maintenance of sinus rhythm,3–5 increase 
functional capacity, and improve QOL.3,5,6
*In patients without AF related to excessive exercise training.
Synopsis
Randomized trials provide evidence that prescribed aero-
bic exercise interventions may reduce arrhythmia burden 
in those with nonpermanent AF2 and improve functional 
capacity and health-related QOL in both permanent1,6 
and nonpermanent AF.2 In the ACTIVE-AF (An Exercise 
and Physical Activity Program in Patients With Atrial Fi-
brillation) study, an exercise intervention combining home 
and supervised aerobic exercise over 6 months resulted 
in greater freedom from arrhythmia recurrence, reduced 
burden, and improved QOL.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In patients with nonpermanent AF, aerobic exercise 
training may contribute to a reduction in AF bur-
den and improve maintenance of sinus rhythm.2–5 
Aerobic exercise interventions reduce severity of 
AF symptoms, increase functional capacity, and 
improve health-related QOL among patients with 
both nonpermanent and permanent AF.1,3,6 Initiation 
of or continuing regular exercise after develop-
ment of AF was associated with a lower risk of HF 
and mortality in a population-based cohort study.7 
Exercise training should be moderate- to vigorous-
intensity aerobic exercise, with a target of 210 min-
utes per week, and should be prescribed to reduce 
the frequency and duration of AF episodes, while 
improving cardiorespiratory fitness and symptom 
severity.3 Exercise prescription may be further 
modified to patient comorbidities, such as obesity, 
hypertension, and diabetes.4 Caution should be 
applied to ensure adequate ventricular rate con-
trol during exercise training and absence of atrial

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationmyopathy related to excessive exercise training. 
To date, there is little evidence that high-intensity 
aerobic exercise may be favorable over moderate-
intensity activities,8 and extreme levels of exer-
cise have been associated with higher incidence 
of AF.9,10 Exercise training may be delivered as a 
stand-alone intervention or as a component of mul-
tidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise-based 
cardiac rehabilitation improves QOL and functional 
capacity among patients with AF undergoing abla-
tion,11,12 although available studies have not been 
adequately powered to assess AF-specific out-
comes, such as arrhythmia recurrence.13 There is 
mixed evidence for a reduction in hospitalization or 
all-cause mortality with exercise training or exer-
cise-based cardiac rehabilitation.12,14,15
5.2.3. Smoking Cessation
Recommendation for Smoking Cessation
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-NR 1. Patients with a history of AF who smoke cigarettes 
should be strongly advised to quit smoking and  
should receive GDMT for tobacco cessation1,2 to 
mitigate increased risks of AF-related cardiovascular 
complications and other adverse outcomes.3–6
Synopsis
Observational data support that cigarette smoking in 
individuals with AF is associated with worse cardiovas-
cular outcomes and death and that individuals with AF 
who quit smoking are less likely to develop stroke or 
die. Despite the benefits of smoking cessation, individu-
als with AF are less likely to receive smoking cessation 
management than counterparts without AF.7,8 Patients 
with AF should be strongly advised to quit cigarette 
smoking9 and should receive GDMT for tobacco ces-
sation, including behavioral interventions10,11 and phar-
macotherapy.2
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In individuals with AF, cigarette smoking was asso-
ciated with poorer outcomes. For individuals who 
have undergone AF catheter ablation, current 
cigarette smoking was associated with increased 
risk for AF recurrence.12,13 Cigarette smoking was 
associated with less time in therapeutic range for 
patients on warfarin.14 Although some heteroge-
neity exists, the preponderance of studies have 
reported that individuals with AF who smoked ciga-
rettes had increased risks of stroke,3,4 H F,5 hospi-
talization,6 and death.6,15 Of concern, studies have 
reported that individuals with AF (versus those 
without) were less likely to receive smoking cessa-
tion interventions.7,8 Observational studies suggest 
that compared with current smokers, individuals 
with AF who quit smoking after AF diagnosis were less likely to experience CVD,3 stroke,3,16 and all-
cause mortality.16
5.2.4. Alcohol Consumption
Recommendation for Alcohol Consumption
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-R 1. Patients with AF seeking a rhythm-control strategy 
should minimize or eliminate alcohol consumption to 
reduce AF recurrence and burden.1–3
Synopsis
Among patients with a diagnosis of AF, randomized trials 
have demonstrated a reduction in AF burden on assign-
ment to abstinence,1 that alcohol acutely changes human 
electrophysiology in a fashion that renders the atria more 
prone to fibrillate,2 and suggest that avoiding alcohol can 
reduce the risk of a near-term AF event.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Among patients with AF, a case-crossover study 
revealed a higher risk of a discrete AF episode 
hours after objectively confirmed alcohol consump-
tion.4 In the context of a structured comprehensive 
management of risk factors, alcohol abstinence1 
or reduction to ≤3 standard drinks per week has 
been demonstrated to reduce AF symptoms,5 AF 
burden,6,7 and progression of AF from paroxysmal 
to persistent.8
5.2.5. Caffeine Consumption
Recommendation for Caffeine Consumption
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
3: No 
BenefitB-NR 1. For patients with AF, recommending caffeine  
abstention to prevent AF episodes is of no benefit, 
although it may reduce symptoms in patients who 
report caffeine triggers or worsens AF symptoms.1–9
Synopsis
A randomized N-of-1 trial,2 as well as longitudinal, ob-
servational studies, have generally found that caffeine 
consumed within normal limits is either associated 
with no heightened risk3–6 or a reduced risk of incident 
AF.3,5,7–9 Patients often report caffeine as a trigger of

Mendelian randomization studies examining caf-
feine metabolism-related genetic variants as 
instrumental-variable surrogates of caffeine 
consumption have not shown either a harm-
ful or protective effect related to incident AF.8,11 
Several case reports have described a relation-
ship between excessive consumption of caffeine 
(involving overdoses or highly caffeinated energy 
drinks)12,13 and AF in young, healthy individuals. 
Individuals should not begin or increase their caf-
feine consumption with the intent of reducing 
their AF risk.Patients often report that caffeine 
triggers their AF,10,14 although this has neither 
been supported by nor extensively studied in an 
objective manner. Current studies cannot exclude 
the possibility of individual-level idiosyncratic 
relationships between caffeine and AF. It is also 
possible that caffeine exacerbates symptoms of 
AF, or causes similar symptoms of palpitations, or 
enhances heart rhythm awareness.
5.2.6. Diet and Dietary Supplementation
Promoting a healthy diet is an effective strategy for pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease. The evidence pertain-
ing to the prevention of AF using dietary supplements is 
inconsistent, complicated by substantial misclassification 
and difficulties controlling for potential confounding fac-
tors associated with dietary interventions.
Several studies have evaluated the role of omega-3 
fatty acids and AF, demonstrating an inverse relation-
ship between plasma omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acid levels and prevalent AF.1,2 However, with supple-
mentation there has been no effect or a potential for 
greater AF.3–7 Although vitamin D supplementation is 
not useful on a population basis,8,9 its use in the peri-
operative period in deficient individuals reduces AF.10 
Similarly, ascorbic acid has been beneficial in reduc-
ing postoperative AF in some studies, although not 
uniformly.11
The importance of weight management on AF 
symptoms, burden, and recurrence is increasingly rec-
ognized,12,13 leading to various dietary interventions. 
Although evidence on diets is still evolving, analyses of 
the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study 
caution using low-carbohydrate diets, which were found 
to increase the risk of incident AF, regardless of the type 
of protein or fat used to replace carbohydrate.14
5.2.7. Diabetes
AF and diabetes are associated with increased risk of car-
diovascular mortality and sudden death.1 In patients with 
diabetes, vascular mortality was lower in patients treated 
with DOACs compared with warfarin.2 In patients with AF 
and diabetes undergoing catheter ablation, optimal glyce-
mic control preablation may lessen the risk of AF recur-
rence postablation.35.2.8. Treatment of Hypertension
Recommendation for the Treatment of Hypertension
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-NR 1. For patients with AF and hypertension, optimal BP 
control is recommended to reduce AF recurrence  
and AF-related cardiovascular events.1–7
Synopsis
Renal denervation and mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists (MRAs) have been associated with de-
creased AF burden in clinical trials.1,2 The only ran-
domized trial singularly targeting BP control as a 
mechanism to reduce the recurrence of AF8 showed 
no significant difference in the primary outcome of 
recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 
months’ postablation among the 2 groups. However, 
clinical trials of integrated comprehensive LRFM pro-
grams in conjunction with rhythm control therapies for 
AF have resulted in longer arrhythmia-free survival 
and decreased AF burden.3,5,9 Among patients with AF, 
treating elevated BP to guideline-directed goals re-
duces major cardiovascular events.9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In patients with AF, treatment of hypertension 
should aim for current BP guidelines to reduce 
stroke, bleeding, and other adverse outcomes.5,10 
An RCT of patients with paroxysmal AF and 
hypertension noted fewer recurrences among 
participants treated with renal denervation and 
pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) compared with 
PVI alone.2 Randomized studies of mineralo-
corticoid receptor antagonists for hypertension 
have been shown to reduce AF burden, and ACE 
inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers 
have been associated with lower AF incidence in 
secondary analyses of RCTs (see Section 8.3.4,  
“Upstream Therapy”). In addition, several inte-
grated LRFM programs that have resulted in 
a decrease in BP have been associated with 
a decreased recurrence of AF.3,11The SMAC 
(Substrate Modification With Aggressive Blood 
Pressure Control) AF trial randomized hyperten-
sive patients scheduled for AF ablation to stan-
dard or aggressive BP treatment with a systolic 
BP target of 120 or 140 mm Hg.8 No significant 
difference was shown in recurrent symptomatic 
atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 months postablation 
(median follow-up, 14 months), and this is the 
only RCT to date singularly targeting BP control 
as a mechanism to reduce AF recurrence.8 Post 
hoc analyses of DOAC clinical trials to reduce 
the risk of stroke in patients with AF have con-
sistently found lower rates of stroke in patients 
with controlled BP.6,7

2b B-NR 1. Among patients with AF, it may be reasonable to 
screen for obstructive sleep apnea, given its high 
prevalence in patients with AF, although the role of 
treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to 
maintain sinus rhythm is uncertain.1–13
Synopsis
SDB is a risk factor for the development of incident AF, and 
more severe SDB acutely increases the risk of a discrete 
AF episode.14–18 Independent of SDB, poor sleep quality is 
associated with an increased risk of developing incident 
AF.19–21 When formal testing for SDB is used, the disease 
is frequently observed in >20% of patients with an AF di-
agnosis.1–5 Observational studies suggest that treatment of 
SDB may reduce the risk of AF recurrence and AF burden, 
but RCTs have not been adequately powered to reveal a 
relationship between treating SDB and reduced AF.6–13
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. The prevalence of SDB is remarkably and consis-
tently high in patients with AF (generally substan-
tially >20% and sometimes >50% regardless of 
the type of AF population assessed), is often unde-
tected, and, as conventional symptoms of SDB may 
be absent, may require formal study to establish a 
diagnosis of SDB.1–5,11 Multiple observational stud-
ies have described fewer recurrences of AF and a 
reduction in AF burden, including after cardiover-
sion and catheter ablation procedures, among those 
undergoing treatment for SDB compared with those 
not treated for their SDB.6–11, 22 However, small trials 
randomizing patients with AF and SDB treatment 
versus usual care have not shown significant differ-
ences in AF burden or AF recurrence, including after 
cardioversion or PVI ablation,12,13,22 although stud-
ies tended to exclude patients who might benefit 
most from SDB treatment (eg, those who had more 
symptomatic sleep apnea [Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale score >10 or 15], severe cardiovascular dis-
ease [L VEF <40% or 45%], or severe obesity).
5.2.10. Comprehensive Care
Recommendations for Comprehensive Care
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 A 1. Patients with AF should receive comprehensive care 
addressing guideline-directed LRFM, AF symptoms, 
risk of stroke, and other associated medical conditions 
to reduce AF burden, progression, or consequences.1–3
2a B-R 2. In patients with AF, use of clinical care pathways,  
such as nurse-led AF clinics, is reasonable to  
promote comprehensive, team-based care and to 
enhance adherence to evidence-based therapies for 
AF and associated conditions.4–6Synopsis
Almost all patients with AF have multiple conditions that 
either increase AF risk or are exacerbated by AF. Patients 
with AF are also at risk of developing thromboembolism, 
stroke, and HF, so a comprehensive approach tailored to 
the needs of the individual patient should improve out-
comes. Randomized trials have shown that interventions 
aimed at AF risk factors, such as alcohol use, overweight, 
and HF, reduce AF burden. Clinical care pathways and 
algorithms for AF management, including LRFM, have 
shown promise in randomized trials through coordinat-
ing care and facilitating comprehensive AF management.
Although comprehensive care of the multiple condi-
tions associated with AF is logical, it is unclear whether 
integrated care by a multidisciplinary team leads to better 
outcomes than comprehensive care by a single clinician 
applying an evidence-based AF clinical care algorithm or 
pathway. Nevertheless, coordination of care among mul-
tiple clinicians should also improve care, even though it 
has not been evaluated rigorously.7
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Randomized trials have shown the efficacy of many 
individual components of patient-centered care for 
AF, as discussed earlier in this section. Several 
randomized and nonrandomized studies have uti-
lized comprehensive programs for patients with 
AF.2,8,9 The RACE 3 (Rate Control versus Electrical 
cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation) trial3 
found that multifaceted treatment for patients with 
AF and early HF (with mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists, statins, ACE inhibitors and/or angio-
tensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and cardiac reha-
bilitation) improved maintenance of sinus rhythm.
 2. Various clinical care pathways, algorithms, and 
electronic clinical decision support systems for the 
care of patients with AF have been tested in clinical 
trials, with mixed results. Care provided by specialty 
nurses using a clinical support system aimed at 
enhancing adherence to guideline-directed thera-
pies improved cardiovascular outcomes in a single 
center study4 but not in the subsequent multicenter 
RACE 4 trial, where results were associated with 
experience of the center, although adherence to 
guideline-based recommendations was still greatly 
improved.10 In a cluster randomized trial of elderly 
patients with AF where integrated care intervention 
consisting of (a) quarterly AF check-ups by trained 
nurses in primary care, also focusing on comorbidi-
ties, (b) monitoring of anticoagulation therapy in pri-
mary care, and finally (c) easy-access availability of 
consultations from cardiologists and anticoagula-
tion clinics, the patients assigned to integrated care 
experienced a 45% reduction in all-cause mortality 
when compared with usual care.11 In another study

COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual 
risk of thromboembolic events using a validated  
clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc.1–4
1 B-NR 2. Patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that  
specifically indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such 
as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase 
bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interven-
tions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation.5–7
2a C-LD 3. Patients with AF at intermediate annual risk of 
thromboembolic events by risk scores (eg, equiva-
lent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in 
women), who remain uncertain about the benefit of 
anticoagulation, can benefit from consideration of 
factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help 
inform the decision.*
3: No 
BenefitB-NR 4. In patients who are deemed at high risk for stroke, 
bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation 
to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but 
instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors 
and to inform medical decision-making.8–10
*Factors may include AF burden or other features in Table 3.
Synopsis
Patients with AF have an increased risk of stroke that 
varies widely among individuals. Several risk scores 
based on clinical factors have been developed.1–3 Risk 
scores should be evaluated using accepted criteria11: 
their ability to discriminate between high- and low-risk 
individuals (eg, as assessed by the c-index), their accu-
rate calibration to actual risk levels, and their validation 
in independent populations. A patient’s absolute risk of 
stroke is central to recommendations about anticoagu-
lation and can be characterized as low (∼ <1%/y), inter-
mediate (∼ 1 to ∼ 2%/y), and high (∼ >2%/y). Currently 
used risk scores discriminate moderately well between 
patients at higher and lower risk yet can greatly overes-timate or underestimate absolute risk levels4 in differ-
ent populations. Current risk scores may be inaccurate 
because they omit other factors that alter risk of stroke, 
especially characteristics of AF12–14; consequently, risk 
scores should be calibrated against the actual annual 
rates of stroke in the target population to assure an ac-
curate, unbiased risk prediction. Newer risk scores may 
modestly improve risk discrimination (c-index) compared 
with CHA2DS2-VASc and may offer potential advantag-
es in specific populations (Table 8). Online calculators 
are available for the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk 
Factors in Atrial Fibrillation),1 CHA2DS2-VASc,2 and 
GARFIELD-AF3 (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the 
Field-Atrial Fibrillation) risk scores.
Anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so 
patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding 
risk as part of SDM about anticoagulation. Currently 
used bleeding risk scores—HAS-BLED (hypertension, 
abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or 
predisposition, labile international normalized ratio [INR], 
elderly [age ≥65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly]),5 
HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic or renal disease, etha-
nol abuse, malignancy, older age [≥75 years], reduced 
platelet count or function, re-bleeding risk, hypertension 
[uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, 
stroke),6 and ATRIA (anemia, renal disease, elderly [age 
≥75 years], any prior bleeding, hypertension)7—discrimi-
nate poorly between patients with and without bleed-
ing15 and include many nonspecific factors that predict 
an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of 
bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and previ-
ous stroke). Assessment of factors that specifically pre-
dict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an 
increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing 
risks and benefits of anticoagulation.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Several risk scores based on clinical factors have 
been developed1–3; in general, risk discrimina-
tion is improved by including more predictors (eg, 
CHA2DS2-VASc improved on the original CHADS22 
[congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 
years, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemia attack/
thromboembolism] by adding additional risk fac-
tors and age categories). However, the absolute 
risk associated with any particular score level var-
ies widely across populations; among 15 cohort 
studies, patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 
had annual rates of stroke that ranged from low to 
high: <1% in 4 cohorts, 1% to 2% in 6 cohorts, and 
>2% in 5 cohorts,4 although higher scores were 
associated with higher stroke risk in each cohort 
(Figure 9). The CHA2DS2-VASc score is consid-
ered the most validated score, most therapies 
have used that score to prove efficacy, and thus 
CHA2DS2-VASc is generally the preferred score.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationY et, despite its extensive use, CHA2DS2-VASc has 
shown suboptimal performance in selected popu-
lations, such as those with renal disease, prompt-
ing the creation of other scores. Newer risk scores, 
such as the ATRIA1,16,17 and GARFIELD-AF3,18 
scores, modestly improve risk discrimination 
(c-index) compared with CHA2DS2-VASc, but their 
calibration and risk reclassification performance 
has not been as rigorously evaluated. A recent 
meta-analysis reported that 19 risk scores, 329 
external validations, and 76 risk score updates 
have been conducted to predict ischemic stroke 
in patients with AF.19 Potential differences of the 
most studied risk scores are listed in Table 9. Some 
potential advantages of other scores, for example, 
the GARFIELD-AF score, includes mortality and 
bleeding risk to facilitate discussion with patients 
in a more comprehensive way. Also, when uncer-
tainty exists, a score such as GARFIELD-AF adds 
additional variables to consider, such as smoking 
status, renal disease, and dementia. This guideline 
does not intend to preclude the future development 
of more accurate scores for stratifying patients. 2. Clinical decisions surrounding stroke prevention 
therapy in patients with AF must balance the risks 
of ischemic stroke, the risks of bleeding with treat-
ment, net clinical benefit, and patient preferences. 
The most studied bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED,5 
HEMORR2HAGES,6 and ATRIA7) discriminate 
poorly between patients with and without bleeding20 
(c-index 0.58 to 0.59 in a French nationwide study21). 
These scores are problematic to use in clinical deci-
sion-making because they incorporate several clini-
cal factors that increase the risks of both stroke and 
bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and 
previous stroke), which makes it difficult to balance 
the benefits and risks of anticoagulation because the 
same risk factors also predict higher risk of stroke. 
Consideration of factors that specifically indicate a 
higher risk of bleeding without predicting higher risk 
of stroke (eg, previous bleeding, anemia, and certain 
medications) may better inform decision-making 
about the balance of benefits and harms expected 
from anticoagulation. Assessment of risk factors 
specific for bleeding may suggest interventions to 
reduce bleeding risk, such as discontinuing antiplate-
let medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications or the use of LAAO devices.10
 3. The decision to treat with OACs for stroke pre-
vention in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc of 1 
(CHA2DS2-VASc of 2 in women) may at times 
require additional discussion with patients as the 
strength or recommendation is less robust (2a), and 
often patients might be more reluctant. Also, the 
1-point-concept of risk estimation in the subgroup 
of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 has 
shown to be simplistic because the magnitude of 
risk for each factor is heterogeneous and because 
data have shown a wide range of risk depending on 
the studied cohort.22 Thus, as part of SDM discus-
sions with patients, other factors, such as AF bur-
den, can be considered when interpreting a stroke 
risk score.12–14, 23 Additional factors, such as degree 
of hypertension control, can also affect the risk of 
stroke; in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction 
in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in 
Atrial Fibrillation) trial, a single elevated BP mea-
surement during the study was associated with a 
50% increased risk of stroke.23,24 Additional patient-
specific risk factors, such as certain biomarkers (eg, 
proBNP), LA or left atrial appendage (LAA) func-
tion and anatomy, or electrocardiographic features, 
among others, have been demonstrated to influence 
stroke risk, yet it is unclear how to incorporate them 
into clinical practice.12 Antithrombotic treatment 
with DOACs seems to offer a superior net-benefit 
with regard to prevention of thromboembolic events 
and the risk of major bleeding compared with vita-
min K antagonists (VKAs). Consideration of these Table 8. Three Validated Risk Models for Stroke

 4. Unless an absolute contraindication to antico-

the most commonly used scores (HAS-BLED,5 
HEMORR2HAGES,6 and ATRIA7) are based on 
several clinical factors that indicate higher risks of 
both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher 
risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of 
stroke. Furthermore, a bleeding risk score can-
not be interpreted in isolation because it does not 
assess the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation 
or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of 
stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the 
benefits of stroke prevention with oral anticoagula-
tion generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even 
in patients determined to be at high risk for bleed-
ing.8,9 Decision-making about oral anticoagulation 
should be based on consideration of both benefits and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in iso-
lation, and the best utility of these scores may be 
identifying potential modifying risk factors.8,9

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSynopsis
Prevention of stroke is important in patients with AF to 
maximize survival, health, and QOL. Selection of stroke 
risk reduction therapy should be guided by the patient’s 
risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and their 
individual preferences. When considering stroke preven-
tion therapy, the risk of stroke should inform the decision 
regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, 
long-standing persistent, or permanent). All decisions re-
garding stroke prevention therapy should be periodically 
reassessed since a patient’s risk, eligibility, and prefer-
ences can change over time.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Although the risk of stroke and systemic embolism 
and all-cause mortality are increased in persons with 
more persistent forms of AF, selection of stroke pre-
vention therapy should be based on the risk of stroke 
and not the pattern of AF. Treatment effects with oral 
anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns 
(paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or 
permanent) in trials of stroke prevention therapy.1–3
 2. AF is a lifelong condition and, thus, patient char-
acteristics, risk factors, and net clinical benefit 
can and often will change over time.4 In long-term 
follow-up, stroke risk increases due to age and accumulation of other risk factors.6 Physiologic 
factors that impact stroke prevention therapy also 
change over time and can have important impli-
cations for proper medication dosing and patient 
safety.5 T ypically, periodic assessment should be 
performed once a year but might need to be per-
formed more frequently in the context of changes 
in clinical status, such as reduction in renal function 
or development of additional risk factors.
6.3. Oral Anticoagulants
Vitamin K Antagonists
Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line ther-
apy until DOACs came into practice. A narrow thera-
peutic window based on international normalized ratios 
(INRs), frequent monitoring, more frequent drug inter-
actions (mainly through CYP2C9), dietary restrictions,  
and low clinical safety profile affected the routine 
use of warfarin in practice. Because of affordability 
issues of DOACs for some patients with AF, warfa-
rin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost 
for patients who cannot afford DOACs. About 21% of 
patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving war-
farin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quar-
ter of 2017 .1 Warfarin remains the first-line therapy in  Table 9. Some Best Known Published Clinical Scores With Potential Advantages

therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate

rivaroxaban) with warfarin showed superiority or noninfe-
riority to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic 
embolism in patients with AF except for moderate to se-
vere mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve.2–5 They also 
showed significantly lower risks of major bleeding in the

significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) 
compared with warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks 
were significantly higher in the dabigatran 150 mg twice 
daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban groups 
compared with the warfarin group. However, the apixaban 
group did not significantly increase the risk of gastrointes-
tinal bleeding compared with the warfarin group.

COR LOE Recommendations 
1 A 1. For patients with AF and an estimated annual 
thromboembolic risk of ≥2% per year (eg, 
CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2 in men and ≥3 in 
women), anticoagulation is recommended to  
prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism.1–7
1 A 2. In patients with AF who do not have a history of 
moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or 
a mechanical heart valve, and who are candidates 
for anticoagulation, DOACs are recommended over

risk.1–4 Patients at intermediate risk (1%-2%/y) can 
also benefit from anticoagulation, and the RE-L Y1 and 
ARISTOTLE3 trials included this population. Stroke risk 
scores applied to cohorts give different stroke rates, 
and therefore any score should be viewed as only an 
estimate of true risk; in addition some scores used 
stroke, while others used thromboembolic events. 
Nonetheless, it is practical to use a validated risk score, 
such as CHA2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, or GARFIELD-AF. Fu-
ture research may yield improved risk scores that refine 
how to incorporate risk modifiers, such as female sex12 
and other parameters such as AF burden. Anticoagula-
tion has also been shown to be superior to antiplatelet 
therapy to reduce stroke risk.8,9 Recommendations for antithrombotic selection in valvular heart disease (VHD) 
are provided in Section 6.8.5 (“AF in VHD”) and for 
AFL in Section 6.8.6 ( Figure 10).

 1. Randomized trials published in the 1990s estab-
lished the superiority of anticoagulation, at that 
time limited to warfarin, to reduce stroke.11 Since 
that time, management has advanced considerably, 
and the randomized trials that compared DOACs 
with warfarin1–4 are more relevant to current anti-
thrombotic management. In these trials1–4 and 
metanalyses,5–7 DOACs were favored for lower risk 
of stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH.1–7 These 
trials reported the CHADS2 score. The recently 
studied ATRIA and Swedish cohorts13,14 reported 
lower stroke rates, by CHADS2 score, compared 
with that previously reported.15 A CHADS2 score 
of 1 gave a stroke rate of 1.20 in ATRIA14 and 
2.4 in a Swedish cohort.13 A CHADS2 score of 2 Table 12. Thromboembolic Event Rates by Point Score for ATRIA, CHADS2, and CHA2DS2-VASc Risk Scores*

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationgave a stroke rate of 2.59 in ATRIA14 and 3.5 in 
the Swedish cohort.13 Therefore, the stroke risk 
of patients in the rivaroxaban2 and edoxaban4 
trials was likely >2% given a required minimum 
CHADS2 score of 2, and lower in the apixaban3 
and dabigatran1 trials that included scores of 0 
and 1. A Markov state transition decision model16 
concluded that anticoagulation was preferred for 
a stroke rate of 1.7%. Therefore, a stroke and sys-
temic embolism risk threshold of 2% is likely to 
yield a benefit that far exceeds risk. In some con-
ditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the 
risk of stroke is high enough independent of risk 
score to indicate anticoagulation.17
 2. In the randomized DOAC trials, all DOACs 
achieved noninferiority1–4 and in 2 trials (for dabi-
gatran, RE-L Y, and for apixaban, ARISTOTLE) 
were superior to warfarin. With warfarin, regular 
assessment of the INR is necessary to maintain 
a therapeutic value. In the RCTs, the mean time in 
therapeutic range was only 55% in ROCKET AF2 
and highest at 66% in ARISTOTLE.3 In a meta-
analysis,6 DOACs, compared with warfarin, had a 
relative risk of stroke of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91; 
P<0.0001), a relative risk of mortality of 0.90 
(95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P =0.0003), relative risk of 
ICH of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.59; P <0.0001), and 
increased relative risk of bleeding of 1.25 (95% 
CI, 1.01-1.55; P=0.043). Although patients with 
moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechani-
cal valve were excluded from DOAC trials (and subsequently shown they may have worse out-
comes with DOACS), other forms of VHD were 
allowed, such as aortic stenosis or regurgitation or 
mitral regurgitation. Bioprosthetic valves and valve 
repair were allowed in the edoxaban (ENGAGE 
AF) and apixaban (ARISTOTLE) trials, and valve 
repair in the rivaroxaban (ROCKET AF) trial. A sys-
tematic review18 of patients with VHD (other than 
mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) concluded 
that DOACs were safe.
 3. As the DOAC trials1–4 demonstrated improved 
safety compared with warfarin, the threshold 
of using a DOAC might be different than for 
warfarin.16 A Markov decision model found the 
tipping point for warfarin to be at 1.7%/year 
stroke risk.16 Considering the improved ICH and 
mortality risk of DOACs compared with warfa-
rin in meta-analyses of the DOAC trials,5–7 it 
is appropriate to designate a lower stroke risk 
threshold if a DOAC is utilized. The dabigatran1 
and apixaban3 trials included lower risk patients 
and about one-third of patients had a CHADS2 
score of 0 or 1. This likely corresponds to an 
estimated annual stroke risk of about 1%, con-
sidering more recent cohorts.13,14 This is further 
supported by meta-analyses that showed a con-
sistent benefit of DOACs across a broad range 
of vulnerable patients, including as classified by 
CHADS2 scores.6,7
 4. A meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and 
early 2000s found that while antiplatelet ther-
apy (APT), most commonly aspirin, reduced 
stroke and systemic embolism compared with 
placebo, APT was inferior to warfarin in patients 
with AF.11 Aspirin was studied compared to 
apixaban in the AVERROES trial (Apixaban 
Versus ASA to Prevent Stroke In AF Patients 
Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin 
K Antagonist Treatment)9 for patients unsuit-
able for VKAs; this trial was stopped early due 
to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin to pre-
vent stroke or systemic embolism, while major 
bleeding was similar between the 2 arms. The 
combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was com-
pared to VKAs in ACTIVEW (Atrial fibrillation 
Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention 
of Vascular Events),8 and this trial was stopped 
prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagu-
lation with VKAs to prevent stroke, non–central 
nervous system systemic embolus, MI, or vas-
cular death. Unless there is an indication for 
antiplatelet therapy, such as coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) or vascular disease, patients with 
AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy 
to reduce stroke risk.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 5. Aspirin therapy was compared with no treatment in 
patients with low stroke risk in a multicenter RCT 
in Japan, the Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial.10 
This trial was stopped early when an interim analysis 
showed that aspirin gave a marginally higher risk of 
major bleeding and was unlikely to prevent primary 
or secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was 
noncardiovascular death, ICH, major bleeding, and 
peripheral embolization. A meta-analysis of 7 trials 
that studied aspirin versus placebo found that aspirin 
reduced stroke by 19%, which did not reach statisti-
cal significance with a CI that included 0 (–1% to 
35%). Four of these were primary prevention trials 
and showed an absolute risk reduction with aspirin 
of 0.8% per year, with a number needed to treat 
of 125.11 Although aspirin has not been studied in 
patients without any risk factors for stroke, patients 
without stroke risk may derive no benefit from aspi-
rin therapy. In fact, 1 study that analyzed stroke 
mechanisms in the SPAF (Stroke Prevention in Atrial 
Fibrillation) I-III trials demonstrated that aspirin did 
not decrease the rate of cardioembolic stroke and 
that AF patients at highest risk for stroke are those 
with the highest rates of cardioembolic stroke and 
have the greatest reduction in stroke with anticoagu-
lants.19 Thus, modest reduction in stroke observed in 
some trials may have been related to noncardioem-
bolic stroke in patients with additional risk factors.

Recommendations for Considerations in Managing Anticoagulants
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 C-LD 1. For patients with AF receiving DOACs, optimal man-
agement of drug interactions is recommended for 
those receiving concomitant therapy with interacting 
drugs, especially CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein 
inhibitors or inducers (Table 13).1–7
1 B-R 2. For patients with AF receiving warfarin,* a target INR 
between 2 and 3 is recommended, as well as optimal 
management of drug-drug interactions, consistency in 
vitamin K dietary intake, and routine INR monitoring 
to improve time in therapeutic range and to minimize 
risks of preventable thromboembolism or major bleed-
ing.8–10
3: 
HarmB-NR 3. For patients with AF, nonevidence-based doses of 
DOACs should be avoided to minimize risks of pre-
ventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to 
improve survival.11,12
*Excludes patients with mechanical valves.
Synopsis
Multiple factors need to be considered to select an 
optimal OAC in patients with AF. Efficacy, safety, in-
surance coverage, renal/hepatic function, drug inter-
action screening, medication adherence, and patient 
preferences are the major factors for consideration. Dosing of DOACs in patients with AF should be se-
lected based on age, renal function, weight, and con-
comitant medications. The hepatic function also needs 
to be evaluated for the appropriateness of DOACs. 
Characteristics and dosing of OACs are summarized 
in Table 13. Although DOAC drug interactions occur 
in practice less frequently than with warfarin, clinically 
significant drug interactions through CYP3A4 and/or 
p-glycoprotein should be carefully evaluated. Strong 
CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors such as ke-
toconazole, itraconazole, and ritonavir may significantly 
increase DOAC plasma levels and the risk of bleeding, 
while strong CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inducers 
such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, 
carbamazepine, or St. John’s wort may lower DOAC 
plasma levels and increase the risks of stroke or sys-
temic embolism. The routine measurement of DOAC 
plasma concentrations is not indicated in practice due 
to the lack of well-established therapeutic ranges in 
the literature. DOAC levels may be indicated when cli-
nicians assess DOAC adherence for potentially non-
compliant patients, quantify residual anticoagulation 
levels before emergency invasive procedures/surger-
ies, or evaluate the absorption of DOAC after bariatric 
surgery. Regular monitoring is recommended to opti-
mize indications, ensure appropriate dosing, and avoid 
adverse effects. Suggested laboratory monitoring is 
summarized in Figure 11.
If warfarin is selected over DOACs, achievement of 
higher time in therapeutic range (eg, ≥70%), and thor-
ough consideration of drug-drug interactions, vitamin K 
food intake advice, and patient education on adherence 
to dosing instructions are important to reduce adverse 
effects.

 1. Rivaroxaban is contraindicated for patients receiving 
ketoconazole or ritonavir, because ketoconazole or

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationsubreference DOAC levels was significantly higher 
in patients receiving antiepileptic drugs compared 
to those not receiving any CYP3A4 inducers.4 The 
claim-based retrospective cohort study showed 
that CYP-inducing antiepileptic drug use was sig-
nificantly associated with an 86% increase in throm-
boembolic and ischemic adverse events in patients 
receiving DOACs.6 A prospective multicenter cohort 
study corroborated that the patients receiving con-
comitant therapy of DOACs and antiepileptic drugs 
developed a higher rate of stroke/TIA/systemic 
embolism (5.7% patient-year).7
 2. Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients 
with AF receiving CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein–induc-
ing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or 
mechanical heart valve. Also, warfarin may be selected 
over DOACs in patients with AF due to higher cost or 
intolerances of DOACs. The optimal INR control, with 
a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved 
through the appropriate drug-drug interaction man-
agement, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR 
monitoring. A systematic review of 47 studies found 
that time in therapeutic INR range showed negative 
correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, –0.59; 
P=0.01) and major bleeding (R, –0.59; P=0.002).8 
An RCT revealed that a weekly vitamin K dietary 
modification significantly achieved a therapeutic INR 
more frequently than a conventional group (74 ver-
sus 58%; P=0.04) at 90 days after randomization.9 
A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs and 61 observational 
studies for warfarin drug interactions found that the 
concomitant use of APT (odds ratio [OR], 1.74 [95% 
CI, 1.56-1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29-2.59]), selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42-1.85]), or 
antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45-1.83]) 
was significantly associated with higher risks of clini-
cally relevant bleeding.10 3. A significant number of patients with nonvalvu-
lar AF are receiving DOAC off-label doses not 
compliant with labeling.15–18 A meta-analysis of 
cohort studies showed that inappropriately lower 
DOAC doses are significantly associated with 
higher stroke or systemic embolism risks com-
pared with the standard labeled doses (OR, 1.21 
[95% CI, 1.02-1.43]; P =0.03), but no significant 
differences in bleeding risks were observed (OR, 
1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.15]; P =0.62).11 Of note, 9 
of 16 included studies were performed in Asia, 
while 4 studies in the United States, 2 studies 
in Europe, and 1 worldwide study were included. 
Another meta-analysis of observational studies 
found that inappropriately higher DOAC doses 
were significantly associated with higher risks 
of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.26 [95% CI, 1.11-1.43]; P =0.003) 
or major bleeding (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.04-1.62]; 
P=0.025) compared with the standard doses.12 In 
this study, underdosing was also associated with a 
higher risk of net clinical outcome (HR, 1.19 [95% 
CI, 1.04-1.40]; P =0.04) and all-cause death (HR, 
1.24 [95% CI, 1.04-1.48]; P =0.02). Off-label dos-
ing should be avoided to optimize the efficacy and 
safety of DOACs.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSynopsis
Approximately 25% to 30% of ischemic strokes re-
main cryptogenic after standard stroke evaluation.2,3 
A large proportion of these events are presumed to 
be related to occult AF, particularly those of embolic 
appearance.4,5 APT is the recommended treatment of 
choice for patients with cryptogenic stroke, including 
embolic stroke of undetermined source.6,7 For patients 
with AF in general, however, anticoagulation has been 
shown to be superior to APT for stroke risk reduction.8 
Thus, detection of occult AF after stroke may have 
significant therapeutic implications. Randomized tri-
als have shown longer durations of cardiac monitoring 
result in higher rates of AF detection after stroke.1,9,10 
However, data are limited regarding the effects of 
extended monitoring on risk reduction of recurrent 
stroke or poststroke mortality. For recommendations 
on anticoagulation and risk factors, refer to Section 
6.4.1 (“Oral Anticoagulants”).

 1. Growing evidence supports the use of extended 
cardiac monitoring for the identification of occult 
AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke.11,12 In 
the EMBRACE (30 Day Event Monitoring Belt 
for Recording Atrial Fibrillation After a Cerebral 
Ischemic Event) trial, which randomized 572 
patients ≥55 years of age with recent crypto-
genic stroke or TIA to either 30-day external 
loop recorder or conventional 24-hour Holter 
monitoring, extended monitoring was associ-
ated with higher rates of AF detection at 90 
days.1The CRYSTAL-AF (Cryptogenic Stroke and 
Underlying AF) trial randomized 441 patients ≥ 40 
years of age with recent cryptogenic stroke or 
TIA to cardiac monitoring with either insertable 
loop recorder or conventional follow-up ECGs. 
Implantable recorder was superior in detecting 
AF at 6 months (8.9% versus 1.4%), 12 months 
(12.4% versus 2.0%), and 3 years (30% versus 
3%).9 In FIND-AF (Future Innovations in Novel 
Detection of Atrial Fibrillation), which compared 
repeated sets of 10-day Holter monitoring (at 
baseline, 3-month, and 6-month timepoints) to 
conventional 24-Holter in patients ≥ 60 years of 
age with recent stroke, higher rates of detection 
were associated with repeated monitoring (14% 
versus 5%; absolute difference, 9.0% [95% CI, 
3.4-14.5]; P=0.002).10 Finally, the PER DIEM 
(Post-Embolic Rhythm Detection with Implantable 
vs External Monitoring) RCT also showed a sig-
nificantly greater proportion of patients with 
AF detected at 1 year with prolonged monitor-
ing.13 Additional studies are needed, however, to 
determine whether extended cardiac monitoring 
improves long-term poststroke outcomes.6.4.1. Oral Anticoagulation for Device-Detected 
Atrial High-Rate Episodes Among Patients Without 
a Previous Diagnosis of AF
Recommendations for Oral Anticoagulation for Device-Detected Atrial 
High-Rate Episodes Among Patients Without a Previous Diagnosis of AF
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
2a B-NR 1. For patients with a device-detected atrial high-rate 
episode (AHRE) lasting ≥ 24 hours1 and with a 
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent stroke risk,2  
it is reasonable to initiate oral anticoagulation3  
within a SDM framework that considers episode 
duration and individual patient risk.
2b B-NR 2. For patients with a device-detected AHRE last-
ing between 5 minutes and 24 hours and with a 
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3 or equivalent stroke risk,2 
it may be reasonable to initiate anticoagulation 
within a SDM framework that considers episode 
duration and individual patient risk.
3: No 
BenefitB-NR 3. Patients with a device-detected AHRE lasting  
<5 minutes and without another indication for  
oral anticoagulation should not receive oral  
anticoagulation.4,5
Synopsis
AHREs detected by a cardiovascular implantable elec-
tronic device are associated with a stroke risk lower than 
that of clinical AF6 that varies according to the episode 
duration1 and CHA2DS2-VASc score.2 Clinician confir-
mation of the duration and nature of the longest atrial 
high-rate episode is recommended.1 Episodes lasting 
≥24 hours are associated with a significant risk of stroke 
or systemic embolism1,7 that may be reduced with oral 
anticoagulation.3 By contrast, short episodes, commonly 
defined as <5 minutes, are not associated with clinical 
events.4,5 Patients with episodes of intermediate duration 
and with an elevated stroke risk may benefit from oral 
anticoagulation.2 There is an interaction between AHRE 
duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score,2 suggesting both 
may be used to guide oral anticoagulation candidacy 
(Figure 12). Of note, the threshold for anticoagulation is 
higher as in device-detected AF the risk of stroke may be 
lower than in clinical AF.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationwere not adjudicated,7 though clinician confirma-
tion is preferred. In an observational study linking 
administrative claims data2 to a device database 
in which continuous rhythm monitoring data were 
available but not adjudicated, the risk of stroke 
among patents with subclinical AF >23.5 hours 
and a sex-modified CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 not 
taking anticoagulation exceeded 1% per year, a 
threshold that may be appropriate for use of non-
VKAs, with a still higher stroke risk with increas-
ing CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3.8 In a retrospective cohort study of patients with subclinical AF >24 
hours with an average CHA2DS2-VASc score of 
4.2±1.4, treatment of subclinical AF >24 hours 
with OAC was associated with a reduced stroke 
risk (HR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.10-0.81]; P =0.02).2,3
 2. Although the risk of stroke among patients with 
an AHRE of intermediate duration is lower than 
that among patients with an AHRE ≥24 hours, 
the precise stroke risk is uncertain and may 
vary according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score. In 
ASSERT, AHREs lasting >6 minutes to 24 hours

A potential approach to patients with SCAF could consider both patient risk (as gauged by the CHA2DS2-VASc score) and SCAF burden/duration. 
Circle A indicates patients at low risk or with short and infrequent AHREs do not require anticoagulation; Circle B, patients with intermediate risk and 
AHREs lasting >6 min to 24 h are an uncertain population but are currently under study in 2 prospective randomized controlled trials; and Circle C, 
patients at high risk with longer episodes could be considered reasonable candidates for anticoagulation, although the precise threshold for SCAF

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationwere not associated with stroke or systemic embo-
lism compared with patients without AHREs.1 The 
CHA2DS2-VASc score of this subpopulation was 
2.2±1.0 (mean±SD). In the aforementioned study 
linking administrative claims data to a device data-
base in which continuous rhythm monitoring data 
were available, the risk of stroke and systemic 
embolism off anticoagulation exceeded 1% among 
patients with a sex-modified CHA2DS2-VASc score 
of 3 to 4 and exceeded 2% among patients with a 
sex-modified CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥5.2
 3. Brief episodes of subclinical AF are at low risk of clin-
ical events. In RATE (Registry of Atrial Tachycardia 
and Atrial Fibrillation), patients with clinical events 
such as hospitalization, death, or stroke were more 
likely than those without to have AHREs with either 
onset or offset of an adjudicated, single ECG (31.9% 
versus 22.1% among patients with pacemakers and 
28.7% and 20.2% among patients with implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]).4 AHREs >5 min-
utes are highly correlated with AF and AFL, whereas 
shorter episodes often represent other tachyar-
rhythmias.9 To remove most episodes of oversens-
ing, AHREs lasting ≤ 5 minutes were excluded from 
analysis of MOST (Mode Selection Trial).10 A similar 
threshold was used in several subsequent key stud-
ies to exclude spurious events.1,3,5,11,12
6.5. Nonpharmacological Stroke Prevention
Although oral anticoagulation is the standard of care to 
reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF, it 
is contraindicated in some patients due to an excess risk 
of major bleeding. Surgical and percutaneous techniques 
to occlude the LAA have been developed to reduce the 
risk of ischemic stroke. These techniques have the po-
tential to obviate the need for or supplement long-term 
oral anticoagulation in select patients. Surgical LAAO is 
a particularly important consideration in patients with AF 
who undergo cardiac surgery.
6.5.1. Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA
Recommendations for Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
2a B-NR 1. In patients with AF, a moderate to high risk of stroke 
(CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2), and a contraindication 
(Table 14) to long-term oral anticoagulation due to a 
nonreversible cause, percutaneous LAAO (pLAAO) is 
reasonable.1–4
2b B-R 2. In patients with AF and a moderate to high risk of 
stroke and a high risk of major bleeding on oral anti-
coagulation, pLAAO may be a reasonable alternative 
to oral anticoagulation based on patient preference, 
with careful consideration of procedural risk and with 
the understanding that the evidence for oral antico-
agulation is more extensive.1–3,5,6Synopsis
A large body of evidence supports the use of OACs 
to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with 
AF; however, OACs may be contraindicated in some 
patients (Table 14). pLAAO devices are designed to 
prevent embolization of LAA thrombi and potentially 
obviate the need for OAC for stroke risk reduction. 
RCTs have demonstrated pLAAO to be noninferior to 
warfarin and DOACs for stroke and systemic embolism 
with a reduced risk of major bleeding.1–4 A prospective 
nonrandomized study has shown that patients deemed 
unsuitable for OAC who undergo pLAAO implant have 
a lower-than-expected risk of ischemic stroke.5 Pro-
spective registries of pLAAO device implant in pa-
tients who are not on long-term OAC have shown a 
high rate of procedural success, a low risk of major 
procedure-related complications, and a low rate of 
ischemic stroke in follow-up.6,7 Based on these find-
ings, pLAAO is reasonable in patients with nonvalvular 
AF who have a contraindication to long-term OAC due 
to a nonreversible cause. Additionally, pLAAO may be 
reasonable as an alternative to OAC based on patient 
preference after careful consideration of procedural 
risk and with the understanding that there is a much 
greater body of evidence supporting OAC in this popu-
lation in general.

 1. pLAAO has been evaluated in patients with AF 
and a contraindication to OAC. The ASAP (ASA 
Plavix Feasibility Study With Watchman Left Atrial 
Appendage Closure Technology) study was a non-
randomized trial evaluating the performance of the 
Watchman device in 150 patients with AF who 
were deemed ineligible for OAC with warfarin.5 
The rate of ischemic stroke was lower in patients 
who received the Watchman device than would 
be expected based on the CHADS2 scores of 
the cohort (2.3% versus 7 .3%). The EWOLUTION 
(Evaluating Real-Life Clinical Outcomes in Atrial 
Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN

spective registry showed a high rate of Watchman 
device procedural success (98.5%) with a low

procedurally.6 The PINNACLE FLX (Protection

 2. PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage 
System for Embolic Protection in Patients With 
Atrial Fibrillation) was a noninferiority RCT com-
paring pLAAO with the Watchman device with 
warfarin in patients with AF at an increased risk 
for stroke. pLAAO was noninferior to warfarin 
for both primary composite efficacy (stroke, sys-
temic embolism, and cardiovascular/unexplained 
death) and safety (procedure-related events and 
major bleeding) endpoints.1 pLAAO was superior 
to warfarin in terms of cardiovascular mortality 
(HR, 0.40, 95% CI, 0.21-0.75; P =0.005) and all-
cause mortality (HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.45-0.98; 
P=0.004). The PREVAIL (Watchman Left Atrial 
Appendage Closure Device in Patients With 
Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin 
Therapy) study was a follow-up RCT that com-
pared the Watchman device with warfarin in 
a similar patient population.2 pLAAO did not 
achieve noninferiority for the first primary com-
posite efficacy endpoint (stroke, systemic embo-
lism, and cardiovascular/unexplained death) 
but was limited in statistical power because of 
unexpectedly low event rates. pLAAO was sta-
tistically noninferior to warfarin for nonproce-
dure-related strokes. Higher implant success 
and lower procedure-related safety event rates 
were observed in PREVAIL than PROTECT AF. 
A 5-year patient-level meta-analysis of these tri-
als demonstrated similar efficacy of pLAAO for stroke prevention and reduced rates of major 
bleeding compared with warfarin.3 PRAGUE-17 
(Left Atrial Appendage Closure vs Novel 
Anticoagulation Agents in Atrial Fibrillation) was 
an RCT that compared pLAAO with DOACs in 
patients with nonvalvular AF.4 pLAAO was non-
inferior to DOACs for the combined safety and 
efficacy composite endpoint (stroke, TIA, sys-
temic embolism, cardiovascular death, major or 
nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding, or proce-
dure-/device-related complications).

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 A 1. In patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery with 
a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 or equivalent stroke risk, 
surgical LAA exclusion, in addition to continued anti-
coagulation, is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke 
and systemic embolism.1–3
1 A 2. In patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery and 
LAA exclusion, a surgical technique resulting in 
absence of flow across the suture line and a stump  
of <1 cm as determined by intraoperative trans-
esophageal echocardiography should be used.1,4,5
2b A 3. In patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery 
with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent stroke 
risk, the benefit of surgical LAA exclusion in the 
absence of continued anticoagulation to reduce  
the risk of stroke and systemic embolism is  
uncertain.1–3
Synopsis
Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (S-LAAO) for 
reduction in the risk of recurrent arterial thromboemboli 
was first reported in 1949.6 After decades of relative 
clinical equipoise,7,8 accumulating evidence,2,8–10 culmi-
nating in the large RCT LAAOS III (Left Atrial Append-
age Occlusion Study),1 supports a benefit of S-LAAO 
in patients with AF who undergo2,9 coronary artery by-
pass graft surgery (CABG) or valve surgeries. A 2019 
meta-analysis before the publication of LAAOS III re-
viewed 22 studies, including 280 585 patients of whom 
36 686 underwent S-LAAO during cardiac surgery. S-
LAAO showed an association with a 29% lower risk 
of stroke or thromboembolism. The all-cause mortality 
rate at 2 years was lower in patients who underwent S-
LAAO. No benefit was found in the subgroup of studies 
that included patients without preoperative AF.9 These 
favorable findings were validated by the 4770-subject 
LAAOS III, which confirmed S-LAAO in addition to OAC 
provides a 33% reduction in risk of stroke and systemic 
embolism.1
LAAOS III enrolled only patients with preexisting AF; 
evidence of the effectiveness of S-LAAO in patients 
without AF is inconsistent and suggests the benefit of Table 14. Situations in Which Long-Term Anticoagulation

tion are awaited.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. LAAOS III was performed with 4770 patients with 
AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 undergoing 
cardiac surgery randomized to S-LAAO or no 
S-LAAO. Intraoperative transesophageal echo-
cardiogram (TEE) was recommended to assess 
successful closure using an endorsed technique. 
Oral anticoagulation was continued postopera-
tively. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the 
primary endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism 
occurred in 4.8% of the S-LAAO group and 7 .0% 
of the no S-LAAO group (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 
0.53-0.85]; P=0.001). Mortality rate, cross-clamp 
and bypass time, chest tube output, and bleed-
ing were not different between groups. More than 
75% of subjects in both groups received OAC. 
These data indicate S-LAAO provides additional 
benefit to oral anticoagulation without increasing 
risk of adverse events.
   These findings cannot be extrapolated to 
patients without AF or patients who are not can-
didates for OAC. Most subjects underwent CABG 
or valve surgery, and the mean CHA2DS2-VASc 
score was 4.2. Surgical AF ablation was performed 
in one-third of both groups. Patients undergoing 
mechanical valve surgery, transplant, off-pump 
bypass, left ventricular assistive device surgery, 
and congenital heart disease (CHD) cases were 
excluded.A subsequent meta-analysis of 5 RCTs 
and 22 observational studies including 540 111 
patients showed a significant decrease in stroke 
and thromboembolism with S-LAAO.11 The postop-
erative mortality rate did not differ but, in follow-up, 
was reduced in the S-LAAO group after 2 years. 
No difference in major bleeding, all-cause rehospi-
talizations, or cross-clamp time was observed.11
 2. Substantial heterogeneity in S-LAAO methods 
exists in the literature, and not all techniques 
effectively exclude the LAA.4 An increased risk 
of stroke and thromboembolism is associated 
with incomplete S-LAAO5,12; however, many stud-
ies do not report assessment of occlusion suc-
cess.9 This inconsistency has likely contributed 
to the variability in outcome.7,9 LAAOS III permit-
ted 4 techniques: amputation and closure (which 
was promoted as the preferred technique), used 
in 56%; stapler closure, used in 11%; double-
layer linear closure (if confirmed by TEE), used 
in 14%; or an approved LAAO device, used in 
15%. Other techniques were approved on a case-
by-case basis (4%). Intraoperative TEE was rec-
ommended to assess successful closure, defined as absence of flow across the suture line and a 
stump of <1 cm. If the initial closure was unsuc-
cessful, additional suturing was performed for 
repair. Contemporary data show closure success 
of >95% using a surgical clip device.13 In the 
LAAOS series, the mean cross-clamp and bypass 
times were similar, and perioperative bleeding was 
not increased in the S-LAAO group.1,4 These data 
support the importance of complete S-LAAO in 
achieving beneficial outcomes.
 3. In LAAOS III, S-LAAO reduced stroke and throm-
boembolism by 33% in addition to OAC. LAAOS 
III was not designed to resolve whether oral anti-
coagulation can be safely stopped after S-LAAO; 
at hospital discharge, >80% of subjects in both 
groups were receiving OAC, with >75% on OAC 
at the 3-year visit.1 A systematic review and meta-
analysis focusing on the effects of anticoagula-
tion found no statistically significant difference 
in stroke rates of S-LAAO/no S-LAAO subjects 
on OAC versus off OAC, with high heterogene-
ity noted for both ischemic events and mortal-
ity,14 and findings are subject to confounding by 
indication and the potentially beneficial effects 
of surgical AF ablation. The LAACS (Left Atrial 
Appendage Closure with Surgery) study of 187 
subjects undergoing CABG, valve surgery, or 
both who were randomized to S-LAAO versus no 
S-LAAO showed a reduction in the risk of stroke 
in the S-LAAO group, independent of anticoagu-
lation status.15 These results must be interpreted 
with caution, however, because the study was not 
powered to demonstrate a reduction in stroke, and 
substantial crossover occurred.

Synopsis
About 2% to 4% of patients who receive OACs expe-
rience major bleeding and require intervention.13 Acti-
vated charcoal may be administered up to 6 to 8 hours 
after the last dose of an OAC.14,15 Hemodialysis may 
be also considered to eliminate dabigatran but may be 
challenging and impractical due to coagulopathy and 
hemodynamic instability.16 The proportion of emergency 
department visits for bleeding from OACs due to DO -
ACs increased from 2.3% in 2011 to 37 .9% in 2017 
because of the increased use of DOACs over the past 
decade.17 Some patients may require reversal agents 
to achieve rapid hemostasis. Failure to achieve effec-
tive hemostasis is associated with a >3 times higher 
risk of death.18 Idarucizumab for dabigatran-induced 
major bleeding and andexanet alfa for apixaban or ri-
varoxaban associated major bleeding are US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Four-factor PCC 
for DOAC-induced major bleeding was compared with 
andexanet alfa in retrospective cohort studies, but the 
comparison has never been investigated in clinical tri-
als.7 For VKA, if life-threatening bleeding cannot be 
managed with supportive measures, the rapid reversal 
treatment with 4-factor PCC is preferred over fresh fro-
zen plasma.8–10 Table 15 summarizes reversal agents for 
OACs. Table 16 describes bleeding events attributable 
to DOACs in pivotal clinical trials.
Recommendation-Supportive Text
 1. The RE-VERSE AD (Reversal of Dabigatran 
Anticoagulant Effect With Idarucizumab) study was 
a multicenter, prospective cohort study evaluat-
ing the use of idarucizumab in patients receiving 
dabigatran for the management of uncontrolled or 
life-threatening bleeding or in patients requiring 
urgent surgery or invasive procedure.1 In patients 
with uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding, ida-
rucizumab reversed the dabigatran anticoagulation 
effect in 100% of patients, and 67 .7% had bleed-
ing cessation. Thrombosis events after the reversal 
agent use was 4.7% within 30 days. However, this study did not have a control group. The post hoc 
analysis of the RE-VERSE AD study in patients 
with gastrointestinal bleeding found that 97 .5% 
of patients achieved complete reversal of dabiga-
tran, and bleeding cessation occurred in 76.2% of 
patients.2 Another post hoc analysis of the same 
study showed that idarucizumab was effective 
at reversing dabigatran’s anticoagulation effect, 
regardless of baseline renal function.3
 2. Compared with idarucizumab, the data on PCC for 
dabigatran-associated bleeding are very limited. A 
prospective multicenter cohort study compared the 
use of activated PCC in 14 patients with dabiga-
tran-associated major bleeding compared with his-
torical matched cases.4 The study was prematurely 
stopped due to the availability of idarucizumab in 
the market. The effectiveness of activated PCC 
was assessed based on the assessment guide rat-
ing from good, moderate, and poor. Nine patients 
(64%) were rated as good, 5 patients (36%) as 
moderate, and none as poor. No thromboem-
bolic events were found. A randomized, placebo-
controlled crossover trial in 12 healthy subjects 
evaluated the reversal effect of 4-factor PCC 
on rivaroxaban or dabigatran’s effect.5 It showed 
4-factor PCC completely reversed rivaroxaban’s 
effect based the prothrombin time, but it did not 
reverse dabigatran’s effect based on the coagula-
tion tests (aPTT, ecarin clotting time, and thrombin 
time). Four-factor PCC may not be appropriate for 
dabigatran-associated major bleeding manage-
ment until further investigation is performed in 
prospective studies.
 3. The ANNEXA 4 (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel 
Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor 
Xa Inhibitors) trial evaluated the use of andexanet 
alfa in adult patients with acute major bleeding 
(safety population, n=254; efficacy population, 
n=254) receiving factor Xa inhibitors (apixa-
ban 55%, rivaroxaban 36%, edoxaban 3%, and 
enoxaparin 6%).6 It found that after the bolus 
administration, the median anti-factor Xa activity 
decreased by 89%. Twelve hours after the andex-
anet infusion, clinical hemostasis was adjudicated 
as excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients in the 
efficacy analysis (79% [95% CI, 64%-89%]); 
however, thrombotic events occurred in 12 of 
67 patients (18%) during the 30-day follow-up. 
Currently, andexanet alfa is FDA-approved for 
only apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated life-
threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, because 
only limited data are available for other factor 
Xa inhibitors. For 4-factor PCC, a meta-analysis 
of 22 observational studies compared andexanet 
alfa (n=438) with PCC (n=1278) in patients with 
acute bleeding associated with oral factor Xa Recommendations for Active Bleeding on Anticoagulant Therapy and

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation(or intracerebral), subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural 
hemorrhage. In clinical practice, the different forms 
of ICH are often classified by mechanism and most 
broadly as traumatic and nontraumatic or spontaneous 
ICHs (Figure 14). In patients with AF and conditions 
associated with high-risk for thromboembolic compli-
cations (eg, mechanical valve, rheumatic valvular dis-
ease), anticoagulation is often resumed early after ICH, 
regardless of mechanism. For other patients with AF, 
decisions regarding if (and when) to resume antico-
agulation after ICH requires more careful risk-benefit 
assessment of patient-specific clinical factors. Patients 
with traumatic etiologies generally have lower long-
term risk of recurrent hemorrhage, and anticoagulation 
is generally considered safe to resume. Nontraumatic/
spontaneous etiologies (eg, hypertensive parenchymal 
hemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation after isch-emic stroke, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated 
hemorrhage, chronic subdural hemorrhage) are gener-
ally associated with higher risk of recurrence. Clinical 
decision-making regarding the appropriateness of re-
sumption in these patients is based largely on individual 
risk-benefit calculations given the lack of randomized 
data assessing safety and long-term outcomes. For pa-
tients with ICH deemed at high risk of recurrence, LAA 
closure may be a viable alternative to anticoagulation, 
although data on efficacy and safety are lacking in the 
ICH population.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationand position of the prosthetic.9–11 These rates are 
even higher in patients with concurrent AF but are 
significantly reduced with the use of VKAs. Data 
are limited that explore the safety and timing of 
anticoagulation resumption in patients with ICH 
and high-risk valvular disease. In 1 observational 
analysis of 137 patients with ICH and mechani-
cal heart valves, resuming anticoagulation within 
2 weeks from index ICH was associated with 
increased hemorrhagic complications (HR, 7 .06 
[95% CI, 2.33-21.37]).1 However, in balancing the 
risk of hemorrhagic with thrombotic complications, 
the optimal window of resumption was found to be 
between 1 and 2 weeks post-ICH after weighing 
individual patient factors (Table 17).
 2. Anticoagulation is associated with up to 25% of 
ICHs and is associated with worse functional out-
comes and higher mortality.12–15 After ICH, anti-
coagulation is generally held in the acute setting. 
Decisions regarding the appropriateness and 
timing of resumption are complex given the lim-
ited amount of randomized data addressing risks 
and benefits in this population. Previous obser-
vational reports evaluating risk of recurrent ICH, 
thromboembolism, and mortality in patients with 
nonvalvular AF have suggested possible reduc-
tion in thromboembolic risk and mortality with 
resumption of anticoagulation but are limited by 
discordant patient populations and study designs, 
predominant use of VKAs, and potential selection biases.16–22 In a meta-analysis of 2452 patients 
with AF and ICH, resumption of OACs was asso-
ciated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR, 
0.46 [95% CI, 0.29-0.72]) and no difference in 
risk of recurrent ICH compared with patients in 
whom anticoagulation was not resumed2 (Table 
17). However, data are limited on the optimal 
timing for resumption. In an analysis of 2619 
ICH survivors with AF, a composite net benefit 
minimizing risk of bleeding and thromboembolic 
complications occurred when anticoagulation 
was resumed at 7 to 8 weeks after ICH.3 In a 
retrospective study that included 1752 patients 
with OAC-related ICH across 3 Danish registries, 
anticoagulation resumed a median of 34 days 
was associated with an adjusted HR of ischemic 
stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortal-
ity of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39-0.78) compared with 
no anticoagulation.4 In another meta-analysis of 8 
observational studies, resuming OAC was associ-
ated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke without 
increased risk of recurrent ICH at a median time 
to resumption of 10 to 39 days5 (Table 17). Of 
note, DOACs have been associated with lower 
rates of major bleeding complications compared 
with VKAs.23
 3. Anticoagulation is used for stroke risk reduction 
in patients with AF at risk of thromboembolism. 
For some patients, however, risk of recurrent ICH 
may be prohibitively high with anticoagulation. 
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common 
cause of lobar hemorrhage in older adults and is 
associated with annual ICH recurrence risk that 
ranges from 5% in patients with isolated microhe-
morrhages to 26.9% in patients with associated 
cortical superficial siderosis.24 Thus, in patients 
with AF and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related 
ICH, alternative strategies for secondary stroke 
prevention are often pursued. The LAA is consid-
ered the most common site for thrombus forma-
tion in patients with AF.25,26 Two RCTs—PROTECT 
AF study and PREVAIL study—compared rates 
of stroke and mortality after LAA closure versus 
VKA in patients with AF.6,7 In a meta-analysis 
examining 5-year outcomes in the 2 RCTs, LAA 
closure was associated with significant reduc-
tions in hemorrhagic stroke, disabling and fatal 
stroke, and all-cause mortality, with comparable

Synopsis
Periprocedural anticoagulation management is driven by 
2 competing aims: to hold the anticoagulant agent for the 
shortest possible time to minimize the risk of thrombo-
embolism and to ensure coagulation parameters are as 
close to normal as possible at the time of the procedure 
to facilitate hemostasis and avoid intra- and postopera-
tive bleeding. Considerations include the bleeding risk of 
the procedure, consequences of bleeding should it occur, 
patient-specific risk factors, and thrombotic risk while off 
anticoagulation. Invasive procedures and surgeries have 
been divided into high and low bleeding risks in several 
different classifications.16 Generally, endoscopic, dental 
extraction, many ophthalmologic procedures, and percu-
taneous vascular access, such as cardiac catheterization, 
are considered to be of low bleeding risk. Higher bleeding 
risk surgeries include intra-abdominal, pelvic, orthopedic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and transvenous lead extraction 
procedures. Very high bleeding risk procedures include 
neuraxial anesthesia and spinal surgery. Available data 
do not suggest high rates of bleeding from these pro-
cedures, although bleeding could cause significant con-
sequences.17 Patient-specific factors include abnormal 
liver and kidney function, bleeding or clotting disorders, 
concomitant antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammato-
ry use, alcohol, and anemia. Recent bleeding or throm-
boembolism may increase the risk for recurrent events. 
To put thrombotic risk in perspective, the incidence of 
thromboembolism while anticoagulation was temporarily 
held has generally been <1%.3,18
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. To mitigate thromboembolic risk during inter-
ruption of warfarin therapy for a procedure or 
surgery, “bridging” anticoagulation can be adminis-
tered. However, observational studies consistently 
showed an increased risk of bleeding without a dif-
ference in thromboembolic risk with this strategy.3  
The BRIDGE (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients 
who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin 
Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or 
Surgery) trial included patients with a mean 
CHADS2 score of 2.3 (range, 1-6); 61.7% of 
patients had a CHADS2 score <3.1 In this study, 
discussed in more depth below, interruption of war-
farin without bridging anticoagulation was superior 
to bridging.1 In a meta-analysis of 6 observational 
studies reporting on patients not at high throm-
boembolic risk receiving prophylactic dose or no 
bridging had an overall thromboembolic event

cially for high bleeding risk procedures.
†The number of days is the number of full days before the day of surgery in 
which the patient does not take any dose of anticoagulant. The drug is also not 
taken the day of surgery. For example, in the case of holding a twice daily drug for 
1 day, if the drug is taken at 8 pm, and surgery is at 8 am, at the time of surgery, 
it will be 36 hours since the last dose was taken.

not been done in the DOAC era, given the ease 
of brief interruption of DOAC therapy; however, 
observational studies have shown similar results.2 
The PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for 
Surgery Evaluation) cohort study, discussed below, 
enrolling patients with a mean CHADS2 score of 
2.1 (range, 1-6) and CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3.5 
(range, 1-9), found a low incidence of thromboem-
bolic events when DOAC was briefly interrupted 
without bridging.4 This suggests that in patients at 
low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk, interruption 
of anticoagulation, without bridging, may provide 
a low risk of bleeding with an acceptable risk of 
stroke/TIA. Patients with mechanical valves, and 
recent stroke/TIA, or other high-risk markers, were 
not included in most studies and may still benefit 
from bridging anticoagulation: in these scenarios, 
management should be individualized.
 2. Evidence has accrued that periprocedural unfrac-
tionated or low-molecular-weight heparin bridg-
ing has been associated with an increased risk 
of pocket hematoma after pacemaker or ICD 
procedures.19 BRUISE-CONTROL (Bridge 
or Continue Coumadin for Device Surgery 
Randomized Controlled Trial) randomized 
patients with AF (88%) or a mechanical valve 
with an estimated annual stroke risk of ≥ 5%, and 
undergoing elective device surgery, to continued warfarin versus warfarin interruption with bridg-
ing anticoagulation. The incidence of clinically 
significant pocket hematoma was >4 times 
higher in the bridging group.5 Several other pro-
cedures have been performed on uninterrupted 
anticoagulation.20 Further study is needed to 
define which procedures, in which patients, can 
safely be performed with uninterrupted antico-
agulation. Lead extraction procedures are gener-
ally considered high bleeding risk and therefore 
should be treated as such (high bleeding risk 
procedures in Table 18) and warfarin interrupted, 
with occasional exceptions.
 3. Two RCTs and several observational studies have 
shown little or no difference in the risk of pocket 
hematoma and thromboembolic events in patients 
with AF anticoagulated with DOACs and undergo-
ing device surgery.8–10 Therefore, brief interruption 
of DOAC therapy (low bleeding risk procedures in 
Table 18 may be preferable for many, while uninter-
rupted DOAC may be preferred for those at par-
ticularly high thromboembolic risk. Lead extraction 
procedures are generally considered high bleeding 
risk and therefore should be treated as such (high 
bleeding risk procedures in Table 18) and DOAC 
interrupted, with occasional exceptions.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationanticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism, the 
duration of cessation of anticoagulation should 
take into account both the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of the agent, the patient’s renal 
function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. 
Direct measurement of DOAC levels is unavailable 
in clinical practice, but levels <30 ng/mL, which 
correspond to the expected plasma DOAC concen-
tration reached after 3 half-lives, when most of the 
drug (87 .5% of the Cmax) has been eliminated, is 
reached in two-thirds of patients 24 to 48 hours 
after the last drug intake.11 Similar results were 
observed for apixaban.12 A drug “hold” of 48 hours 
in clinical practice typically means 2 full days with-
out drug intake, in addition to the day of the proce-
dure, leading to a longer interval between last drug 
intake and procedure start longer than 48 hours, 
usually an additional 12 hours. Meta-analysis of 
the reports of periprocedural events from the piv-
otal trials of each of the 4 available DOACs sug-
gested similar outcomes in patients on DOAC or 
warfarin, with reduced major bleeding during an 
uninterrupted strategy with DOACs.21 The PAUSE 
protocol was studied in patients on apixaban, dabi-
gatran, and rivaroxaban, and resulted in low rates 
of major bleeding (0.9%-1.85%) and thrombo-
embolism (<1%). A high rate (>90%) of minimal 
anticoagulant level (<50 ng/mL) was achieved. 
Similar results have been observed with edoxa-
ban in clinical practice.22 Different protocols have 
not been directly compared. Table 18 presents 
recommended DOAC interruption times based on 
agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the 
procedure.
 5. The timing of resumption of interrupted antico-
agulation after surgery is a complex decision that 
should integrate patient and surgical character-
istics. Warfarin, which takes several days (usually 
3-5) to become therapeutic, can often be restarted 
the evening of the procedure. Postoperative bridg-
ing anticoagulation has not been shown to be gen-
erally beneficial.1,13 In the PAUSE study, DOACs 
were started on the first postoperative day for low 
bleeding risk procedures and between the evening 
of the second and third postoperative days for high 
bleeding risk procedures. This resulted in a low risk 
of major bleeding.4 Input from the proceduralist 
should always be incorporated into decisions.
 6. Several studies have compared a strategy of 
bridging anticoagulation with a comparator of no 
bridging in patients on anticoagulants who were 
scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or sur-
gery. The BRIDGE trial randomized 1 884 patients 
with AF or AFL to bridging anticoagulation before 
and after the procedure with dalteparin versus pla-
cebo.1 Almost 90% of patients were undergoing low bleeding risk procedures. No bridging was 
superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding 
and was noninferior with respect to thromboembo-
lism, although the observed rate (0.4%) was lower 
than anticipated (1.0%). PERIOP2 (A Double 
Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative 
Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy 
Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who 
Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism) 
randomized patients, about two-thirds of whom 
were undergoing high bleeding risk procedures, 
and 79% of whom had AF, to postoperative bridg-
ing with dalteparin or placebo until the INR was 
>1.9. All patients received preoperative bridging. 
Bleeding and thromboembolism outcomes were 
similar.13 These studies also excluded patients with 
recent bleeding or thromboembolism, and those 
undergoing spinal and neurological surgery, and 
in these cases, management should be individual-
ized and may include bridging anticoagulation.1,13 A 
small randomized trial found that dental extractions 
could be performed on uninterrupted warfarin with-
out bridging.14 A large multicenter registry also did 
not find a difference in thromboembolism, but an 
increase in bleeding, in bridged patients.15 Patients 
with mechanical valves should be managed as 
outlined in the “2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for 
the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart 
Disease.”23

who undergo PCI, DOACs are preferred over VKAs  
in combination with APT to reduce the risk of  
clinically relevant bleeding.1–5
1 A 2. In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation 
and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1-4 
wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy 
with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over  
triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to 
reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding.1–4,6
Synopsis
Encountering a patient with AF at an increased risk for 
stroke who undergoes PCI for stable CAD or ACS is a 
common clinical scenario. The addition of APT to OAC 
after PCI introduces a risk for clinically significant bleed-
ing. RCTs have compared the safety and efficacy of vari-
ous antithrombotic regimens after PCI is performed in 
patients with AF. They have consistently shown that DO -

pared with triple therapy (oral anticoagulation, P2Y12 
inhibitor, and aspirin) without substantially increasing 
risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.1–4,6 Meta-
analyses of these trials have shown a slightly increased 
risk of stent thrombosis with dual therapy compared to 
triple therapy.5 Thus, the risk of stent thrombosis must be 
weighed against the risk of bleeding in determining the 
antithrombotic regimen after PCI. This is particularly true 
in patients with a relatively high perceived risk of stent 
thrombosis (complex revascularization, multivessel PCI, 
previous history of stent thrombosis).

tion for major bleeding in DOAC-based regimens 
compared with VKA-based regimens (OR, 0.577 
[95% CI, 0.477-0.698]; P<0.001).5 There was no 
statistically significant difference in the risk of isch-
emic events between groups. The ENTRUST-AF 
PCI (Edoxaban Treatment vs Vitamin K Antagonist 
in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial showed 
that edoxaban-based regimens were noninferior to 
VKA-based regimens in terms of clinically relevant 
bleeding after PCI.3 An important limitation of the 
aforementioned data is that most studies compared 
DOACs monotherapy against VKA plus aspirin, 
the only VKA-based dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) regimen was available in AUGUSTUS trial, 
thus providing limited information in comparison to 
DOAC-based DAT regimens available in all trials.5
 2. RCTs have supported DAT with OAC and a P2Y12 
inhibitor over triple therapy with OAC, P2Y12 
inhibitor, and aspirin to reduce the risk of clinically 
relevant bleeding in patients with AF after PCI, 
including WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet 
and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients with Oral 
Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) (VKA), 
PIONEER AF-PCI (rivaroxaban), RE-DUAL (dabi-

analysis of PIONEER AF-PCI, RE-DUAL, and 
AUGUSTUS demonstrated a 40% relative risk 
reduction for International Society on Thrombosis 
and Haemostasis major bleeding in dual therapy 
regimens compared with triple therapy (OR, 0.598 
[95% CI, 0.491-0.727]; P<0.001).5 Patients in 
the intervention group received varying dura-
tion of triple therapy with aspirin after PCI up to 
7 days. This meta-analysis showed that DAT with 
DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with 
an increased risk of stent thrombosis (OR, 1.672 
[95% CI, 1.022-2.733]; P=0.041) compared with 
triple therapy.5 This finding was mainly driven by 
outcomes in the 110-mg dosing group of dabiga-
tran in the RE-DUAL trial. The number needed to 
treat for International Society on Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis major bleeding (n=42) was substan-
tially lower than the number needed to harm for 
stent thrombosis (n=223) with DAT compared with 
triple therapy.5 Based on these findings, extended 
triple therapy up to 30 days after PCI is a consider-
ation when the perceived risk of stent thrombosis 
is high (eg, complex revascularization, multivessel 
PCI, previous history of stent thrombosis).

 1. An RCT compared the rivaroxaban monotherapy 
(n=1107) with the combination of rivaroxaban 
and a single APT (n=1108) in patients with AF 
and CCD or CAD not requiring revascularization.1 
The primary efficacy outcome was the composite 
of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, unstable angina 
requiring revascularization, or death from any 
cause. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior 
to dual therapy for the primary outcome (4.14% 
versus 5.75%/patient-year; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 
0.55-0.95]) and was superior for primary safety 
endpoint of major bleeding (1.62% versus 2.76%/
patient-year; HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.39-0.89]) com-
pared with combination therapy. Another clinical 
trial also showed the composite outcome of death 
from all causes, MI, stroke, or systemic embolism 
(15.7% versus 13.6%; HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.79-
1.72]; P=0.20 for noninferiority); the major bleed-
ing risk in the oral anticoagulation monotherapy 
group was numerically lower than the combina-
tion therapy group (7 .8% versus 10.4%; HR, 0.73 
[95% CI, 0.44-1.20]).2 However, this trial was ter-
minated prematurely because of slow enrollment 
and did not have enough power for noninferiority; 
thus, it was inconclusive. Of note, both clinical trials 
excluded patients with history of stent thrombosis. 
Further investigation of oral anticoagulation ther-
apy in patients with a history of stent thrombosis is 
needed.
6.8.3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)
Recommendation for PAD
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
2a B-NR 1. In patients with AF and concomitant stable PAD, 
monotherapy oral anticoagulation is reasonable over 
dual therapy (anticoagulation plus aspirin or P2Y12 
inhibitors) to reduce the risk of bleeding.1–5
Synopsis
Antiplatelet monotherapy is the standard of care for pa-
tients with symptomatic PAD and reasonable in asymp-tomatic PAD with ankle-brachial index ≤0.90 to reduce 
the risk of MI, stroke, and vascular death.6 The 2016 
AHA/ACC PAD guidelines recommend against antico-
agulation for ischemic event risk reduction in the general 
PAD population (COR 3; LOE A) due to increased risk of 
bleeding without significant reduction in ischemic events 
compared with antiplatelet monotherapy,6,7 without mak-
ing specific recommendations for patients with comorbid 
PAD and AF. Conversely, anticoagulation is recommend-
ed for patients with AF at intermediate-to-high risk of 
stroke due to the inferiority of APT to prevent stroke and 
systemic thromboembolism in this population. Subgroup 
analysis of landmark DOAC clinical trials demonstrate 
comparable efficacy and safety of DOACs compared 
with warfarin among patients with AF with and without 
PAD.2–4 Clinical trial evidence is lacking to guide deci-
sions regarding DAT in the setting of concomitant AF 
and PAD (whether stable PAD or after lower extremity 
revascularization). Observational studies of patients with 
concomitant AF and PAD treated with OAC monothera-
py compared with dual therapy (OAC plus antiplatelet) 
found an increased risk of bleeding on dual therapy with-
out reduction in major adverse cardiac events.5,8 How-
ever, an important limitation of these studies was the lack 
of PAD-specific outcomes such as acute or critical limb 
ischemia, revascularization, or amputation as primary or 
secondary outcomes.5,8

Recommendations for CKD/Kidney Failure
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-R 1. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and 
CKD stage 3, treatment with warfarin or, preferably, 
evidence-based doses of direct thrombin or factor  
Xa inhibitors (Table 19) is recommended to reduce 
the risk of stroke.1–3
2a B-NR 2. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and 
CKD stage 4, treatment with warfarin or labeled 
doses of DOACs is reasonable to reduce the risk  
of stroke.4,5
2b B-NR 3. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and 
who have end-stage CKD (CrCl <15 mL/min) or  
are on dialysis, it might be reasonable to prescribe  
warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) or an evidence-based dose  
of apixaban for oral anticoagulation to reduce the  
risk of stroke.6,7
Synopsis
CKD is a risk factor for stroke in patients with AF, in-
dependent of other risk factors.8 The prevalence of AF 
among patients with renal failure on dialysis is high, in-
cluding asymptomatic AF.9 Despite compelling evidence 
in the general population, conflicting data exist as to 
whether AF is a risk factor for stroke in patients on di-
alysis.10,11 Potential explanations for this discrepancy 
include competing risks of stroke and mortality, a high 
prevalence of undiagnosed AF in cohorts thought not to 
have AF, and the confounding effect of anticoagulation 
thrice weekly during hemodialysis.12 VKAs are limited by 
a markedly reduced time in therapeutic range in patients 
with severe CKD, including those on dialysis,13 and as-
sociation with calciphylaxis.14 The pivotal DOAC trials 
excluded patients on dialysis, and recommendations for 
dosing are based on pharmacokinetic data only. Early ex-
perience with dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this popula-
tion suggested an increased risk of bleeding relative to 
warfarin, driven by the higher dose of each.15 Only dabi-
gatran is substantially removed by dialysis.16 A small RCT 
and a retrospective population-based cohort study found 
a lower risk of thromboembolism with rivaroxaban ver-
sus warfarin,17,18 but these findings await confirmation in 
larger studies. Limited data on LAAO exist in this group 
of patients, and prospective comparison to anticoagula-
tion or no therapy is awaited.19
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Early trials demonstrating the role of warfarin anti-
coagulation in preventing stroke did not enroll or separately report outcomes in patients with CKD. 
An analysis of the SPAF III trial showed that dose-
adjusted warfarin, compared with fixed low-dose 
warfarin plus aspirin, reduced the risk of stroke 
with a similar magnitude to patients with normal 
kidney function.3 In the AVERROES trial of apixa-
ban versus aspirin in patients deemed unsuitable 
for warfarin, apixaban showed similar efficacy in 
patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) of 25 to 50 mL/min as those with an eGFR 
>50 mL/min.20 Patients with CKD stage 3, which 
includes those with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min, 
were enrolled in the pivotal trials of the DOACs and 
showed similar results compared with warfarin as 
seen in patients with normal kidney function.2
 2. Evidence on the use of anticoagulation in patients 
with AF and stage 4 CKD (eGFR, 15-30 mL/
min/1.73 m2) is largely observational. A prospec-
tive, multicenter cohort study of survivors of MI with 
AF found that warfarin prescription at discharge 
associated with a reduced risk of death, readmis-
sion due to MI, ischemic stroke, and bleeding.5 An 
analysis of patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL/min at 
the time of enrollment in the ARISTOTLE trial found 
numerically fewer stroke and major bleeding events 
with apixaban than warfarin.4 Because CrCl overes-
timates eGFR, a proportion of the patients enrolled 
in the pivotal clinical trials of DOACs, which used 
CrCl cut-offs for enrollment, had CKD stage 4 as 
assessed by eGFR in current clinical practice.
 3. The role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and 
severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is contro-
versial.6,7,21,22 Pending the results of RCTs compar-
ing warfarin with no treatment, and warfarin with 
DOACs, SDM incorporating risks of bleeding and 
thromboembolism is encouraged. The pivotal clinical 
trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl <25 
mL/min.23,24 Subsequently, the FDA-approved label-
ing was extended to include those with end-stage 
renal failure, including those on hemodialysis.25 A 
subsequent pharmacokinetic study found that drug 
levels with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily approximate 
those seen with 5 mg twice daily in patients with 
normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more 
appropriate dose in such patients.26 A large retro-
spective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries 
found no difference in thromboembolism, but less 
major bleeding, in patients treated with apixaban ver-
sus warfarin.27 Another analysis found an increased 
risk of thromboembolism and of fatal or intracranial 
bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no 
anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice 
daily.28 Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin 
in patients with AF on hemodialysis could not show 
differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but sig-
nificantly more bleeding than stroke events.29,30

Recommendations for AF in VHD
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-R 1. In patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mitral 
stenosis of moderate or greater severity and history  
of AF, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is 
recommended over DOACs, independent of the 
CHA2DS2-VASc score to prevent cardiovascular 
events, including stroke or death.1
1 B-NR 2. In patients with AF and valve disease other than  
moderate or greater mitral stenosis or a mechanical  
heart valve, DOACs are recommended over VKAs.2–8
Synopsis
At least one-third of patients with AF have some degree 
of VHD. Patients with AF and VHD have a higher preva-
lence of stroke and systemic thromboembolism than 
those patients with AF without VHD.9 Patients with VHD 
and AF should be evaluated for risk of thromboembolic 
events and treated with oral anticoagulation if they are 
at high risk or if they have significant mitral stenosis or 
a mechanical heart valve. VKAs are the anticoagulation 
drugs of choice for patients with rheumatic mitral steno-
sis, mechanical heart valves, and new-onset AF within 3 
months after mechanical aortic or mitral valve surgery.10
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Historical data have reported that in patients 
with mitral stenosis and AF, stroke risk was 
nearly 18-fold higher than an age-, sex-, and 
hypertension-matched population without AF.11 
More recently, stroke or systemic embolism rates 
ranged between 0.4 and 4 per 100 patient-years 
among anticoagulated patients and were high-
est in those with previous embolism. Warfarin is 
generally prescribed, but it has been questioned 
whether a DOAC may be an alternative. A ret-
rospective cohort study from Korea examined 
2230 individuals with mitral stenosis and AF 
who were prescribed either warfarin or a DOAC, using propensity matching on 10 clinical vari-
ables. Thromboembolic events in the DOAC group 
were 2.22% per year compared with 4.19% per 
year in the warfarin group (HR, 0.28 [95% CI, 
0.18-0.45]).12 However, in the INVICTUS (The 
Investigation of Rheumatic AF Treatment Using 
VKAs, Rivaroxaban or Aspirin Studies) RCT,1 
patients with AF, rheumatic heart disease, and 
mitral stenosis had a mean survival time to a pri-
mary outcome event of stroke, systemic embolism, 
MI, or death from vascular or unknown cause of 
1 675 days if treated with a VKA compared with 
1 599 days if with rivaroxaban (difference, –76 
days [95% CI, –121 to –31]; P <0.001).
 2. Although patients with moderate to severe mitral 
stenosis or mechanical valve were excluded from 
DOAC trials, other forms of VHD were allowed, 
such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. 
Bioprosthetic valves and valve repair were allowed 
in the edoxaban (ENGAGE AF) and apixaban 
(ARISTOTLE) trials, and valve repair in the rivaroxa-
ban (ROCKET AF) trial. A systematic review13 of 
patients with VHD (other than moderate to severe 
mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) concluded that 
DOACs were safe. A meta-analysis confirmed that 
DOACs decreased the risk of stroke/systemic embo-
lism compared with warfarin in patients with (HR, 
0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.86]) and without VHD (HR, 
0.84 [95% CI, 0.75-0.95]).14 However, for patients 
with mechanical heart valves,15 the RE-ALIGN 
(Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety 
and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate 
in Patients After Heart Valve Replacement)10 trial 
was halted during phase II after enrolling 252 
subjects due to increased thromboembolism and 
bleeding in the dabigatran arm. PROACT Xa (A Trial 
to Determine if Participants with an On-X Aortic 
Valve Can be Maintained Safely on Apixaban) was 
also terminated early due to higher thromboem-
bolic events with apixaban in patients who were >3 
months after mechanical On-X aortic valves.Table 19. Recommended Doses of Currently Approved DOACs According to Renal Function

1 B-NR 1. For patients with AFL, anticoagulant therapy is  
recommended according to the same risk profile  
used for AF.1–3
1 C-LD 2. In patients with AFL who undergo successful  
cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of 
sinus rhythm, anticoagulation should be continued for 
at least 4 weeks postprocedure.1–4
1 A 3. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone suc-
cessful CTI ablation and have had AF previously 
detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing 
oral anticoagulation postablation as indicated for AF.5,6
1 B-NR 4. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone suc-
cessful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high 
thromboembolic risk, without any known previous 
history of AF, should receive close follow-up and 
arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are 
not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of  
significant risk of AF.7–9
2b B-NR 5. In patients with typical AFL who have undergone  
successful CTI ablation without any known previous 
history of AF who are at high risk for development 
of AF (eg, LA enlargement, inducible AF, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], HF), it may  
be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation 
if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high  
risk (>2% annual risk) for stroke.5,10–13
*This section refers to typical right-sided (CTI-dependent) AFL. Left-sided 
AFLs or atrial tachycardias (ATs) that develop after ablation of AF should be 
anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF. “T ypical” AFL is defined 
as either typical counterclockwise AFL when the macroreentrant circuit is de-
pendent on the CTI using the isthmus from the patient’s right to left or typical 
clockwise AFL when the macroreentrant circuit is dependent on the CTI and uses 
this isthmus from the patient’s left to right. “Atypical” AFL is not dependent on the 
CTI and may arise from a macroreentrant circuit in the LA, such as perimitral or 
LA roof flutter or could be dependent on scar from previous ablation or surgery.
Synopsis
AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall 
incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the inci-
dence increases with age.14 AFL is 2.5 times more com-
mon in men than in women, and it is significantly more 
likely to occur in patients with underlying HF or COPD.14
Because of the high success rate and low recurrence 
rate of typical AFL after CTI ablation, catheter ablation is 
often used as a first-line treatment. The high effective-
ness of CTI ablation may decrease thromboembolic risk 
so that many physicians may elect to discontinue oral 
anticoagulation >1 month after ablation in the absence 
of previously detected AF. However, the high incidence 
of new onset AF at some time after CTI ablation places 
this practice in question. Because AF may be subclini-
cal or asymptomatic, patients could be at significant risk 
of thromboembolic events after ablation of typical AFL 
depending on thromboembolic risk factors.
Catheter ablation of non–CTI-dependent AFL is 
technically more difficult, and “atypical” AFL or AT often 
occurs after AF ablation. These arrhythmias should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF. 
Recommendations in this section refer to treatment of 
“typical” AFL.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. AFL is associated with increased thromboembolic 
risk, but the exact risk and benefit of oral antico-
agulation are difficult to ascertain as AFL and AF 
often coexist. In a population-based retrospective 
cohort study of patients with typical AFL and no 
history of AF, stroke occurred in 4.1% of patients 
with AFL compared with 1.2% of a general pop-
ulation-matched cohort (P<0.001).1 However, no 
large, randomized trials specifically address throm-
boembolic risks and benefits of anticoagulation in 
patients who have only AFL.
   In patients referred for ablation of typical AFL 
without adequate previous appropriate anticoagu-
lation, and no previous history of AF, TEE showed 
evidence for LA thrombus or dense spontaneous 
echocardiographic contrast in 3%.2 A systematic 
review identified thromboembolic event rates of 
0% to 6% with cardioversion, with the highest inci-
dence of thromboembolic events occurring 1 to 2 
days postcardioversion of AFL.3 Echocardiographic 
studies reported LA thrombus in 0% to 38% and 
spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in 21% 
to 28% of cases.3 In 1 ablation study, thromboem-
bolic events occurred in 13.9% of patients who did 
not receive anticoagulation.3 Observational studies 
report an elevated risk of stroke with AFL com-
pared with a control group (RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.35-
1.46]) and elevated mortality risk (risk ratio, 1.9 
[95% CI, 1.2-3.1]) with long-term follow-up.3
 2. The incidence of embolism after cardioversion of 
AFL is similar to that of AF (0.72% versus 0.46%; 
P=not significant).4 Atrial stunning has been noted 
on TEE in patients undergoing cardioversion of AF, 
with partial atrial recovery 15 to 30 days and full 
recovery 30 to 90 days postcardioversion.15 LAA 
stunning also occurs in patients with AFL, although 
it appears to occur at a lesser degree than what 
is seen with AF.16 Although limited data are avail-
able for AFL, 1 study demonstrated more force-
ful mechanical LAA contraction and absence of 
spontaneous echocardiographic contrast 2 weeks 
after ablation of persistent AFL, suggesting ear-
lier recovery.17 Because LA and LAA stunning are 
thought to contribute to thrombus formation and 
thromboembolic events after cardioversion, con-
tinued anticoagulation is recommended early after 
conversion to sinus rhythm.
 3. In a meta-analysis, the subsequent incidence of AF 
after ablation of CTI-dependent AFL was 34% over 
14 months. However, the incidence of AF after flut-
ter ablation is significantly higher in patients with

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationa history of AF before ablation than those without 
AF before ablation (53% versus 23% after 16-18 
months; P<0.05).5 The incidence of AF continues 
to increase over time in both patients with and 
without previous AF.5 Oral anticoagulation reduces 
risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism in the 
setting of nonvalvular AF.6 Because AF is not nec-
essarily reduced after ablation of AFL, continued 
anticoagulation is recommended based on throm-
boembolic risk assessment.The acute success rate 
for catheter ablation typical AFL is reported to be 
92% with a single procedure and 97% with multiple 
procedures in a meta-analysis.18 However, the sub-
sequent incidence of AF occurring after ablation 
of CTI-dependent AFL is reported to be 16% to 
82%,5,10,11 with a higher incidence in patients with 
a history of AF before ablation than those without 
(53% versus 23% after 16-18 months; P<0.05).5  
In 1 study, 82% of patients who underwent typi-
cal AFL ablation experienced new-onset AF during 
long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months).11
 4. Because of the high rate of occurrence of new-
onset AF after CTI ablation, close follow-up and 
monitoring are recommended. In patients undergo-
ing AFL ablation, the detection of AF in patients 
without previous AF significantly increased with more frequent monitoring and/or longer duration of 
follow-up.7 This is especially important in patients 
at high risk of stroke or thromboembolism (>2%/
year). Intermittent monitoring may be performed 
with ambulatory monitors or wearable devices. 
Alternatively, implantable devices can provide more 
prolonged and continuous monitoring. Implantable 
cardiac monitors have been used in multiple set-
tings to detect AF, including after AF ablation or in 
patients with cryptogenic stroke. Implantable car-
diac monitors have also been used for surveillance 
after AF ablation.9
 5. Factors that predict AF after flutter ablation include 
LA enlargement,19–21 inducible AF at the time of 
flutter ablation,22,23 interatrial conduction time,24 
prolonged HV interval,25 COPD,26 obstructive sleep 
apnea,20 and HATCH (hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, 
TIA or stroke, COPD, heart failure) score.21 One study 
that reported new-onset AF in 38% of patients after 
AFL ablation demonstrated a thromboembolic event 
rate of 10% during a mean follow-up of 5 years.12 
In a Danish registry of patients undergoing flutter 
ablation, 5% of patients suffered a stroke, and 10% 
died during a mean follow-up of 4 years.13
   Thus, patients who undergo successful flut-
ter ablation are not free from thromboembolic

7 .1. Broad Considerations for Rate Control
Recommendations for Broad Considerations for Rate Control
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. In patients with AF, SDM with the patient is recom-
mended to discuss rhythm- versus rate-control  
strategies (taking into consideration clinical presen-
tation, comorbidity burden, medication profile, and 
patient preferences), discuss therapeutic options,  
and for assessing long-term benefits.1–3
2a B-R 2. In patients with AF without HF who are candidates  
for select rate-control strategies, heart rate target 
should be guided by underlying patient symptoms, in 
general aiming at a resting heart rate of <100 to  
110 bpm.2,4–6
Synopsis
Rate control is a suitable strategy for many patients 
with AF.1,3 A solitary randomized trial has evaluated 
the optimal heart rate among patients with AF. In the 
RACE II study (Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent 
Atrial Fibrillation: A Comparison Between Lenient Ver-
sus Strict Rate Control II), 614 patients with perma-
nent AF were randomly assigned to either lenient rate 
control (resting heart rate <110 bpm) or strict rate 
control (heart rate, <80 bpm). A difference was not 
seen regarding either the primary composite outcome 
of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization 
for HF, stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, and life-
threatening arrhythmic events (absolute difference of 
–2.0 percentage points [90% CI, –7 .6 to 3.5; P <0.001] 
for the noninferiority margin)2 or the secondary out-
come of QOL7 at 3 years. These data suggest heart 
rate control intensity is not a central determinant of 
clinical outcomes. However, interpretation is limited by 
a difference of only 10 bpm between study groups 
attributable to the proportion of patients assigned to 
strict control who did not achieve target rate control 
(32.6%; n=98/301) and because 78% of lenient rate 
control participants having heart rate <100 bpm.8 In 
addition, because patients with HF were underrep-
resented, whether the results can be extrapolated to 
those with HF is unknown. Nonrandomized data fo-
cused on target heart rate among outpatients,4,9,10 as 
well as those with HF,5,11–16 are divergent.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Rate- and rhythm-control strategies have com-
parable clinical outcomes in many patients with 
AF. In the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up 
Investigation of Rhythm Management) study, rate 
control was comparable to cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs regarding survival (HR, 1.15 
[95% CI, 0.99-1.34]; P=0.08).1 In the HOT CAFE 
(How to Treat Chronic Atrial Fibrillation) trial, rate 
control was comparable to cardioversion and use 
of antiarrhythmic drugs with respect to a composite 
endpoint of all-cause mortality, number of thrombo-
embolic events, or major bleeding (OR, 1.98 [95% 
CI, 0.28-22.3]; P>0.71).6 In a meta-analysis of ran-
domized trials and observational studies comparing 
rhythm with rate control, management strategies 
were comparable with respect to all-cause (OR, 
1.34 [95% CI, 0.89-2.02]) and cardiac mortality 
(OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.77-1.20]) as well as stroke 
(OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76-1.30]).3 Although selec-
tion of a rhythm-control therapy within a year of 
AF diagnosis may be considered to reduce the risk 
of adverse cardiovascular outcomes,17 early rate 
control may still be appropriate as a function of 
clinical presentation, comorbidity burden, medica-
tion profile, and patient preferences. In this con-
text, providers should partner with their patients to 
select a value-concordant approach within an SDM 
framework.
 2. In RACE II, rate-control intensity (target resting 
heart rate, <110 bpm versus <80 bpm) did not 
influence cardiovascular morbidity or mortality.6,18 
Rate control (AFFIRM: goal heart rate, ≤80 bpm 
at rest and ≤110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test; 
HOT CAFE: 70-90 bpm at rest and ≤140 bpm with 
moderate exercise) has been shown to be com-
parable to rhythm control in a meta-analysis of 5 
trials, yet some limitation of the studies include that 
most patients had well-tolerated persistent AF or 
high risk of recurrence, no long-term follow-up, and 
should not be extrapolated to patients with parox-
ysmal AF, highly symptomatic, or patients with HF.1 
Observational data among outpatients and those 
with HF are conflicting.4 In the ORBIT-AF trial, 
increasing heart rate was associated with higher 
all-cause mortality9 and incident HF.10 Whether 
a lenient rate-control strategy may be safely and 
effectively used in patients with heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)5,14 or reduced 
fraction11–13,15,16 has also shown conflicting results. 
Other populations that may benefit from a low 
heart rate goal include those with rate-related car-
diac dysfunction,19 ICDs,20 cardiac resynchroniza-
tion therapy,21 and tachycardia-bradycardia form of 
sick sinus syndrome22 (Table 20).

ling AF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 
slow conduction through the atrioventricular node and 
have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. These 
agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the ab-
sence of preexcitation. They provide reasonable rate 
control and also improve AF-related symptoms com-
pared with beta blockers.1,2 Beta blockers also slow 
conduction through the atrioventricular node by block-
ing beta-1 receptors. Digoxin is a time-honored medi-
cation for patients with AF particularly among patients 
with HFrEF due to its positive inotropic and vagotonic 
effects. Limited data exist directly comparing rate-con-
trol agents, especially in the setting of long-term rate 
control. Selection of specific agents should consider 
patient-specific characteristics and response. This sec-
tion will outline the principles of treatment for acute and 
long-term rate control.

rate-control agent.
Synopsis
Controlling the ventricular rate in AF with a rapid ventric-
ular response in the acute setting can vary effectiveness 
for control of symptoms. It can also present challenges, 
given some agents may or may not be preferable in the 
context of underlying comorbidities given the myriad of 
contributing factors. For patients requiring intravenous 
rate-control agents, hypotension and/or the presence of 
decompensated HF may limit use of otherwise effica-
cious agents. In the acute setting, recognizing patients 
needing emergency cardioversion is important.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
investigated the safety and efficacy of continuous 
intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart 
rate control during AF and AFL. Seventeen of the 
23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and 
none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a 
therapeutic response for 24 hours. Over 24 hours, 
patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response 
significantly more slowly than did those receiving 
placebo infusion. In another RCT, patients were ran-
domly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous 
diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate 
control. At 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 
119 of 150 patients (79%). The time to rate control 
was significantly shorter among patients in the dil-
tiazem group, with the percentage of patients who 
achieved rate control being higher in the diltiazem 
group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the 
amiodarone group (74%). A randomized, parallel, 
open-label study aimed to investigate esmolol ver-
sus verapamil in the acute treatment of AF or AFL. 
The heart rate significantly declined with esmo-
lol and verapamil. Fifty percent of esmolol-treated 
patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted 
to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who 
received verapamil converted. Mild hypotension was 
observed in both treatment groups.

effective in controlling the rate of rapid AF compared Table 20 Clinical Presentations and Objectives of Heart

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationwith placebo in 1 multicenter RCT.5 However, other 
agents may be safer and more effective in achieving 
acute rate control. Intravenous diltiazem was more 
effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7 
One trial performed at an emergency department at 
an academic center randomized 150 patients with 
AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular 
rate >120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltia-
zem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6 The time to reduce 
the heart rate <90 bpm was significantly shorter in 
the diltiazem group compared with either digoxin or 
amiodarone, with fewer symptoms and shorter hos-
pital lengths of stay. Another RCT of 30 patients 
randomized patients with AF and a rapid ventricular 
response to either intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or 
a combination of both agents. Treatment with intra-
venous diltiazem significantly decreased heart rate 
within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous 
digoxin.7 Intravenous diltiazem reduced heart rate more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-
blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, 
with similar control at 12 to 24 hours. In another 
RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to 
the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone 
resulted in faster control of the ventricular response 
compared with intravenous digoxin.8 Finally, 52 
patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive 
either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and 
digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more 
rapid and durable response to the combination.9
 3. In addition to atrioventricular nodal blockers and 
antiarrhythmics, intravenous magnesium has been 
investigated for rate controlling rapid AF. 10,11 The 
mechanism likely stems from blockade of slow 
inward calcium channels in the sinoatrial and atrio-
ventricular node, thereby slowing the heart rate 
and prolonging atrioventricular conduction veloc-
ity, respectively.16 Its low adverse effect profile Table 21. Pharmacological Agents for Rate Control in Patients With AF

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationand minimal toxicity make it a favorable option, 
often as an adjunct to conventional therapy (ie, 
atrioventricular nodal blockers). A meta-analysis 
including 6 RCTs (n=745 patients) investigated 
the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium in 
rate and rhythm control of rapid AF when admin-
istered in combination with standard rate-control 
methods (including beta blockers, diltiazem, vera-
pamil, digoxin), as well as placebo. In the pooled 
analysis, intravenous magnesium was superior 
in achieving rate control (63% versus 40%; OR, 
2.49 [95% CI, 1.80-3.45]) and modestly effective 
in rhythm conversion to sinus (21% versus 14%; 
OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08-2.84]) compared with 
standard rate-control methods. Subgroup analy-
sis showed the superiority of a lower dose (≤ 5 g) 
(24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22-3.61]) 
compared with the higher dose (>5 g) (16% ver-
sus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65-2.32]) in rhythm 
control when compared with placebo.10
 4. Intravenous amiodarone has been shown to be 
effective in controlling ventricular rates in patients 
who are critically ill. In a retrospective study of 38 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit, intra-
venous amiodarone was associated with a statis-
tically significant decrease in heart rate without 
decrease in BP compared with intravenous dil-
tiazem and digoxin.12 One study of 60 critically ill 
patients, predominantly with AF, with heart rate 
consistently >120 bpm randomized patients to 1 
of 3 intravenous treatment regimens: diltiazem in 
a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours; amiodarone in a 300-
mg bolus; and amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus fol-
lowed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours.13 A >30% rate 
reduction within 4 hours was not statistically dif-
ferent in either treatment arm, with less effective 
control more frequently observed in those receiv-
ing a bolus of amiodarone alone; thus overall, dil-
tiazem allowed for significantly better heart rate 
control over 24 hours, but it also caused a signifi-
cantly higher incidence of hypotension requiring 
discontinuation of the drug.
 5. Limited data exist regarding the use of nondihydro-
pyridine calcium channel blockers in patients with 
HFrEF, due to the presumed limitation of negative 
inotropic effects. Two retrospective analyses high-
light potential for increased morbidity when admin-
istered in this population. In a retrospective analysis 
of patients hospitalized with AF with rapid ven-
tricular rate (RVR), diltiazem was associated with 
an increased risk of acute kidney injury within 48 
hours of initiation of diltiazem in those patients with 
L VEF ≤50%, compared with those with normal EF 
(10% versus 3.6%; P=0.002).14 An additional ret-
rospective analysis compared patients with HFrEF 
receiving either intravenous metoprolol or diltiazem. 
There was a higher incidence of worsening HF 
symptoms (increased oxygen requirement within 
4 hours or initiation of inotropic support with 48 
hours) in those patients receiving diltiazem (33% 
versus 15%; P=0.019). Neither analysis noted an 
increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a 
higher level of care, or hypotension.

Synopsis
Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (vera-
pamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for 
long-term rate control. These agents are useful in ventric-
ular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin 
may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other 
agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult 
to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing 
various rate control agents, especially in the setting of 
chronic rate control. Selection of specific agents should 
consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, HFrEF, reac-
tive airway disease) and response (Figure 18).
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. One prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, 
crossover study compared the effect of 4 rate-
reducing once-daily drug regimens on the ventric-
ular heart rate and arrhythmia-related symptoms 
in patients with permanent AF. The 24-hour mean 
heart rate was 96±12 bpm at baseline (no treat-
ment), 75±10 bpm with diltiazem, 81±11 bpm 
with verapamil, 82±11 bpm with metoprolol, and 
84±11 bpm with carvedilol. All drugs significantly 
reduced the heart rate compared with baseline.13 
In a retrospective cohort study, investigators used 
a database from 2 urban emergency departments 
to identify consecutive patients with emergency 
department discharge diagnoses of AF. A total of 
259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 
receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiv-
ing beta blockers. Baseline demographics and 
comorbidities were similar. Twenty-seven percent 
of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers 
were admitted, and there were no significant dif-
ferences in emergency department length of stay, 
adverse events, or 7- or 30-day emergency depart-
ment revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM 
study examined the difference in all hospitalization 
and all-cause mortality in participants treated with 
a single rate-control agent at baseline. No differ-
ence was found among those participants receiv-
ing beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers, or digoxin.2
 2. Seminal work investigating digoxin toxicity was 
based on a small series of patients, where toxic-
ity was determined by electrocardiographic abnor-
malities.14 Toxicity was seen when serum digoxin 
concentrations exceeded 2.0 ng/mL, and almost 
certainly at levels >3.0 ng/mL. Based on this small 
study, the narrow therapeutic range of digoxin is 
usually cited as 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL, with substan-
tial variation across institutional laboratories and 
published references.15,16 However, 3 post hoc 
analyses of the DIG (Digitalis Investigation Group) 
trial suggested that safe use of digoxin is seen at 
lower serum concentrations.4–6 Serum digoxin con-
centrations of 0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL were associated 
with significantly lower all-cause mortality rates 
and hospitalizations compared with concentrations 
≥1.0 ng/mL.3 Another analysis suggested that 
serum digoxin concentrations >1.2 ng/mL may be 
harmful, particularly in women.7 A post hoc analy-
sis comparing patients with AF taking digoxin with 
propensity score-matched controls suggested that 
patients with serum digoxin concentrations <0.9 
ng/mL had no increased risk of death, concen-
trations of 0.9 to 1.1 ng/mL had a nonsignificant 
increased risk of death, and serum digoxin concen-
trations ≥1.2 ng/mL were associated with a signifi-
cant (56%) increased risk of death.4 Serum digoxin 
concentrations of 0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL seem safest in 
terms of benefit without adverse effects in patients 
with HFrEF.17
 3. Digoxin may have added efficacy as rate control 
in conjunction with beta blockers in patients with 
AF. A small RCT of 47 patients with persistent AF 
and concomitant HFrEF compared the effects of 
digoxin alone, carvedilol alone, and their combina-
tion.10 Combination therapy was significantly asso-
ciated with better rate control and symptom relief 
than monotherapy with either agent. The RATE-AF 
trial randomized 160 patients with persistent AF 
and concomitant HFrEF to digoxin and bisopro-
lol.11 No significant differences in the primary end-
point of QOL were noted at 6 months with either 
agent. Several secondary outcomes, including 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, were 
significantly lower in the digoxin group, without a

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationsignificant difference in resting heart rate between 
the 2 groups at 12 months. Adverse effects were 
less common in the digoxin group. A large meta-
analysis of 75 studies and approximately 620 000 
patients found a significantly increased risk of 
death in digoxin users overall but, when limited to 7  
RCTs (∼8400 patients), no difference in mortality 
rate was observed between digoxin or placebo—
of note, these 7 RCTs in the subanalysis were in 
patients with concomitant HF.9 A post hoc sensi-
tivity analysis assessing the impact of digoxin on 
mortality in patients with HF and concomitant AF 
found no impact on overall mortality in patients tak-
ing digoxin, most with HFrEF.
 4. MDPIT (Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial) 
demonstrated an association of worsening HF in 
patients with a recent MI, with L V dysfunction ran-
domized to diltiazem. Among those with a baseline 
EF of <40%, late HF appeared in significantly 
more patients receiving diltiazem compared with 
placebo (21% versus 12%; P=0.004). Life table 
analysis in patients with an EF of <40% confirmed 
significantly more frequent late HF in those tak-
ing diltiazem. In addition, the diltiazem-associated 
rise in the frequency of late congestive heart failure 
(CHF) was progressively greater with increasingly 
severe decrements in baseline EF.10
 5. The safety and efficacy of dronedarone, origi-
nally designed as an antiarrhythmic to maintain 
sinus rhythm in patients with AF, was addressed 
in several seminal trials.18–20 PALLAS (Palbociclib 
Collaborative Adjuvant Study) was designed to 
investigate whether dronedarone would reduce 
major vascular events or hospitalizations in patients 
with permanent AF. The benefits of dronedarone 
in patients with permanent AF were initially sug-
gested from the ERATO (Efficacy and Safety of 
Dronedarone for the Control of ventricular rate 
during atrial fibrillation) trial, which showed a significant reduction in the ventricular response for 
patients with paroxysmal and permanent AF in the 
24-hour setting, which were carried forward in a 
6-month follow-up.12 PALLAS randomized approxi-
mately 3200 patients with permanent AF at high 
risk for adverse events. The trial was terminated 
early, because of the strong signal for harm in 43 
patients receiving dronedarone versus 19 receiv-
ing placebo, namely death (13/21 due to arrhyth-
mia), stroke, and hospitalization for HF.12
7 .3. Atrioventricular Nodal Ablation (AVNA)
Recommendations for AVNA
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 C-LD 1. In patients with AF and a persistently rapid  
ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial  
pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 
90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death.1,2
2a B-R 2. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular 
response refractory to rate-control medications (who 
are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has 
been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve 
symptoms and QOL.3–6
1 B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo 
AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the  
ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is  
recommended to ensure adequacy of the pacing 
leads before performing ablation.7–9
2b C-LD 4. In patients with AF with normal EF undergoing AVNA, 
conduction system pacing of the His bundle10–13 or  
left bundle area12,13 may be reasonable.
Synopsis
AVNA provides ventricular rate control effectively and 
without medications yet creates dependence on pacing.3 
Consideration of the consequences of lifelong pace-
maker implantation, particularly with respect to age and 
comorbidities, is central to decision-making regarding 
benefit.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSmall RCTs of AVNA and right ventricular pacing 
(RVP) have shown improvements in symptoms and QOL 
compared with medical rate control alone but found no 
significant differences in EF or other measures of car-
diac performance.3,14 Progression to persistent AF is 
described in many patients with previously paroxysmal 
AF after AVNA.15,16 Antiarrhythmic drugs reduce the 
transition to permanent AF but do not improve QOL or 
echocardiographic parameters, and patients treated with 
antiarrhythmic drugs have more episodes of HF and hos-
pitalizations.17
Early concerns regarding AVNA included risks for 
device-related complications, sudden cardiac death, and 
worsened HF. Deaths due to malignant arrhythmias have 
been nearly eradicated by programming higher lower-
rate pacing in the early postprocedure period.1,2,18 The 
risks of HF may be ameliorated by non-RVP strategies, 
but data are limited in patients who do not have HF 
before AVNA.19
Overall, long-term data on outcomes after AVNA are 
limited, and no evidence supports AVNA as first-line 
therapy.9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Early observational studies showed a concerning 
incidence of sudden death after AVNA in 3% to 
7% of patients.20,21 This immediate postprocedural 
risk results from ventricular fibrillation (VF) pre-
dominantly due to bradycardia, QT prolongation, 
and heterogeneity of repolarization. Initiation of VF 
is often pause dependent or occurs during a rela-
tively slow pacing rate.18 Deaths due to malignant 
arrhythmias have been minimized by current proto-
cols specifying higher lower-rate pacing in patients 
after AVNA in the early postprocedure period.1,2,18 
Subsequent lower rate adjustment is performed 
over the course of several weeks.
 2. AVNA and pacemaker implantation provide safe 
and effective rate control in the fraction of patients 
with AF who cannot be effectively rate controlled 
with medical therapy3,4,22 and in whom sinus rhythm 
has failed or is not deemed to be effective. A 
meta-analysis of 6 small RCTs of studies compar-
ing AVNA and pacemaker versus medical therapy 
or medical therapy with pacemaker including 323 
subjects with paroxysmal or persistent AF showed 
improvement in symptoms and QOL in the AVNA 
group.6 No differences in survival, stroke, hospital-
ization, EF, or exercise capacity were found. There 
was no effect of AVNA on all-cause mortality in 
a pooled analysis.6 Nonrandomized studies have 
shown improvement in a range of clinical out-
comes5 in addition to data showing improved EF 
in patients with suspected tachycardia-related car-
diomyopathy after AVNA.23 These favorable find-
ings in nonrandomized studies are likely subject to the placebo effect of device implantation. Early 
and late complication rates are not inconsequen-
tial, specifically in young patients in view of the risk 
of pacemaker-mediated cardiomyopathy, and long-
term follow-up data are scant.9
 3. Although few studies concerning AVNA and pac-
ing report complication rates for the pacemaker 
implant, the overall risk of lead dislodgement or 
failure is approximately 2%, and many operators 
perform both AVNA and pacemaker implant dur-
ing the same procedure.9,13,24 Practice patterns 
vary, however, and a European survey indicated up 
to 80% of operators will choose to perform AVNA 
1 to 3 months after pacemaker implantation to 
reduce risk of adverse outcome due to early lead 
dislodgement.25 In the prospective FOLLOWPACE 
registry from 23 centers in the Netherlands, lead 
dislodgment was the most frequent lead-related 
complication, occurring in 3.3% of patients within 
the first 2 months of implant.7 Relevant to the older 
age population usually undergoing AVNA, a pooled 
patient-level analysis of 4814 subjects from 
CTOPP (Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing), 
UKPACE (United Kingdom pacing and cardiovas-
cular events), and Danish pacing trials—designed 
to compare pacemaker implantation complication 
rates in age <75 years versus age ≥75 years—
found a higher risk of early complications in those 
age ≥75 years (5% versus 3%), driven by a higher 
rate of lead dislodgement (2%) and pneumothorax 
(1.6%).8 If AVNA and pacing are performed con-
comitantly, ideally, leads should be placed first to 
ensure adequate lead function.
 4. HF after AVNA is attributed to the deleterious 
effects of RVP,26 and risk is correlated with base-
line cardiac function.9 The PAVE (Post AV Nodal 
Ablation Evaluation) trial compared outcomes in 
patient with persistent AF and uncontrolled rates 
undergoing AVNA and RVP with AVNA and biven-
tricular pacing (BiVP) and found an improvement 
in 6-minute walk test and EF, but benefit was pre-
dominantly seen in subjects with EF <45% or New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF at 
baseline.27 Not all patients appear to be at high risk 
of HF after AVNA and RVP.28 Because the benefit 
is less and the risk of complications is higher in 
BiVP compared with conventional pacing, RVP is 
advised in patients with preserved EF undergoing 
AVNA.19
   Conduction system pacing of the His bundle 
or left bundle area offers promise to reduce the 
risk of RVP-induced cardiomyopathy and improve 
outcomes. Early studies have justifiably focused 
on patients with HF undergoing AVNA, and lim-
ited data are available in patients with preserved 
EF and no HF diagnosis.27 His bundle pacing with

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-R 1. In patients with reduced L V function and persistent  
(or high burden) AF, a trial of rhythm control should  
be recommended to evaluate whether AF is  
contributing to the reduced L V function.1–6
2a B-R 2. In patients with symptomatic AF, rhythm control can 
be useful to improve symptoms.7–11
2a B-R 3. In patients with a recent diagnosis of AF (<1 year), 
rhythm control can be useful to reduce hospitaliza-
tions, stroke, and mortality.12–14
2a B-R 4. In patients with AF and HF, rhythm control can be 
useful for improving symptoms and improving out-
comes, such as mortality and hospitalizations for HF 
and ischemia.15–19
2a B-NR 5. In patients with AF, rhythm-control strategies can be 
useful to reduce the likelihood of AF progression.20–27
2b C-LD 6. In patients with AF where symptoms associated with 
AF are uncertain, a trial of rhythm control (eg, cardio-
version or pharmacological therapy) may be useful to 
determine what if any symptoms are attributable to 
AF.28–32
2b B-NR 7 . In patients with AF, rhythm-control strategies may 
be useful to reduce the likelihood of development of 
dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormali-
ties.33–45
Synopsis
When caring for a patient with AF, deciding between 
rhythm and rate control is important but critical to ac-
knowledge that the decision is nuanced, can evolve over 
time, and that the 2 strategies are necessarily not mu-
tually exclusive depending on the definition used. For 
example, in EAST-AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial 
Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial), which random-
ized patients with recently identified AF to rhythm- or 
rate-control strategies, in those patients randomized to 
the rhythm control arm, initially 87% were treated with 
antiarrhythmic drugs and 8% with AF ablation; but, at 2 
years, 35% were not on antiarrhythmic drugs or had re-
ceived AF ablation.12 Similarly, although the decision on 
whether to use rhythm control is often based on symp-
toms, in a post hoc analysis of the same trial, benefits in the composite outcome of death, stroke, or cardiac 
hospitalization was observed in all patients regardless 
of whether symptoms were present or not.30 Data from 
EAST-AFNET 4 and large registries have consistently 
demonstrated the importance of monitoring patients for 
increased AF burden once AF has been identified and 
that rhythm-control therapies are more likely to be suc-
cessful when implemented early when AF burden begins 
to increase.13,14,30 ,46,47 Finally, for all patients with AF, con-
tinued long-term management of modifiable risk factors 
is essential.48
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. AF and reduced L V function are often recognized 
in the same patient, with the combination being 
associated with worse prognosis when compared 
with patients with either HF or AF alone.1,49 Several 
studies have demonstrated improved L V func-
tion in patients with AF after restoration of sinus 
rhythm.2–6 The incidence of AF or other atrial 
arrhythmias as an important contributor to reduced 
L VEF is unknown and likely dependent on arrhyth-
mia burden, ventricular rates, and other factors.4–6 
However, in patients who present with both AF 
and reduced L V function or develop reduced L V 
function after an initial diagnosis of AF, where no 
identifiable cause for the reduced L V function is 
observed, AF should initially be assumed as a very 
possible cause until proven otherwise. Although 
AF as a cause for reduced L V function is usually 
considered in the setting of rapid ventricular rates, 
improved L V function with rhythm control has been 
reported in the setting of AF with relatively well 
controlled heart rates.2,3
 2. Rhythm and rate control can improve symptoms 
in AF.7,8,50,51 Multiple studies have shown improved 
QOL with rhythm control.7–9,50,51 Continued symp-
toms due to AF are common with rate control. In 
the RACE II study, lenient rate control had similar 
primary outcomes (a combination of cardiovascu-
lar death, hospitalization for HF, and several other 
endpoints) compared to strict rate control, but at 
the end of the follow-up period (>2 years), 46% of 
patients in both groups had continued symptoms 
associated with AF.10 Although a different popula-
tion, symptoms due to recurrent AF were identified 
in 56 of 303 (18%) patients with newly identified 
AF undergoing rhythm control with either AADs or 
catheter ablation.11
 3. EAST-AFNET 4 randomized 2733 patients with 
early onset AF (<1 year) and other risk factors 
for stroke to rhythm control or rate-control strat-
egies.12 Rhythm control was associated with a

tality rate, stroke, and hospitalizations due to HF

when compared with rate control, early initiation 
of rhythm control (<1 year) in patients with AF 
was associated with 15% and 19% reductions in 
the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for ischemia or 
HF, respectively.13,14 However, these recent find-
ings must be balanced against studies that have 
reported increased emergency department visits 
and health care resource utilization associated with 
rhythm control.52–54
 4. In the AF-CHF (Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive 
Heart Failure) trial, rhythm control did not affect 
cardiovascular mortality but was associated 
with improved QOL.15,55 Contemporary trials 
in patients with AF and HF, regardless of L V 
function, and often using catheter ablation as 
an important therapy, have reported trends or 
statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes associated with rhythm control when 
compared to rate control.16,17,49,56–58 In an analysis 
of patients with HF in EAST-AFNET 4, rhythm 
control was associated with a significant reduc-
tion in the composite primary endpoint of car-
diovascular death, stroke, or hospitalization due 
to HF or acute ischemic syndrome (HR, 0.74 
[95% CI, 0.56-0.97]; P =0.03).16 Similarly, in the 
CABANA (Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic 
Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) trial, cath-
eter ablation-based rhythm control was asso-
ciated with a 46% reduction in the mortality 
rate in patients with HF compared with medi-
cal therapy.19 Although catheter ablation is more 
effective in maintaining sinus rhythm than anti-
arrhythmic drugs, maintenance of sinus rhythm 
was higher in the AF-CHF trial. In this study, 
amiodarone was the preferential strategy for 
rhythm control (82% of patients) compared

66%), and additionally the benefit of rhythm 
control in patients with HF is likely greatest in 
those patients with recently identified AF.15–18, 49
 5. AF commonly, but not always, progresses over 
time to higher burdens and becomes more sus-
tained.20,59 Large registry studies have reported 
that AF progression is more commonly observed 
with a rate-control strategy compared to a 
rhythm-control strategy over a 1- to 2-year period, 
although the absolute magnitude and difference 
has varied. For example, in 2 registry studies, pro-
gression to a more sustained form of AF burden 
was observed in 26% to 28% of patients under-
going a rate-control strategy compared with 6% 
to 11% of patients treated with a rhythm-control 
strategy while, in an analysis of the ORBIT AF 
trial, although rhythm control was associated with 
a lower likelihood of progression, AF progression 
was much more common regardless of strategy 
(66% for rate control and 56% for rhythm control) 
likely due to older patients in this cohort.21–23 AF progression is a complex process, and although 
the choice between rhythm-control and rate-con-
trol strategy has an impact, many other factors 
such as age, presence or absence of HF or other 
comorbidities, LA size, heart rate, and modifiable 
risk factors are also important.21–27
 6. The reported prevalence of asymptomatic AF var-
ies from 10% to 40% depending on study cohort.28 
Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with AF 
have similar risks for death and stroke.28,29 In a 
post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, similar mag-
nitudes of benefit were observed in symptomatic 
and asymptomatic patients for reducing the com-
bined endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, and 
hospitalization for HF.30 Nevertheless, the evidence 
base for the benefits of a rhythm-control trial in 
asymptomatic patients with sinus rhythm is limited. 
Improved energy with return to sinus rhythm was 
noted in 1 observational study of 13 asymptomatic 
patients with persistent AF.31 In another study that 
included 18 asymptomatic patients, at 1-month fol-
low-up, no patients had improvement in symptoms, 
although sinus rhythm was maintained in only 35% 
of patients.32 In 2 small studies that focused on the 
impact of catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients, 
maintenance of sinus rhythm was associated with

 7 . AF is associated with increased cognitive impair-
ment, progressive increase in AF burden, and 
structural changes in the heart.33,34 Nonrandomized 
studies from registries or post hoc analyses of ran-
domized trials have reported that rhythm control 
is associated with a reduction in the incidence of 
dementia and development of HF.36–38 Furthermore, 
AF can also be an etiologic reason for mitral regur-
gitation or tricuspid regurgitation.39–45 In 1 study of 
53 patients referred for AF ablation with moderate 
mitral regurgitation or worse, maintenance of sinus 
rhythm at follow-up was associated with signifi-
cant decreases in LA size, mitral annular dilatation, 
and mitral regurgitation.39 In another study, 70% 
of patients undergoing ablation for AF who main-
tained sinus rhythm at follow-up had improvement 
in mitral regurgitation.40 Similar results have been 
found in tricuspid valve function as assessed by 
echocardiography.42–45
8.2. Electrical and Pharmacological 
Cardioversion
Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute 
rhythm control. Cardioversion can be achieved electrically 
or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapid-
ity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with 
hemodynamic instability attributable to AF. Acute rhythm 
control with cardioversion should also be considered for 
patients with hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of 
atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable 
to achieve adequate rate control. In patients with hemo-
dynamically stable AF, both electrical cardioversion and 
pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and 
efficacious methods for acute rhythm control.1–3 Electri-
cal cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological 
cardioversion alone4,5 but involves the trade-off of anes-
thesia or sedation.6 Thromboembolic risks and consider-
ations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological 
cardioversion and electrical cardioversion.7,8

COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-R 1. In patients with AF duration of ≥ 48 hours, a  
3-week duration of uninterrupted therapeutic anti-
coagulation or imaging evaluation to exclude intra-
cardiac thrombus is recommended before elective 
cardioversion.11 B-NR 2. In patients with AF undergoing cardioversion, thera-
peutic anticoagulation should be established before 
cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks 
afterwards without interruption to prevent  
thromboembolism.2–7
1 C-LD 3. In patients with AF in whom cardioversion is deferred 
due to LAA thrombus detected on precardioversion 
imaging, therapeutic anticoagulation should be insti-
tuted for at least 3 to 6 weeks, after which imaging 
should be repeated before cardioversion.1,8
2b B-NR 4. In patients with AF and previous LAAO who are not 
on anticoagulation, imaging evaluation to assess the 
adequacy of LAAO and exclude device-related throm-
bosis before cardioversion may be reasonable.9–19
2b C-LD 5. In patients with AF and previous LAAO with residual 
leak, pericardioversion anticoagulation may be  
considered and continued thereafter.9–11,20
2b C-LD 6. In patients with reported AF duration of <48 hours 
(not in the setting of cardiac surgery) and who are 
not on anticoagulation, precardioversion imaging to 
exclude intracardiac thrombus may be considered 
ins those who are at elevated thromboembolic risk 
(CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 or equivalent).21,22
2b C-LD 7 . In patients with low thromboembolic risks  
(CHA2DS2-VASc 0-1 or equivalent) and AF duration  
of <12 hours, the benefit of precardioversion imaging 
or pericardioversion anticoagulation is uncertain  
given the low incidence of pericardioversion  
thromboembolic events in this population.21,22
Synopsis
Thromboembolic risks and considerations of antico-
agulation apply to both pharmacological cardioversion 
and electrical cardioversion.23,24 Thromboembolic risks 
in the setting of acute cardioversion relate to preexist-
ing thrombus, change in atrial mechanical function with 
restoration of sinus rhythm, atrial stunning postcardio-
version, and transient prothrombotic state.2,25 DOACs 
are alternatives to VKAs as thromboprophylaxis in the 
setting of cardioversion.26–29 Given additional favorable 
attributes of rapid time to therapeutic efficacy, reliabil-
ity of maintenance of therapeutic efficacy, and ease 
of continuation, DOACs may be preferentially consid-
ered over VKAs for patients with AF planned for car-
dioversion barring contraindications to DOAC therapy. 
Precardioversion imaging is prudent for patients with 
AF who have previously undergone LAAO and are not 
on anticoagulation.9,10,14–16, 19 Thromboembolic risks for 
patients with <48 hours of AF were not homogenous 
but, rather, varied by a patient’s risk profile for throm-
boembolic complications (as defined by risk scores in 
specific studies) and duration of AF.21,22 More nuanced 
consideration of a patient’s thromboembolic risks in the 
setting of cardioversion for AF may integrate a patient’s 
substrate for atrial myopathy and risks for thromboem-
bolism instead of strict dependence on the previously 
used 48-hour duration threshold.Recommendations for Prevention of Thromboembolism in the Setting

 1. Early experience with both pharmacological and then 
electrical cardioversion of AF led to the observation 
that thromboembolism was less frequent in patients 
who were chronically anticoagulated than those who 
were not.30 This led to an empiric recommendation 
for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion 
in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE 
(Assessment of Cardioversion Using Tranesophageal 
Echocardiography) study of patients with >2 days’ 
duration of AF.31 Precardioversion anticoagulation of 
at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either ther-
apeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs.26–28  
Cardiac computed tomography, particularly with 
delayed contrast-enhanced image acquisition proto-
col, has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to 
exclude intracardiac thrombus.32–34 2. Rationales for establishment of therapeutic anti-
coagulation before cardioversion and continuation 
for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion 
for AF are driven by elevated thromboembolic 
risks,6,7,35 high early recurrence of AF,36 and obser-
vation of atrial dysfunction2–5 during this period. 
Thromboembolic risks are elevated around the 
time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days 
after cardioversion.6,7 The observation of spontane-
ous echocardiographic contrast in association with 
atrial dysfunction on TEE after cardioversion raised 
mechanistic concerns for atrial stunning in the set-
ting of cardioversion,2,3 with recovery of mechanical 
atrial systole over the ensuing 1 month.4,5 Rapidity 
of recovery of mechanical atrial systole may be 
influenced by clinical variables,37 duration of the

 3. In patients with AF, detection of intracardiac 
thrombus should prompt cancellation of planned 
cardioversion and institution of therapeutic anti-
coagulation in anticoagulant-naïve patients. 
Detection of intracardiac thrombus in patients 
already on anticoagulation should prompt 
assessment of compliance, dosing appropriate-
ness, drug absorption, and drug interactions. In 
patients with thrombus detected despite already 
being anticoagulated, potential reasons should 
be investigated, such as nonadherence and 
drug interaction, which may cause subtherapeu-
tic levels. Switching to an alternate anticoagu-
lant can be considered, although the benefit is 
uncertain. In anticoagulant-naïve patients, 61.2% 
had resolution of thrombus on follow-up TEE 
performed 3 to 12 weeks after initiation of 
VKA in the CLOT-AF (Retrospective Registry

had resolution of thrombus on follow-up TEE

oxaban in the X-TRA (Exploring the Efficacy of

computed tomography32–34) is generally pursued 
after at least 3 to 6 weeks of therapeutic antico-
agulation to assess for resolution of intracardiac 
thrombus before reconsidering cardioversion.1,8
 4. In the subset of patients who have undergone 
surgical or pLAAO procedures, inadequate occlu-
sion may be seen acutely during the procedure 
or delayed after the procedure.9–14 Inadequate 
LAAO has been associated with elevated risks for 
thromboembolism.9–11 Device-related thrombosis, 
reported in patients with pLAAO devices,15–19 has 
also been associated with elevated stroke/sys-
temic embolism.15–18 Imaging with TEE or cardiac 
computed tomography can assess adequacy of 
LAAO, residual leak, and device-related thrombo-
sis.39–41 In the setting of transesophageal echocar-
diographic imaging before electrical cardioversion, 
device-related thrombus was detected in 2.7% (4 
of 148 patients) of a small multicenter retrospec-
tive analysis of patients with Watchman LAAO 
device.20 These 4 patients were treated with oral 
anticoagulation and after 6 to 8 weeks, on con-
firmation of thrombus resolution by repeat TEE, 
underwent successful electrical cardioversion.20 5. Data are limited to guide pericardioversion antico-
agulation in patients with LAAO. In the broader (not 
limited to cardioversion) context, residual leak ≤5 
mm by computed tomography after LAAO by sur-
gical ligation has been associated with particularly 
elevated stroke/system embolism risks (especially 
in the absence of anticoagulation)9 and similarly for 
residual leak <5 mm by TEE post-Lariat.10 A large 
analysis that stratified National Cardiovascular 
Data Registry LAAO registry Watchman 2.5 device 
patients by transesophageal echocardiographic 
observation of residual leak (none, ≤5 mm, >5 
mm) at 45 days, found ≤5 mm residual leak to 
be common (13 258 of 51 333 patients; 25.8%) 
and associated with modestly higher incidence of 
thromboembolic events over 1-year follow-up com-
pared with no leak.11 OAC use was more frequent 
in patients with large (>5 mm) residual leak.11 
Data specific to the setting of cardioversion are 
further limited. The largest to date is a retrospec-
tive multicenter study of 148 Watchman LAAO 
device patients who underwent electrical cardio-
version after precardioversion exclusion of intra-
cardiac thrombus or large residual leak (≥5 mm in 
this study) by TEE.20 No thromboembolic events 
were observed within 6 weeks of cardioversion, 
in recipients or nonrecipients of pericardioversion 
anticoagulation.20 However, detection of thrombo-
embolic events may be limited by study’s sample 
size. Pericardioversion antithrombotic regimen was 
at the discretion of the treating physicians,20 and 
the relationship of anticoagulation with presence/
absence of small residual leak was not reported. 
Considerations for anticoagulation may also vary 
based on specific surgical or pLAAO procedures 
and devices.
 6. The safety of cardioversion without further assess-
ment or previous anticoagulation in patients with 
AF duration of <48 hours has been challenged. In 
addition to concerns for underestimation of actual 
duration of episode and burden due to potential 
for asymptomatic occurrence of AF, emerging data 
demonstrate that thromboembolic risks in patients 
with <48 hours of AF were not homogenously 
low. Time to cardioversion >12 hours has been 
reported as an independent predictor for thrombo-
embolic complications.21 A single-center observa-
tional study of patients undergoing cardioversion 
for AF of <48 hours duration did not observe 
thromboembolic events in patients with CHA2DS2-
VASc score of 0 or 1 or patients with postoperative 
AF but noted differential thromboembolic rates in 
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2.42 Larger studies simi-
larly demonstrated that among patients with <48 
hours of AF, postcardioversion thromboembolic 
risks increased with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc

Synopsis
Electrical cardioversion is a strategy for acute rhythm 
control. Compared with pharmacological cardiover-
sion alone, electrical cardioversion with synchronized 
direct current cardioversion is more rapid and effica-
cious for restoring sinus rhythm from AF.1,11,12 Given 
rapidity and efficacy, electrical cardioversion is the 
treatment of choice for patients with hemodynami-
cally unstable AF.
In hemodynamically stable patients with AF planned 
for acute rhythm control, electrical cardioversion can be 
performed as an initial strategy or after unsuccessful 
pharmacological cardioversion.2,6,13,14 Electrical cardio-
version is favored over pharmacological cardioversion 
when the patient is able to tolerate sedation, desires more immediate rhythm conversion, or has failed or not 
met candidacy for pharmacological cardioversion.
Although electrical cardioversion may achieve acute 
restoration of sinus rhythm, durability of sinus rhythm 
may be influenced by ongoing acute conditions, LA size, 
duration of the history of AF and/or specific episode, 
and comorbidities.14 In patients with a longer duration 
of AF, immediate recurrence of AF, a previous unsuc-
cessful electrical cardioversion, or a desire to employ all 
reasonable efforts to avoid an AF recurrence, pretreat-
ment antiarrhythmic drugs and subsequent continuation 
to facilitate success of acute cardioversion and promote 
maintenance of sinus rhythm postcardioversion6,8,9 may 
be pursued in the context of SDM with the patient. Opti-
mization of energy delivery, electrode vector, and reduc-
tion of transthoracic impedance with manual pressure 
augmentation may also improve success of electrical 
cardioversion.5–10
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In patients with hemodynamically unstable AF, 
immediate electrical cardioversion with synchro-
nized direct current cardioversion is the treatment 
of choice. Direct data on emergency cardioversion 
of hemodynamically unstable patients is limited 
because of the emergency circumstances of the 
clinical context. Data on direct current cardiover-
sion of AF in hemodynamically stable patients 
demonstrate high success rate of restoring sinus 
rhythm with direct current cardioversion.1,11,15–18 
Electrical cardioversion is rapid. Electrical cardio-
version alone is more effective than pharmacologi-
cal cardioversion alone.1,11,12
 2. Goals of rhythm control are summarized in Section 
8.1 (“Goals of Therapy With Rhythm Control”). 
Real-world data support both electrical cardio-
version and pharmacological cardioversion as 
acceptable, safe, and efficacious methods for 
acute rhythm control.6,13,14 Electrical cardioversion 
is more effective than pharmacological cardiover-
sion alone1,11 but involves the trade-off of requiring 
sedation.19 In patients with hemodynamically stable 
AF of recent onset, the RAFF2 (Electrical versus 
pharmacological cardioversion for emergency 
department patients with acute atrial fibrillation) 
study demonstrated high success of restoration of 
sinus rhythm with either an upfront electrical car-
dioversion strategy or a stepwise strategy with ini-
tial pharmacological cardioversion and then direct 
current cardioversion if the pharmacological inter-
vention did not restore sinus rhythm.2 In patients 
with unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion, 
instead of switching to another antiarrhythmic drug 
(and with concerns for potentiation of adverse 
effects such as QT prolongation or bradycardia), 
electrical cardioversion should be pursued as next

with hemodynamically stable AF, electrical cardio-
version is favored over pharmacological cardiover-
sion when the patient is able to tolerate sedation, 
desires more immediate rhythm conversion, or has 
failed or not met candidacy for pharmacological 
cardioversion. Monitoring and preparedness dur-
ing and after electrical cardioversion include 
monitoring for rare chronotropic, hemodynamic, 
or thromboembolic complications, and the effects 
of anesthesia administered during electrical 
cardioversion.6,13,14,20–22
 3. Unsynchronized or inappropriately synchronized 
cardioversion can induce VF if the shock energy is 
delivered during the vulnerable period, the inscrip-
tion of the T wave.3,23–25 Therefore, electrical car-
dioversion for AF should be synchronized with 
the QRS complex. The synchronization feature 
needs to be turned on or confirmed that it is on; in 
patients who require multiple shocks, the synchro-
nization feature must be manually activated and/or 
confirmed before each shock attempt. Visual con-
firmation of synchronization to QRS is important to 
detect inappropriate synchronization and ensure 
appropriate synchronization.
 4. An earlier small, multicenter, prospective random-
ized study demonstrated higher efficacy of initial 
electrical cardioversion with a biphasic waveform 
instead of monophasic waveform.4 A more contem-
porary single-centered, randomized study of 279 
patients who were randomized to synchronized 
direct current cardioversion with biphasic wave-
form with either upfront maximum-fixed energy or 
strategy of low-escalating energy found higher first 
shock success with maximum-fixed energy (75% 
compared with 34% for low-escalating energy 
group).5 In the contemporary RAFF2 study of 
patients with hemodynamically stable AF of recent 
onset, the upfront electrical cardioversion group 
with initial biphasic 200 J shock (and up to 3 con-
secutive shocks allowed, with higher energy per-
mitted for subsequent shocks) had conversion to 
sinus rhythm in 176 of 192 (92%) patients in this 
upfront electrical cardioversion shock-only group.2
 5. A previous study of patients with persistent AF 
(median AF duration, 5 months) undergoing direct 
current cardioversion with escalation of energy 
found the anterior-posterior orientation of the elec-
trode vector more successful at restoring sinus 
rhythm than an anterior-lateral vector,7 while a sub-
sequent study of patients with recently diagnosed 
AF (≥3 hours and <7 days) undergoing direct cur-
rent cardioversion using biphasic upfront 200 J 
showed similar success rates with electrode vec-
tors in either anterior-posterior or anterior-lateral 
orientation.2 Taken together, when energy output is optimized as biphasic and maximal output and 
the AF is of recent onset, either vector orientation 
may be reasonable, but for patients with longer 
duration of AF, the anterior-posterior orientation of 
electrode vector may be favorable.2 Manual pres-
sure augmentation26 or administration of antiar-
rhythmic drugs as pretreatment (Section 8.2.3, 
“Pharmacological Cardioversion”)6,8,9 may also 
facilitate electrical cardioversion.
 6. Increased body weight has been associated with 
reduced success of electrical cardioversion.27 In 
a small randomized clinical study, use of paddles, 
manual pressure augmentation (using electrically 
silent objects as insulator), and further escalation 
of electrical energy improved success of electri-
cal cardioversion of obese patients with AF,10 and 
the benefits of these maneuvers may mechanisti-
cally relate to overcoming increased transthoracic 
impedance. Other alternatives in refractory cases 
include the use of 2 defibrillators simultaneously, 
effectively doubling the delivered energy.

2a C-LD 1. For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion  
is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardiover-
sion for those who are hemodynamically stable or in 
situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred 
but cannot be performed.1
2a A 2. For patients with AF, ibutilide2,3 is reasonable for 
pharmacological cardioversion for patients without 
depressed L V function (L VEF <40%).
2a A 3. For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is rea-
sonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although 
time to conversion is generally longer than with other 
agents (8-12 hours).4–8
2a A 4. For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the 
setting of a hospital, the “pill-in-the-pocket” (PITP) 
approach with a single oral dose of flecainide9–11 or 
propafenone,10–14 with a concomitant atrioventricular 
nodal blocking agent,15 is reasonable for pharmaco-
logical cardioversion if previously tested in a moni-
tored setting.16–18
2b B-R 5. For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide 
may be considered for pharmacological cardioversion 
when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or 
not preferred.19

Pharmacological cardioversion is indicated for patients 
with new-onset or persistent AF that is hemodynamically 
stable, or in rare instances when electrical cardioversion  
is desired but contraindicated. Ibutilide works rapidly 
for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associ-
ated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de 
pointes, particularly in patients with HFrEF.2,3,20,21 Data

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationstable patients with AF who presented to an 
emergency department, the incidence of success-
ful cardioversion was higher in the direct current 
cardioversion group (78.2%) than in those who 
underwent pharmacological conversion (59.2%) 
or those for whom a “wait-and-watch” approach 
(37 .9%) was used (P<0.001).1 Compared with the 
“wait-and-watch” strategy, the ORs for conversion 
to sinus rhythm for direct current cardioversion and 
pharmacological cardioversion were 6.00 (95% 
CI, 3.38-10.66) and 2.47 (1.45-4.20), respectively 
(P<0.001). Due to the potential greater efficacy 
of direct current cardioversion compared with 
that of pharmacological cardioversion, and due to 
the need for rapid successful conversion to sinus 
rhythm, immediate electrical cardioversion is gen-
erally the favored option, yet some patients may not 
be candidates (eg, cannot undergo anesthesia), for 
whom pharmacological options are available.31
 2. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled stud-
ies have established the efficacy of ibutilide2,3 for 
conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, with AF con-
version rates of about 30% (compared with 2% 
in placebo groups).2,3 The efficacy of ibutilide is 
greater for AFL (conversion rates, 38%-63%) than 
for AF.2,3 Ibutilide terminates AF rapidly, with most patients converting to sinus rhythm within 30 to 
90 minutes (Table 22). Ibutilide is associated with 
a risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades 
de pointes. The incidence of torsades de pointes 
associated with ibutilide is higher in patients with 
reduced L VEF than in those with normal L VEF,2,3 
and the risk seems particularly high in patients with 
severely depressed L VEF.20 HFrEF is an indepen-
dent risk factor for ibutilide-associated torsades 
de pointes.3,21 Therefore, ibutilide is best avoided 
in patients with L VEF ≤40%. Of note, studies have 
shown that a magnesium infusion immediately 
before administration of ibutilide may mitigate 
the risk of torsades de pointes and excessive QT 
prolongation.32,33
 3. Multiple randomized studies have found intrave-
nous amiodarone to be effective for conversion of 
AF to sinus rhythm.4–7 A meta-analysis of random-
ized, placebo-controlled studies reported relative 
risks of sinus rhythm associated with intravenous 
amiodarone at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours of 
1.23 (P=0.022) and 1.44 (P<0.001), respectively.8 
However, pharmacological cardioversion of AF with 
intravenous amiodarone requires 8 to 12 hours, 
compared with a much shorter response time with 
ibutilide (Table 22).

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 4. Single oral doses of flecainide9–11 and propafe-
none10–14 are effective for conversion of AF 
to sinus rhythm, with 3- to 4-hour conversion 
rates of 58% to 68% for flecainide (compared 
with 18%-29% for placebo) and 45% to 57% 
for propafenone (compared with 17%-29% for 
placebo) (Table 22). A beta blocker or nondihy-
dropyridine calcium channel blocker is generally 
administered at least 30 minutes before a dose of 
flecainide or propafenone to prevent 1:1 atrioven-
tricular conduction during AFL.15 The PITP strat-
egy was studied in 268 patients with stable AF 
of recent onset who presented to the emergency 
department.16 Patients received single-dose oral 
flecainide or propafenone, and those who were 
successfully treated (n=210) were discharged 
with a plan for the PITP approach. In the 15±5-
month follow-up period, single-dose flecainide or 
propafenone was successful in 94% of episodes. 
However, the incidence of adverse effects is not 
insignificant (6%-17%).16–18 In view of this, and 
because in most studies, most patients received 
the first dose in the hospital before taking it as 
an outpatient, the PITP strategy should only be 
used for highly selected patients and after it first 
has been observed to be safe and effective in an 
inpatient setting.17,18,34
 5. Intravenous procainamide was shown to be more 
effective than placebo for conversion of AF to 
sinus rhythm (conversion rates at 1 hour, 69% 
versus 38%; P =0.012) in a randomized, double-
blind study of 114 patients.19 However, intrave-
nous procainamide is less effective than ibutilide 
for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (conversion 
rates, 14% versus 76%; P =0.001).22 The effi-
cacy of procainamide for conversion of AF to 
sinus rhythm was similarly inferior to that of ibu-
tilide in an analysis of pooled data.23 In addition, 
intravenous procainamide is associated with a 
relatively high incidence of clinically significant 
hypotension (5%-12%)19,23 and can exacerbate

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationbe well-tolerated. A Cochrane database meta-analysis 
of randomized studies5 reported sotalol to be associated 
with an increase in all-cause mortality (RR, 2.23 [95% 
CI, 1.03-4.81]). Low-dose amiodarone is more effec-
tive than sotalol and Class IC agents for maintenance 
of sinus rhythm; but, in view of its adverse effects and 
multiple drug interactions, is best reserved for patients 
for whom other antiarrhythmic drugsare ineffective, not 
preferred, or contraindicated. However, amiodarone and 
dofetilide are options for maintenance of sinus rhythm 
for patients with HFrEF, as they are effective,1,2 and most 
other drugs are contraindicated.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In subanalyses of randomized trials, dofetilide1 and 
amiodarone2 have been shown to be effective for 
maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF 
who have HF. Most antiarrhythmic agents, except 
amiodarone and dofetilide, are contraindicated in 
patients with HFrEF due to worsening of HF and/
or increased mortality. Sotalol is best avoided in 
most patients with HFrEF, because most patients 
with HFrEFare already taking a beta blocker for 
mortality reduction, and the addition of a second 
beta blocker (sotalol) is unlikely to be well-tolerated. 
Therefore, although amiodarone is associated with 
a wide range of adverse effects and many clinically 
important drug interactions, amiodarone is often 
used as a first-line agent for maintenance of sinus 
rhythm in patients with AF and HFrEF. Dofetilide is 
also an option for this indication. Patients undergo-
ing initiation or reloading of dofetilide29,30 should be 
admitted for at least 3 days to a health care facility 
that can provide calculations of CrCl, continuous 
electrocardiographic monitoring, and availability of 
cardiac resuscitation.
 2. Randomized, controlled studies and a comprehen-
sive Cochrane database analysis have established 
the efficacy of flecainide3–5 and propafenone5–11 for 
maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In 
the Flec-SL (Short-term versus long-term antiar-
rhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion of atrial 
fibrillation) trial,4 flecainide prevented episodes of 
paroxysmal AF in 31% of patients over 4 months 
compared with 9% in the placebo group (0.013). 
Sustained-release propafenone 425, 325, and 225 
mg twice daily extended the median time to the occur-
rence of AF, AFL, or supraventricular tachycardia 
(SVT) compared with placebo (>300, 291, and 112 
days versus 41 days, P <0.001, for all propafenone 
doses versus placebo).8 Patients with previous MI or 
significant structural heart disease (scar or fibrosis) 
should not take flecainide of propafenone,26,27 and 
individuals taking flecainide or propafenone should 
be concomitantly taking an atrioventricular nodal 
blocking agent to reduce the risk of 1:1 AFL.12 3. Randomized, controlled studies13–15 and a compre-
hensive Cochrane database analysis5 have estab-
lished the efficacy of dronedarone for maintenance 
of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. The combined 
analysis (n=1237) of EURIDIS (European Trial 
in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving 
Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm) 
and ADONIS (American-Australian-African Trial 
with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter 
Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm) 
reported longer median times to AF recurrence in 
dronedarone groups versus placebo (EURIDIS: 96 
versus 41 days; P=0.001; ADONIS 158 versus 59 
days; P=0.002).14
 4. Randomized, controlled studies and a compre-
hensive Cochrane database analysis5 have estab-
lished the efficacy of dofetilide for maintenance of 
sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In the SAFIRE-D 
(Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation Investigative 
Research on Dofetilide) study,1,16 the probabil-
ity of remaining in sinus rhythm at 1 year was 
higher in patients receiving dofetilide 500 μg twice 
daily compared with placebo (0.58 versus 0.25; 
P<0.001). Patients undergoing initiation or reload-
ing of dofetilide29,30 should be admitted for at least 
3 days to a health care facility that can provide cal-
culations of CrCl, continuous electrocardiographic 
monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation.
 5. Multiple randomized, controlled studies have 
established the efficacy of amiodarone for main-
tenance of sinus rhythm in AF and have shown 
amiodarone to be superior to other antiarrhyth-
mic agents. In SAFE-T (Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial 
Fibrillation Efficacy Trial), amiodarone was superior 
to sotalol and placebo with respect to median time 
to recurrence of AF (487 versus 74 versus 6 days, 
respectively; P<0.001, for amiodarone versus pla-
cebo and amiodarone versus sotalol).17 In CTAF 
(Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation), AF recurrence 
rates at 16 months were 35% in the amiodarone 
group and 63% in those randomized to combined 
propafenone or sotalol (P<0.001).19 However, the 
adverse effects profile of amiodarone is oner-
ous. Amiodarone is associated with a wide range 
of adverse effects, including pulmonary fibrosis, 
hypo- or hyperthyroidism, elevated transaminases, 
and more rarely hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, 
changes in skin pigmentation, peripheral neuropa-
thy, sinus bradycardia, QT interval prolongation and 
torsades de pointes, corneal microdeposits, and 
rarely optic neuropathy.24 In addition, amiodarone is 
associated with many clinically relevant drug inter-
actions.31 Therefore, amiodarone is best reserved 
for patients who do not respond to other recom-
mended antiarrhythmic agents or for whom other 
antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 6. Randomized, controlled studies and a comprehen-
sive Cochrane database analysis5 have established 
the efficacy of sotalol6,7,10,17 ,18 for maintenance of 
sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In SAFE-T, the 
median time to AF recurrence was 74 days in the 
sotalol group, compared with 6 days for placebo 
(P<0.001).16 A Cochrane database meta-analysis 
of 5 randomized studies totaling 1882 patients 
with AF5 reported sotalol to be associated with an 
increase in all-cause mortality (RR, 2.23 [95% CI, 
1.03-4.81]). However, this study included patients 
with advanced HF, and sotalol may still have a role 
in patients with preserved heart function. Patients 
undergoing initiation or reloading of oral sotalol 
should be admitted for at least 3 days to a health 
care facility that can provide calculations of CrCl, 
continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and 
cardiac resuscitation. A recent FDA-approved 
intravenous sotalol formulation can be used to 
evaluate the drug safety and tolerability within 6 
hours and thus may reduce cost and length of stay, 
although the data are limited to a small sample size 
and very selected population.32
 7 . In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial),26,27 the Vaughan Williams class IC antiarrhythmic agents 
flecainide and encainide were associated with an 
increased mortality rate in patients with recent MI; 
most patients also had L VEF <50%.26 In the con-
tinuation of the study (CAST-II), the class IC agent 
moricizine also increased the mortality rate within 
the first 14 days of treatment.33 In CASH (Cardiac 
Arrest Study Hamburg),34 propafenone was associ-
ated with worse outcomes and increased mortality 
in a population of cardiac arrest survivors, most of 
whom had structural heart disease. Thus, IC agents 
are best avoided in patients with AF who have a 
previous MI or significant structural heart disease, 
including HFrEF, due to the risk of worsening HF 
and increased mortality.
 8. ANDROMEDA (Antiarrhythmic Trial with 
Dronedarone in Moderate to Severe CHF 
Evaluating Morbidity Decrease)28 was a random-
ized, double-blind placebo-controlled study that 
tested the hypothesis that dronedarone would 
reduce the rate of hospitalization attributable to 
HF and possibly reduce mortality by reducing the 
incidence of arrhythmic death. The study enrolled 
patients who were hospitalized with new or wors-
ening HF and who had at least 1 episode of NYHA

reported that, contrary to the study’s hypothesis,

(8.1% versus 3.8%; HR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.07-4.25];

8.3.2. Inpatient Initiation of Antiarrhythmic Agents
Recommendations for Inpatient Initiation of Antiarrhythmic Agents
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 A 1. Patients with AF who are initiating, increasing the  
dose of, or reinitiating dofetilide therapy should be 
admitted for a minimum of 3 days to a facility that can 
provide continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 
calculations of CrCl, and cardiac resuscitation, given 
the potential for proarrhythmia.1–7
2a B-R 2. In patients with AF, it is reasonable to initiate sotalol 
therapy in a facility that can provide continuous  
electrocardiographic monitoring, calculations of CrCl, 
and cardiac resuscitation, given the potential for  
proarrhythmia and bradycardia.4,8–10
2a B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are initiating PITP dosing 
of flecainide and propafenone with concomitant 
atrioventricular nodal blocking drugs, it is reasonable 
to receive the first dose in a facility that can provide 
continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, given  
the potential for proarrhythmia.9–13
Synopsis
Pharmacological rhythm control is an alternative to cath-
eter ablation in appropriately selected patients. However, 
many antiarrhythmic agents have a paradoxic risk of 
proarrhythmia and require close monitoring on initiation. 
Dofetilide and sotalol confer a relatively high risk of tor-
sades de pointes given they prolong the QT interval, and 
this can occur early during initiation. As such, patients 
need to be admitted and closely monitored when start-
ing or reinitiating dofetilide, as well as for increasing the 
dosage. Many practitioners choose to initiate sotalol in an 
inpatient setting given it can cause torsades de pointes; 
furthermore, unlike dofetilide, it can also cause bradyar-
rhythmia. Amiodarone, flecainide, and propafenone can 
be started in the outpatient setting. Because PITP with 
class IC (with concomitant atrioventricular nodal block-
ers) can cause brady- or tachyarrhythmias, the first at-
tempt during an acute episode of AF may be performed 
in a monitored environment if a high dose is used.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Dofetilide, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is a 
selective IKr blocker that also blocks late Na+ cur-
rent (INaL) and poses a high risk for torsades de 
pointes. The SAFIRE-D (Symptomatic Atrial 
Fibrillation Investigative Research on Dofetilide) 
study investigated dofetilide in cardioverting and maintaining sinus rhythm in 325 patients with AF 
or AFL who underwent a minimum 3-day hospi-
talization.1 Of 241 patients randomized to dofeti-
lide, 10 patients had QTc prolongation within the 
first 3 days, with 2 episodes of torsades de pointes 
degenerating to VF. In a substudy of the AFFIRM 
trial, 1 of 12 patients on dofetilide experienced 
torsades de pointes.3 One retrospective cohort of 
378 patients found no significant differences in 
the incidence of torsades de pointes during inpa-
tient initiation of dofetilide and sotalol (1.3% versus 
1.2%).4 One systematic review found a 1% to 10% 
incidence of torsades de pointes in patients tak-
ing dofetilide, highest in patients with HFrEF and 
taking higher than recommended (or not renally 
adjusted) doses.14 In 2 randomized RCTs from 
the DIAMOND (Management of Hyperkalemia in 
Subjects Receiving Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
System Inhibitor Medications for Heart Failure with 
Reduced Ejection Fraction) population, in which 
all patients were hospitalized for at least 3 days 
after dofetilide was initiated, torsades de pointes 
occurred in 25 of 762 patients (3.3%)5 and 7 
of 749 patients (0.9%),7 respectively, with most 
occurring within the first 3 days of dosing. In the 
DIAMOND AF substudy of these trials,6 torsades 
de pointes occurred in 4 dofetilide-treated patients 
with AF (1.6%).
 2. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic with beta-block-
ing properties. Its action potential prolongation 
(due to the IKr-blocking properties of the d isomer 
in concert with INaL blockade) predisposes patients 
to torsades de pointes. One meta-analysis dem-
onstrated that sotalol, compared with placebo or 
no treatment, was associated with a significantly 
higher all-cause mortality rate (RR, 2.23; 1882 
patients in 5 RCTs) and proarrhythmia (RR, 3.55; 
2989 patients in 12 RCTs).18 The SAFE-T trial 
randomized 665 patients to amiodarone, sotalol, 
or placebo, all initiated in the outpatient setting 
(sotalol at 80 mg twice daily for the first week 
and 160 mg twice daily subsequently).15 Fifteen 
deaths occurred in the sotalol group, 8 of which 
were sudden, with a nonsignificant mortality ratio 
of 1.8 compared with placebo. In 1 retrospective 
cohort of 120 patients undergoing sotalol initiation 
as an inpatient, 2 of 7 had torsades de pointes; 
20 patients developed significant bradyarrhyth-
mias necessitating dose reductions, and 3 patients 
required permanent pacing.8 Intravenous sotalol 
was introduced in the United States in 2015 and 
reaches therapeutic levels rapidly and with easier 
dose titration to QTc levels and clinical response. 
As such, it may be an option for more expedient 
inpatient initiation (obviating the need for a 3-day 
initiation period).16

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 3. The PITP strategy—a high dose of a class IC agent 
(flecainide 200-300 mg or propafenone 450-600 
mg, with an atrioventricular nodal blocker)—can be 
considered for patients who experience infrequent 
episodes of symptomatic AF and do not prefer 
chronic antiarrhythmic therapy. Class IC agents are 
generally administered with concomitantly atrioven-
tricular nodal blocking agents to mitigate risk of rap-
idly conducting AFL. Because of the risk of adverse 
effects and proarrhythmia with high-dose IC agents, 
inpatient initiation of PITP has been studied. In 1 
trial evaluating the safety of outpatient PITP ther-
apy after initiation as an inpatient, 58 of 268 (22%) 
patients experienced transient hypotension, 1:1 and 
2:1 AFL, and symptomatic bradycardia.9 In a pro-
spective study of 43 patients who presented to the 
emergency department for initiation of PITP,10 sinus rhythm was restored in 30 patients; 13 patients 
remained in AF, and/or had symptomatic hypoten-
sion, converted to rapid AFL requiring cardioversion, 
or experienced a syncopal conversion pause. In a 
retrospective cohort13 study of 273 patients initiat-
ing PITP (62% inpatient), 7 patients experienced 
significant adverse events, including syncope, symp-
tomatic bradycardia/hypotension, and organization 
to 1:1 AFL—2 of 7 of these patients initiated PITP 
as an inpatient, and 2 patients required permanent 
pacemakers for bradycardia.

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationAmiodarone
Recommendations for follow-up monitoring for patients 
taking oral amiodarone are provided in Table 24. Amio-
darone contains 37% iodine by weight and is therefore 
associated with thyroid abnormalities in 2% to 24% of 
patients.1 In 1 study, the median time to onset of ami-
odarone-induced hypothyroidism was 183 days, with a 
median onset of hyperthyroidism of 720 days.2 Oral ami-
odarone may also provoke elevations in hepatic trans-
aminases and, rarely, hepatotoxicity.3
Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity, most com-
monly in the form of interstitial lung disease or hypersen-
sitivity syndrome,4 in 1% to 2% of patients and is fatal in 
approximately 10% of cases. Consequently, a chest x-ray is 
recommended at baseline and when there is a clinical sus-
picion for pulmonary toxicity.4,5 Pulmonary function testing, 
including diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, can reveal 
relatively early changes in pulmonary function that may be 
attributable to amiodarone-associated pulmonary toxicity; 
however, the sensitivity of the test for routine screening of 
drug-induced lung toxicity in general is uncertain.4–7
In patients who develop unexplained cough and dys-
pnea while taking amiodarone, a chest CT scan can be 
helpful for diagnosis.5
Corneal microdeposits (epithelial keratopathy) are 
common, but visual abnormalities and light sensitivity are 
rare.8 Therefore, an ophthalmologic examination is rea-
sonable only if visual abnormalities develop. Amiodarone 
has also been associated with neurological toxicity, par-
ticularly peripheral neuropathy.
Although less common than class III antiarrhythmic 
agents, oral amiodarone may cause torsades de pointes9; 
1 analysis estimated the incidence to be 0.7%.10
Other Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Recommendations for follow-up of other antiarrhyth-
mic agents used for management of AF are provided 
in Table 25.Dofetilide
Dofetilide is a potent inhibitor of IKr, augments INa-L, and 
is associated with torsades de pointes.9 The incidence of 
torsades de pointes associated with dofetilide ranges from 
0.9% to 3.3%.11,12 However, the incidence can be substan-
tially higher if the dofetilide dose is not properly adjusted 
for kidney function. Patients undergoing initiation or re-
loading of dofetilide are generally admitted for at least 3 
days to a health care facility that can provide calculations 
of CrCl, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and 
cardiac resuscitation. After discharge on a stable dose of 
these drugs, a 12-lead ECG, and levels for serum magne-
sium, potassium, and creatinine are recommended every 3 
to 6 months for assessment of QTc interval duration, elec-
trolyte balance, and renal function, and more frequently for 
patients concomitantly taking other QT interval-prolonging 
drugs or with changing kidney function, to minimize the 
risk of drug-associated torsades de pointes.
Dronedarone
Rare cases of severe liver injury have been reported in 
association with dronedarone. These cases have oc-
curred 4.5 to 6 months after initiation of dronedarone 
therapy, although 1 case of hepatotoxicity was reported 
as early as 2 days after initiation of dronedarone (and 
was ultimately fatal a few days later),13 although a severe 
case of dronedarone-associated toxic hepatitis occurred 
9 months after initiation of therapy.14
Ibutilide
Ibutilide may prolong the QT interval and cause torsades 
de pointes15–22 and therefore continuous electrocardio-
graphic monitoring is recommended during infusion and 
for 4 hours after completion of ibutilide infusion. Ibuti-
lide is associated with nonsustained ventricular tachy-
cardia (VT), QT interval prolongation, and torsades de 
pointes. The incidence of nonsustained VT has been re-
ported to be as high as 8.3%.23 Torsades de pointes oc-
curs in approximately 2% to 7% of patients,15–22 but the

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationincidence increases substantially in patients with de-
pressed L VEF.22 Most reported cases of ibutilide-associated  
nonsustained VT and torsades de pointes have oc-
curred within 30 minutes after the last dose; torsades 
de pointes has rarely been reported as late as 2.5 hours 
after an ibutilide infusion.22 QTc intervals generally return 
to baseline within 2 to 3 hours after a dose.
The risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes is 
higher in patients with hypokalemia and/or hypomag-
nesemia. Hypokalemia has been reported to be present 
in 17% to 70% of patients who have developed drug-
induced torsades de pointes.24–27 Similarly, hypomagne-
semia has been reported to be a contributing factor to 
numerous published cases of drug-induced torsades de 
pointes.27–29 Therefore, maintenance of serum potassium 
and magnesium concentrations within the normal range 
is important before administration of ibutilide, and mag-
nesium supplementation may mitigate the risk of tors-
ades de pointes.
Procainamide
Intravenous procainamide is associated with hypotension 
in 5% to 12% of patients when used for management of 
AF,30,31 and BP monitoring is recommended. Intravenous 
procainamide is also associated with widening of the QRS complex and prolongation of the QT interval and 
may provoke proarrhythmia in the form of monomorphic 
VT32 and torsades de pointes.33
Sotalol
Sotalol is a potent inhibitor of IKr, augments INa-L, and is as-
sociated with torsades de pointes, with an incidence rang-
ing from 0.4% to 2.3%.34,35 Patients undergoing initiation or 
dose escalation of sotalol are often admitted for at least 3 
days to a health care facility that can provide calculations 
of CrCl, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and 
cardiac resuscitation. A new intravenous form of sotalol 
was recently FDA approved, which may obviate the need 
for 3-day admission. After discharge on a stable dose of 
these drugs, a 12-lead ECG, and levels of serum magne-
sium, potassium, and creatinine are recommended every 3 
to 6 months for assessment of QTc interval duration, elec-
trolyte balance, and renal function, and more frequently for 
patients concomitantly taking other QT interval-prolonging 
drugs or with changing kidney function, to minimize the risk 
of drug-associated torsades de pointes.

Synopsis
Catheter ablation has become an established therapy for 
AF because of multiple RCTs and evidence from large 
registries and continues to evolve as new technologies 
are developed. Previous professional society documents 
have provided different recommendations for catheter 
ablation dependent on whether AF was persistent or 
paroxysmal.25,40 More recent information has shown that 
ablation for AF is more effective than antiarrhythmic 
drugs for both persistent and paroxysmal AF and that 
earlier implementation of rhythm control strategies is an 
important factor for improving AF ablation success rat
es.4,35,41–44 As with all strategies for rhythm control of AF, 
impact on a patient’s goals of care and QOL should be 
the focus. For example, significantly reducing the fre-
quency and duration of AF episodes but not eliminating 
all future episodes of AF may represent a clinically im-
portant improvement. Although RCTs have mainly used 
younger patients (<70 years of age) who also experi-
ence the largest benefits, observational studies have 
reported improvement in QOL with catheter ablation in 
older patients.3–6,8,45–47

 1. In patients who have not responded to an antiar-
rhythmic drug due to a high burden of recurrent AF 
or adverse effects from the medication, RCTs have 
consistently demonstrated lower risk for recurrent 
symptomatic AF after ablation when compared with 
using another antiarrhythmic medication.1–10 As an 
example, in STOP-AF, patients who had failed ≥1 
antiarrhythmic drug (approximately 70% and 30% 
for 1 or 2 failed drugs, respectively) were random-
ized to either another antiarrhythmic drug or cath-
eter ablation. At 1 year follow-up, catheter ablation 
was associated with a treatment success rate of 
70% compared with 7% in the drug arm.10 Similarly, 
in the Thermo-cool (NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL 
Catheter for the Radiofrequency Ablation of 
Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) trial, 
patients with paroxysmal AF who had failed 1 anti-
arrhythmic medication were randomized to cath-
eter ablation or another antiarrhythmic drug. After

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationgroup were free from recurrent arrhythmia com-
pared with 16% in the antiarrhythmic drug group.8 
Finally, most recently, in the CABANA trial, 80% of 
patients were on an antiarrhythmic medication and 
thought to be candidates for AF ablation and were 
randomized to catheter ablation or continued anti-
arrhythmic therapy. Catheter ablation was associ-
ated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF 
(HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45-0.60]; P<0.001).4,28
 2. In selected patients with paroxysmal AF, ablation is 
a suitable first-line option. Several initial RCTs sug-
gested a decrease in recurrent AF or AF burden 
with catheter ablation when compared with antiar-
rhythmic drugs.16 More recent trials have shown a 
significant reduction in recurrent AF with catheter 
ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs. In a 
follow-up report of 1 study, after 3-year follow-up, 
catheter ablation continued to be associated with a 
significant decrease in recurrent atrial tachyarrhyth-
mias when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs 
(HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38-0.67]).14 More importantly, 
episodes of persistent AF developed in only 1.9% 
of patients randomized to catheter ablation com-
pared with 7 .4% of patients in the antiarrhythmic 
drug arm (HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13-0.70]).14 All of 
the studies that have evaluated catheter ablation 
as an initial strategy for rhythm control in patients 
with paroxysmal AF, although fairly standard exclu-
sion criteria were used, enrolled relatively young 
patients (average age approximately 60 years) 
who had relatively few comorbidities (if present, 
mainly hypertension).16
 3. AFL is most commonly due to the critical isthmus 
formed by the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid 
valve. More rarely, in patients who have not under-
gone previous ablation procedures atypical AFL 
or focal ATs can be observed. Catheter ablation of 
typical AFL is effective and relatively low risk.17–19 
In an older meta-analysis of AFL ablation stud-
ies, AFL ablation was associated with an acute 
success rate of 90% and a complication rate of 
2.6%.18 The occurrence of AF after AFL ablation 
was 34%, with a recurrence rate of 23% in those 
patients without a history of AF compared with 
53% in patients with a history of AF. By 5 years, 
AF developed in 60% to 70% of patients regard-
less of whether the patient had a history of AF 
before the AFL ablation. Little evidence is avail-
able in these studies for the clinical significance of 
AF after AFL ablation.
 4. AF can be associated with other atrial arrhyth-
mias, particularly AFL.20–22 During ablation for AF, 
ablation of previously documented or inducible 
sustained SVT or AFL is useful to reduce the likeli-
hood of recurrent arrhythmias.22–25 Although abla-
tion alone for AF in patients with both AF and AFL will reduce the likelihood of AFL, and ablation tar-
geting an inducible SVT in a patient with AF may 
reduce future AF, in both cases the likelihood of 
recurrent arrhythmias is high, although the actual 
recurrence rate will depend on the specific popu-
lation.17,18,25–27 ,48,49 Conversely, prophylactic catheter 
ablation of the CTI in patients without documented 
or inducible AFL likely has minimal benefit.50 
Alternatively, in 1 study, cryoballoon PVI as first-line 
treatment for AFL is equally effective compared 
with standard CTI ablation for preventing recur-
rence of atrial arrhythmia and better at preventing 
new-onset AF.51
 5. Several randomized trials have compared catheter 
ablation to AADs as first-line therapy for AF.11–13 
In the MANTRA-AF study, ablation and antiar-
rhythmic drugs as first-line therapy for paroxys-
mal AF was evaluated. Although no differences 
in AF were identified during the first 18 months, 
at 24-month follow-up, ablation was associated 
with a lower AF burden (ablation, 9% versus anti-
arrhythmic drugs, 18%; P=0.004).11 Subsequent 
studies have demonstrated similar results: In the 
EARL Y-AF (Early Aggressive Invasive Intervention 
for Atrial Fibrillation) study, at 1-year follow-up, 
recurrent atrial arrhythmias were identified in 
43% of the ablation group and 68% of the anti-
arrhythmic drug group (P<0.001), and in the 
STOP AF First (Cryoballoon Catheter Ablation in 
an Antiarrhythmic Drug Naive Paroxysmal Atrial 
Fibrillation) study, recurrent atrial arrhythmias were 
identified in 25% of the ablation group and 55% 
of the antiarrhythmic drug group (P<0.001).12,13 
Procedural complications were observed in 2% 
to 5% of patients in all 3 studies.11–13 Although 
AF burden was significantly reduced with abla-
tion compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in 
EARL Y-AF, AF burden was low with either strategy 
(percentage of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus 
antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%) and, in all 3 trials, the 
average age was ≤60 years.11–13 Although these 
trials enrolled patients with paroxysmal AF, recent 
studies have consistently found that catheter abla-
tion is more commonly used and also effective in 
patients with persistent AF, particularly if of rela-
tively recent onset (<1 year).28
 6. Catheter ablation for AF is a costly procedure yet 
appears to provide value by improving the symp-
toms of AF and patient QOL. Some of the initially 
higher costs of the ablation procedure may be 
offset by reductions in subsequent cardiovascular 
hospitalizations. Formal economic analyses have 
been performed alongside 2 randomized controlled 
clinical trials. Both trials showed higher costs and 
improved QOL during follow-up, with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $58 000 and €51 000

effectiveness of catheter ablation have reported 
more favorable results, but their results generally 
depended on assumptions that ablation reduced 
mortality, or ischemic stroke, or both, which have 
not been proven.
 7 . In most patients, continued untreated AF will lead 
to progression and higher AF burden associated 
with worse clinical outcomes.31–39 In patients with 
subclinical AF <24 hours, progression to overt AF 
or episodes >24 hours occurs at a rate of 8.8% 
per year, and those patients who develop AF are 
more likely to be hospitalized for HF.56 Several 
observational studies have reported AF progres-
sion may be improved by using a catheter-based 
ablation rhythm-control strategy.33–35,37 ,38 As an 
example, in 1 randomized trial that was stopped 
prematurely, in 255 patients with paroxysmal AF 
randomized to catheter ablation or antiarrhyth-
mic medication, freedom from persistent AF or 
AT was significantly higher with catheter ablation 
(ablation: 2.4%, versus antiarrhythmic medication, 
17 .5%, 1-sided P=0.0009).57 However, serious 
adverse events associated with the ablation were 
observed in 8% of patients.57 Despite the potential 
risks associated with catheter ablation, in a recent 
analysis of a large registry that specifically evalu-
ated asymptomatic patients, rhythm control was 
associated with an improvement in the composite 
outcome of cardiac death, ischemic stroke, and 
hospitalization for HF.58 The impact was largest in 
those patients who underwent catheter ablation for 
rhythm control, particularly in those with paroxys-
mal AF, LA diameters ≤50 mm,58 or higher stroke 
risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥3). In a post hoc anal-
ysis of EAST-AFNET 4, the magnitude of benefit 
from a rhythm-control strategy for reducing the pri-
mary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, 
stroke, or hospitalizations for HF or ACS was inde-
pendent of symptom status, and catheter ablation 
for rhythm control was used in approximately 20% 
of patients, whether symptomatic or not.59
8.4.1. Patient Selection
Patient selection is the first step and a critically impor-
tant step in deciding candidacy for catheter ablation.1–4 
Younger patients are likely to derive greater long-term 
benefit, including delaying AF progression. However, 
clinical trials have demonstrated improved cardiovascular 
outcomes with rhythm control, even with median ages in 
the 70s.5 Patients with minimal atrial enlargement have 
the best outcomes,6 whereas increased myocardial fi-
brosis7,8 and more persistent forms of AF are associated with higher rates of recurrence after ablation. Time from 
diagnosis to ablation is also associated with improved 
outcomes after ablation.9,10 Although the likelihood of 
recurrence of AF is 1 factor that should be considered, 
it is difficult to predict,11 and certain patients may derive 
even greater benefits from catheter ablation, such as in 
patients with HFrEF, who have been shown to have im-
proved functional status, L V function, and cardiovascular 
outcomes.12–14
In some patients, ablation should be avoided as it is 
unlikely to be successful due to overwhelming substrate 
or ongoing physiologic processes that either strongly 
perpetuate the risk of AF or make maintenance of 
sinus rhythm unlikely. These situations include but are 
not limited to advanced infiltrative cardiomyopathies like 
amyloid, severe mitral stenosis or regurgitation, and cor 
pulmonale.

mended as the primary lesion set for all patients 
unless a different specific trigger is identified.1–7

other endpoints beyond PVI such as noninducibility 
and ablation of additional anatomic ablation targets

Synopsis
Catheter ablation is now established as an effective op-
tion for rhythm control in patients with AF and AFL.1–7,16 
However, in patients with AF, additional ablation targets 
beyond isolation of PVI as a routine strategy have not 
reduced AF recurrence or burden in RCTs.8–18 Although 
achieving durable pulmonary vein ablation in patients 
with AF has been associated with less recurrent ar-
rhythmias, other endpoints, such as termination of F and 
noninducibility, have not been associated with improved 
outcomes.19–28 Significant complications of AF ablation 
include stroke and TIAs, pericardial effusion, and vascu-
lar complications.16 The most serious complication that 
occurs after the ablation procedure is development of an 
esophageal atrial fistula, although other complications, 
such as PV stenosis can occur.8–18

Synopsis
Recurrences of AF are common after a first ablation 
procedure, occurring in 30% to 40% of patients in con-
temporary clinical trials.1,2 In general US practice, 11% 
of patients undergoing de novo ablation have a repeat 
ablation by 1 year.3 Patients often experience improved 
symptoms and QOL even when they experience recur-
rence after catheter ablation.4 Nonetheless, recurrent 
atrial arrhythmia that leads to symptoms or L V dysfunc-
tion requires treatment.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In general, successful suppression of AF improves 
with additional or multiple ablation procedures.5–7 The absolute limit to the number of ablations a 
patient can undergo is unknown. For example, it 
is possible that a patient with previous PVI and 
repeat ablations with substrate modification may 
benefit from ablation of PV to LA reconnections, 
or ablation of additional triggers. However, repeat 
ablations carry increased risks of adverse effects. 
These risks are rare but include PV stenosis and 
stiff LA syndrome.8,9,17
   Many of the randomized clinical trials, which have 
demonstrated superiority of catheter ablation over 
antiarrhythmic drug therapy, included repeat abla-
tion procedures as part of their prospective study 
designs.1,10,11,18 Randomized data also suggest that 
repeat ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drug 
therapy for the treatment of recurrent AF after first 
ablation.19 Although no large direct head-to-head 
trials are available of repeat catheter ablation ver-
sus no repeat catheter ablation, the aggregate data 
from randomized trials suggest that repeat abla-
tion improves arrhythmia suppression and symp-
tom control. Limited numbers of randomized trials 
can guide the optimal approach to repeat catheter 
ablation (beyond reisolation of the PVs).12,13
   Although randomized data suggest that repeat 
ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy 
for the treatment of recurrent AF after first abla-
tion,19 recurrences of AF after catheter ablation 
can also be successfully treated with antiarrhyth-
mic drug therapy even when these same medica-
tions may have been ineffective before ablation.3,14 
Antiarrhythmic drugs have also been associated 
with decreased recurrent atrial arrhythmias in 
those who have undergone previous ablation.14 
Other studies have shown that use of previously 
ineffective antiarrhythmic therapy can be effec-
tive after ablation.15 Optimal rhythm control often 
requires a combined approach of catheter ablation 
and adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug therapy, espe-
cially in patients with long-standing persistent AF 
or patients with advanced atrial myopathies.
 2. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the 
efficacy and safety of short-term (3-6 months 
postablation) antiarrhythmic therapy to prevent 
recurrences of AF, symptoms, cardioversion, and 
hospitalization after ablation.16,20,21 Moreover, con-
tinued use of antiarrhythmic drugs beyond the 
blanking period (3 months) may reduce the risk of 
recurrent atrial arrhythmias out to 1 year.15 Meta-
analysis of randomized trials evaluating the use 
of short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy have 
determined that it significantly decreases the risk 
of early, but not late, recurrence.22,23 Observational

Synopsis
Catheter ablation has been demonstrated in randomized 
clinical trials to reduce arrhythmia burden improve QOL 
and, in select populations, it has been shown to improve 
cardiovascular outcomes. Complications after catheter 
ablation are infrequent, yet the risk of thromboembolic 
events is increased after ablation. The risk of stroke in 
the first 30 days after ablation is 0.8%.18 Thus, oral an-
ticoagulation before, during, and after catheter ablation 
procedures is paramount.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. All patients undergoing catheter ablation require 
intraprocedural intravenous anticoagulation with 
heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors in those with 
heparin allergies. Management of oral anticoagu-
lation during these procedures is also critically 
important. In those patients undergoing catheter 
ablation of AF who are taking warfarin for their oral 
anticoagulation, evidence from observational stud-
ies and randomized trial data suggest that optimal 
efficacy and safety is achieved with uninterrupted 
warfarin. Patients undergoing catheter ablation of 
AF who have subtherapeutic INRs or interrupted 
warfarin have more evidence of silent cerebral isch-
emic events on brain magnetic resonance imaging 
after the procedure.1 In the COMPARE (Role of 
Coumadin in Preventing Thromboembolism in Atrial 
Fibrillation [AF] Patients Undergoing Catheter 
Ablation) trial, interruption of warfarin was highly associated with periprocedural thromboembolic 
events (OR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1-55.6]; P<0.001).1 
Patients treated with uninterrupted warfarin had 
lower rates of thromboembolic events (5% versus 
0.25%; P<0.001) and lower rates of periproce-
dural bleeding compared with those in whom war-
farin was stopped or interrupted.
 2. Although uninterrupted warfarin is superior to 
interrupted warfarin among persons undergoing 
catheter ablation of AF, meta-analyses have dem-
onstrated lower risks of major bleeding with unin-
terrupted direct oral anticoagulation compared with 
uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism.2 Many ran-
domized trials have been completed that compare 
uninterrupted DOACs versus uninterrupted VKAs, 
including trials of apixaban,3,4 dabigatran,5 edoxa-
ban,6 and rivaroxaban.7 In aggregate, these trials 
have demonstrated the noninferiority of uninter-
rupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation compared 
with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism. Several 
randomized trials also compare minimally inter-
rupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation versus 
uninterrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation8 or 
uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism.9 These clinical 
trials and meta-analyses suggest that outcomes 
with minimally interrupted direct-acting oral antico-
agulation are not different compared with continu-
ous anticoagulation.10
 3. The risk of thromboembolic and stroke events 
increases after ablation due to vascular and car-
diac instrumentation, release of tissue factor, and 
myocardial injury. Most randomized clinical trials 
of catheter ablation that demonstrate a low risk of 
periprocedural stroke mandated oral anticoagula-
tion for a minimum of 2 months after ablation to 
reduce the risk of stroke, regardless of CHA2DS2-
VASc score.19
 4. Greater burden or time in AF is associated with 
higher rates of stroke.12–14 Accordingly, reduc-
ing exposure to AF via catheter ablation might be 
expected to reduce the risk of stroke. Although 
some observational studies have identified lower 
stroke risk after catheter ablation,15,16 randomized 
clinical trials of catheter ablation have not dem-
onstrated reductions in stroke.11,17 Observational 
data regarding the risk of stroke after catheter 
ablation of AF are mixed and vary across study 
design and methods. For example, in an analysis of 
4 050 patients undergoing catheter ablation with a 
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 in Denmark, the risk after 
ablation was low and comparable in those who did 
(0.93/100 patient years) and did not (0.97/100 
patient years) discontinue anticoagulation >3 
months after ablation.20 In contrast, a study of 6 866 
patients who underwent catheter ablation of AF in 
US clinical practice found that the risk of stroke was

In this same study, no increased risk was observed

whether oral anticoagulation can be safely discon-
tinued in patients who have no significant arrhyth-
mia recurrences after catheter ablation. Finally, 
the OPTION (Comparison of Anticoagulation With 
Left Atrial Appendage Closure After AF Ablation) 
trial (NCT03795298) will test whether LAAO is 
noninferior to continued oral anticoagulation after 
catheter ablation of AF.22 Given (1) the absence of 
randomized data that directly address this ques-
tion, (2) the absence of consistent data demon-
strating a lower risk of stroke after ablation, and 
(3) increased rates of stroke among persons with 
a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 who discontinue oral 
anticoagulation after 3 months, persons who have 
undergone catheter ablation AF should continue 
guideline-directed oral anticoagulation beyond 3 
months based on their stroke risk, such as those 
with moderate-high risk of stroke.
8.4.5. Complications After AF Catheter Ablation
Complications of AF catheter ablation occur in ap-
proximately 5% of patients, with most being vascular  
(Table 26).1–4 However, several life-threatening compli-
cations may occur. Complications are more common 
with annual operator procedures <25 patients and 
hospital procedures <50 patients.1 Some studies dem-
onstrate a higher incidence of complications in wom-en,1 but the CABANA RCT did not.5 The most severe 
complication is an LA to esophageal fistula, which is 
often fatal but quite rare. Another life-threatening com-
plication is pericardial tamponade, but this can usually 
be treated with prompt pericardiocentesis. Clinically 
significant strokes and TIAs are observed in <1% of 
patients.1–4 Deaths during ablations are typically from 
tamponade but may occur with strokes.1–4
Phrenic and vagal nerve paralysis are seen with cryo-
ablation but are less common in radiofrequency ablation.2 
Early reports of PV stenosis were largely due to ablation 
inside the veins; with antral ablation this is rarely seen. The 
most common complications include bruising and bleed-
ing at the vascular access site. Less common vascular 
complications include damage to the arterial or venous 
system or an atrioventricular fistula requiring surgery.

Synopsis
In patients with pacemakers, programming strategies 
to reduce RV pacing reduce the incidence of AF.1–6 Be-
cause AF is observed in patients with symptomatic sinus 
node dysfunction who require permanent pacemakers-
for rate support, pacing algorithms were designed 20 
to 30 years ago to suppress atrial ectopy but, unfortu-
nately, no algorithm was able to successfully reduce AF 
in RCTs.12,16–19 More recently, antitachycardia pacing al-
gorithms have been designed to identify and terminate 
atrial arrhythmias and have been moderately effective 
in patients with arrhythmias associated with more orga-
nized atrial activation due to reentry.7–13
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Several randomized and nonrandomized stud-
ies have shown that in patients who require car-
diac-implanted electronic devices for sinus node 
dysfunction who have intact atrioventricular con-
duction, devices that maintain atrioventricular syn-
chrony reduce the incidence and progression of 
AF.1–6 Although maintenance of atrioventricular 
synchrony is important, post hoc analysis of MOST 
and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 
amount of ventricular pacing is an important con-
tributor to the development of AF.6,20 Algorithms 
designed specifically to reduce ventricular pacing 
reduced the incidence of AF in individual stud-
ies, but meta-analyses of RCTs suggests that the 
benefit may extend only to those patients with very 
infrequent pacing (<10%).19,21–23 In the only ran-
domized study that solely evaluated patients with 
atrioventricular block (and >70 years of age) who 
required permanent pacing, dual-chamber pacing 
did not reduce the incidence of AF when compared 
with single-chamber ventricular pacing.24
 2. Several studies have reported that specialized 
antitachycardia pacing algorithms can terminate 
atrial tachyarrhythmias but have not reduced AF 
burden.7–9 However, in a post hoc analysis of a 
subset of patients who had high success rate of 
antitachycardia pacing (≥ 60%), antitachycardia pac-
ing algorithms reduced the overall AF/AT burden 
from 2.5 hours/day to 0.68 hours/day (P <0.01).10 
A more recent study (MINERVA [Minimize Right 
Ventricular Pacing to Prevent Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure]) found a modestly effective pacing 
algorithm that monitors for periods of regularization 
of atrial activity to initiate pacing algorithms reduced 
progression to persistent AF.11,12 This algorithm may 
be more effective in patients who have undergone 
previous AF ablation.13
 3. Early nonrandomized evidence suggests that His 
bundle and left bundle pacing may reduce AF inci-
dence and progression when compared with RV 
pacing in patients with high burden ventricular pac-
ing.14,15 In 1 study, left bundle branch area pacing 
reduced the incidence of new AF when compared 
with RV pacing, but this benefit was only evident 
in those patients with ventricular pacing >20%.14 
However, a meta-analysis that has evaluated all 
published evidence has only demonstrated a trend 
toward reduced AF. In 1 study, His bundle pacing 
reduced the likelihood of development of persis-
tent AF in patients with sinus node dysfunction and 
a PR interval >180 ms.25 There is indirect evidence 
for the potential benefit of the ventricular depolar-
ization pattern for reducing AF because an algo-
rithm that automatically adjusts pacing parameters 
based on intrinsic conduction has been associated 
with a decrease in longer AF episodes (>48 hours) 
when compared with conventional programming in 
a retrospective analysis.26–28
 4. Several studies have evaluated atrial pacing algo-
rithms to reduce AF.12,16–19 Pacing algorithms to 
minimize ventricular pacing in ATTEST (Atrial 
Therapy Efficacy and Safety Trial), a combination of 
algorithms designed to suppress AF and also pro-
vide antitachycardia pacing did not suppress atrial 
arrhythmias in patients with paroxysmal AF (AF fre-
quency 1.3 episodes/month when “on” compared 
with 1.2 episodes/month when “off”).8 Despite 
optimistic results in some studies,12 a meta-anal-
ysis found no benefit with atrial pacing algorithms 
for reducing the incidence of AF.19

Among patients with AF or AFL, concomitant surgi-
cal ablation at the time of cardiac surgery has been 
shown to reduce the risk of recurrent atrial arrhyth-
mia. However, it is associated with an increased 
risk of renal dysfunction and pacemaker placement. 
Among patients with symptomatic, persistent AF, a 
hybrid procedure combining epicardial and endocar-
dial ablation has been shown to reduce the burden of 
atrial arrhythmia.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. The original atrial maze procedure consisted of a 
biatrial lesion set derived from a “cut-and-sew” 
technical approach.8 Similar lesion sets delivered 
by cryoenergy or radiofrequency were subse-
quently developed. Surgical ablation concomi-
tant with cardiac surgery currently takes place in 
approximately 1 in 5 patients with previous AF, 
most commonly at the time of a mitral valve 
procedure but also during aortic and tricuspid 
procedures or CABG.9 In a Cochrane review of 
22 clinical trials conducted between 1998 and 
2013, there was evidence that surgical ablation is 
associated with increased freedom from AF, AFL, 
or AT (RR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.63-2.55]). However, 
risk of pacemaker placement was increased (RR, 
1.69 [95% CI, 1.12-2.54]).1,2 A subsequent trial of 
patients undergoing mitral valve surgery with AF 
similarly found that ablation leads to increased 
freedom from AF at 1 year (63.2% versus 29.4%; 
P<0.001) but with increased risk of pacemaker 
placement (21.5 versus 8.1 per 100 patient-
years; P=0.01).3 Observational data suggest 
surgical ablation is associated with increased 
survival as well as risk of pacemaker placement 
and renal dysfunction.10–14
 2. Two components of Virchow’s triad—endothelial 
injury and stasis of blood flow—can lead to a pro-
thrombogenic milieu in the context of surgical 
ablation. The former is a consequence of suture 
lines or ablation lesions, whether they result 
from radiofrequency or cryoenergy. The latter 
can occur with postcardioversion atrial stunning 
and/or atrial manipulation and consequent loss 
of mechanical function. Accordingly, trial proto-
cols for several key studies of surgical ablation 
include the use of oral anticoagulation for at least 
3 months after intervention.2,3 Nonrandomized 
data suggest that stroke or systemic embolism 
in the first 3 months after catheter ablation is 
uncommon, but the risk increases with discon-
tinuation of oral anticoagulation, especially in 
high-risk patients.4 Patients who undergo surgi-
cal ablation may be at similar risk, and thus oral anticoagulation, whether it be with warfarin or 
a DOAC15 because appropriate accounting for 
concomitant indications such as a mechanical 
heart valve or mitral stenosis, should be initiated 
regardless of stroke risk when adequate surgical 
hemostasis has been achieved.
 3. In a randomized trial of 149 patients with symptom-
atic and refractory AF, compared with catheter 
ablation, a hybrid procedure consisting of closed-
chest, epicardial ablation combined with and fol-
lowed by endocardial ablation led to increased 
freedom atrial arrhythmias, including AF, AFL, and 
AT at 12 months (67 .7% versus 50.0%; P =0.036) 
at the expense of an increased risk of major 
adverse events such as stroke, bleeding, or peri-
cardial effusion (0.0% versus 7 .8%; P=0.0525).16 
The ablation set of the hybrid procedure focused 
on surgical ablation of the LA posterior wall and 
PVI, while endocardial ablation completed PVI 
and addressed remaining gaps. Other observa-
tional studies of hybrid procedures with limited 
sizes show comparable rates of AF-free survival 
and safety.5–7
9. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH HF
9.1. General Considerations for AF and HF
AF and HF frequently coexist, and either can predispose 
to the development of the other. Shared risk factors  
(eg, age, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and hypertension) 
may contribute, as may atrial remodeling and diastolic 
dysfunction.1–3 The prevalence of AF is higher in pa-
tients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
compared with HFrEF.4 In a recent study of the Fram-
ingham cohort, among individuals with new AF, more 
than one-third (37%) had HF.5 Conversely, among in-
dividuals with new HF, more than half (57%) had AF. A 
meta-analysis, including 53 969 patients from 9 obser-
vational and 7 randomized trials, concluded that after 
adjusting for confounding factors, AF was associated 
with an increased total mortality, irrespective of L V sys-
tolic dysfunction, with an OR of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.32-
1.48) in randomized trials and an OR of 1.14 (95% CI, 
1.03-1.26) in observational studies.6 The risk of mortal-
ity is higher when AF is incident after a diagnosis of 
HF as compared with prevalent AF, and in patients with 
HFrEF compared with heart failure with preserved ejec-
tion fraction.4,7–9
Special considerations for the management of 
patients with HF and AF are discussed in the next sec-
tion on management of AF in HF, as well as in Section 
7 .2 (“Specific Pharmacological Agents for Rate Con-
trol”) and Section 8.2 (“Electrical and Pharmacologi-
cal Cardioversion”).

HFpEF with reasonable expectation of benefit,  
catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms 
and improve QOL.14,15

control, in combination with other rate-controlling agents 
or as monotherapy if other agents are not tolerated.16,17

in whom beta blockers or calcium channel blockers  
are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous  
amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control.†18,19
2a B-R 6. In patients with AF, HFrEF (L VEF <50%), and  
refractory rapid ventricular response who are not 
candidates for or in whom rhythm control has failed, 
AVNA and biventricular pacing therapy can be useful 
to improve symptoms, QOL, and EF.20–23

beneficial to improve functional class,24,25 reduce the risk 
of ICD shock,26 and improve survival.24,25
2a B-NR 8. In patients with AF-induced cardiomyopathy who have 
recovered L V function, long-term surveillance can be 
beneficial to detect recurrent AF in view of the high risk 
of recurrence of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy.27,28
2b B-NR 9. In patients with suspected AF-induced cardiomyopathy  
or refractory HF symptoms undergoing pharmacological 
rate-control therapy for AF, a stricter rate-control strategy 
(target heart rate <80 bpm at rest and <110 bpm during 
moderate exercise) may be reasonable.29–31
2b C-LD10. In patients with AF and HFrEF who undergo AVNA, 
conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left 
bundle branch area may be reasonable as an alterna-
tive to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms,  
QOL, and L V function.32–35

administered for maintenance of sinus rhythm to 
those with NYHA class III and IV HF or patients who 
have had an episode of decompensated HF in the 
past 4 weeks, due to the risk of increased early  
mortality associated with worsening HF.37

sinus rhythm (Section 8.3.1, “Specific Drug Therapy for Long-Term Maintenance 
of Sinus Rhythm”). †Consider the risk of cardioversion and stroke when using 
amiodarone as a rate-control agent.Synopsis
AF is the most common cause of arrhythmia-induced 
cardiomyopathy,27,38 a condition where persistent AF, 
with or without rapid ventricular rates, can lead to L V 
dysfunction and HF that can be partially or completely 
reversed with adequate arrhythmia control.39 AF can 
either be the only reason for cardiomyopathy (AF-in-
duced) or can exacerbate L V dysfunction and HF in a 
patient with concomitant structural heart disease (AF-
mediated).38,39 Medical therapies for rate control (Sec-
tion 7) or rhythm control (Section 8) of AF have special 
considerations in patients with HF based on differential 
safety. Routine pharmacological rhythm compared with 
rate control has not demonstrated benefit on clinical 
outcomes in patients with HFrEF,29,40 although a re-
cent subgroup analysis of patients with HF (most heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction) demonstrated 
benefit of early rhythm control compared to rate control 
on clinical outcomes.1 Several trials have compared AF 
catheter ablation with medical therapy in patients with 
HFrEF. Although earlier trials were small and focused 
on endpoints such as improvement in L VEF, QOL, and 
6-minute walk, 2 of the largest trials have shown a ben-
efit in reducing mortality rate and HF hospitalization.3–13 
Patients with AF and HF may undergo AVNA for rate 
control refractory to medical therapy.20,21 Similar to find-
ings in patients who undergo pacemaker implantation 
for conduction system disease, patients with HF appear 
to be more likely to develop or have worsened cardio-
myopathy related to RV pacing dyssynchrony41,42 and 
have improved outcomes with biventricular or conduc-
tion system pacing.23,32,33,35

 1. It can be difficult to determine the extent of the 
contribution of AF to cardiomyopathy and new 
onset HFrEF. Allowing AF to persist long term, 
regardless of reasonable rate control, may result 
in worsening HF and cardiomyopathy. An early 
and aggressive approach to rhythm control can 
reduce AF burden, resulting in favorable ventricu-
lar remodeling and halting of any occult arrhyth-
mia-induced cardiomyopathy. In a prespecified 
subanalysis of 798 HF patients (NYHA class II/
III or L VEF <50%) in EAST-AFNET (HFpEF, 
442; midrange, 211; HFrEF [<40%], 132), early 
rhythm control significantly improved the compos-
ite outcome of death, stroke, or hospitalization for 
worsening of HF or for ACS (early rhythm control, 
94/396; 5.7/100 patient-years) versus usual care 
(130/402; 7 .9/100 patient-years; HR, 0.74 [95% 
CI, 0.56-0.97]; P=0.03), and this was not altered 
by HF status. Safety outcomes in each group were 
comparable. However, only 17% of the HF popula-
tion had L VEF <40%.1 In a post hoc analysis of the 
CASTLE-AF trial, an AF burden <50% at 6 months

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationpostcatheter ablation was associated with signifi-
cant improvement in the mortality rate and HF hos-
pitalization in patients with AF and HFrEF.2
 2. Multiple RCTs in HFrEF have shown that in patients 
with symptoms due to AF, ablation improves symp-
toms and QOL compared with a rate control or an 
antiarrhythmic drug strategy.3–13 In each of 3 meta-
analyses, QOL was improved.3,10,13 Although in the 
past a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs was advised 
before pursuing catheter ablation, current data 
support ablation for AF as first-line therapy even 
before antiarrhythmic drugs; often patients require 
both. Data on L VEF, hospitalizations, and mortality 
rates are less robust, but nearly every larger RCT 
does show some benefit in these outcomes (Table 
27). Characteristics that may identify patients with 
a higher likelihood of success or failure with AF 
catheter ablation are listed in Figure 24.43
 3. Data for AF catheter ablation are far less robust 
for HFpEF. The largest analysis for this group of 
patients was a subanalysis of the CABANA trial 
of patients with HF; in this subgroup analysis, 778 
patients (35% of the study population) enrolled in 
the study who had NYHA class II HF experienced 
improvement in survival, freedom from AF recur-
rence, and improved QOL compared with the medi-
cal therapy group.14 Most of these had HFpEF. In 
this subanalysis, catheter ablation was associated 
with a reduction in the mortality rate and HF. A 
meta-analysis on catheter ablation in patients with 
HFpEF that included 7 studies and 764 patients 
showed the ablation to be safe and effective and 
associated with lower hospitalizations and the mor-
tality rate.15
 4. A small RCT in patients with persistent AF and HF 
(most HFrEF) compared the effects of digoxin, 
carvedilol, and the combination.16 Combination 
therapy was associated with better rate con-
trol and symptom relief than monotherapy. The 
RATE-AF trial randomized 160 patients (≥60 years 
of age) with persistent AF and HF (81% with L VEF 
≥50%) to digoxin or bisoprolol.17 No significant 
difference was noted in the primary endpoint of 
QOL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes, including 
natriuretic peptide levels, were significantly lower 
in the digoxin group, without a significant differ-
ence in resting heart rate at 12 months. Adverse 
effects were less common in the digoxin group. 
Observational and post hoc analyses have sug-
gested an excess mortality with digoxin in patients 
with AF; however, residual confounding due to the 
use of digoxin in sicker patients may have a role.44 
In patients with HF on digoxin chronically, post hoc 
analyses have suggested increased mortality rates 
and hospitalization with serum digoxin levels ≥1 
ng/mL; levels <0.8 ng/mL in HF were associated with the lowest mortality rate, although the study 
was for therapy of HF and not AF.45 In the DAAF 
(Digitalis in Acute Atrial Fibrillation) trial of 239 
patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin led to 
a significant decrease in heart rate at 2 hours com-
pared with placebo.
 5. In trials of critically ill patients, some of which 
included a smaller proportion of patients with HF, 
intravenous amiodarone has been shown to be 
effective in controlling ventricular rates.18,19,46 In a 
randomized trial of 60 such patients (13 with HF), 
significant rate control was achieved with both 
intravenous diltiazem and intravenous amiodarone. 
However, intravenous diltiazem was associated 
with a significantly higher frequency of hypoten-
sion requiring discontinuation.19 In another ret-
rospective study of 38 patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit (9 with HF), intravenous amiod-
arone was associated with a statistically significant 
decrease in ventricular rate without decrease in 
BP (and in some cases improved hemodynamics) 
compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin.18 
Intravenous beta blockers may also cause hypo-
tension and may not be tolerated in patients with 
HF and hemodynamic instability. Although less 
frequent, intravenous amiodarone can also be 
associated with hypotension, specifically with the 
intravenous bolus. The possibility of conversion 
to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone and 
associated potential for thromboembolism, espe-
cially in patients with longer-standing AF not on 
anticoagulation, should factor into the risk-benefit 
decision when intravenous amiodarone is chosen 
for rate control.
 6. Small RCTs of patients with medically refractory 
AF and HF show that patients who undergo AVNA 
and conventional pacemaker implantation are less 
symptomatic and have improvements in QOL and 
exercise tolerance compared with subjects who are 
managed with medical rate control.20–22,47 A meta-
analysis comparing outcomes with AVNA or medi-
cations showed, in 2 studies analyzing patients 
with reduced EF, a modest, yet significant +4% 
increase in EF in patients undergoing AVNA and

line did not show a significant change.48 A meta-
analysis of 93 studies including 11 343 patients 
who underwent AVNA with either RV pacing or 
biventricular pacing showed periprocedural compli-
cations of arrhythmia, HF, and lead dislodgement 
in 2% to 2.5%,49 few long-term data, and worse 
outcomes in younger patients with reduced EF and 
RV pacing.49 Overall, these data showed improved 
mortality in patients with HF who are treated with 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), at the risk 
of increased device-related complications.49 The

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationAPAF-CRT (Ablate and Pace in Atrial Fibrillation 
plus Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) mortal-
ity trial of 133 subjects with AF, HF, and narrow 
QRS was stopped early due to a HR of 0.26 for all-
cause mortality, also suggesting that when AVNA 
is performed in patients with HF, CRT is preferable 
to conventional RV pacing.23 Data are accumulat-
ing regarding similarly improved outcomes with 
conduction system pacing compared with conven-
tional RV pacing in this population.32–35
 7 . Conduction of AF may hinder delivery of biventricu-
lar pacing therapy (CRT) and worsen outcomes.25 
Initial clinical trials of CRT included low numbers of 
patients with AF,50 and observational analyses sug-
gested a reduced benefit of CRT in patients with 
AF due to ineffective biventricular pacing.51,52 A 
systematic review to evaluate the impact of AVNA 
in patients with AF and CRT found AVNA was 
associated with significant reductions in all-cause 
mortality (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.26-0.68]), cardio-
vascular mortality (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.81]), 
and improvement in NYHA class (RR, –0.52 [95% 
CI, –0.87 to –0.17]).24 Confirmatory evidence of the 
importance of adequate biventricular pacing per-
centage is provided by an analysis of remote moni-
toring data showing a strong association between 
increasing percentages of biventricular pacing 
and reduced mortality, with the greatest magni-
tude reduction at >98% pacing.53 In a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of 31 studies in 83 571 
individuals, CRT alone did not improve the mortality 
rate in patients with AF, but the all-cause mortality 
rate was lower in the AVNA group.25 Many patients 
with CRT devices also have combined defibrillator 
therapy. In a pooled analysis of 664 patients with 
AF and CRT in whom 282 underwent AVNA, a sig-
nificant reduction in appropriate and inappropriate 
ICD shocks and a decrease in all-cause hospital-
izations was associated with AVNA.26
 8. In an observational study of 24 patients with 
AF-induced cardiomyopathy and NYHA class III/
IV HF, the median time from onset of arrhythmia to 
cardiomyopathy and HF was 4.2 years. Aggressive 
rate/rhythm control resulted in significant L VEF 
recovery in all patients within 6 months. Five of 
24 patients had recurrent AF, and all had a rapid 
decline in L VEF within 6 months after arrhythmia 
recurrence.27 In an observational cohort of 69 
patients with AF and L VEF <40% who underwent 
catheter ablation, patients who maintained sinus 
rhythm (65%) had complete L V function recovery 
and maintained normal L VEF over 28±11 months 
of follow-up, compared with those who had recur-
rent AF/AT.28 Long-term surveillance to detect 
recurrent AF can be beneficial and can be accom-
plished by various modalities, including wearable devices, smart watches, random monitoring (Holter, 
event, mobile telemetry), and implantable loop 
recorders.
 9. In patients with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopa-
thy and HFrEF, the ideal target heart rate for rate 
control remains uncertain. However, because of 
the potential negative impact of rapid ventricu-
lar rates on HF and cardiomyopathy, a stricter 
rate-control strategy may be reasonable. In the 
AF-CHF trial, which compared rate control ver-
sus rhythm control using antiarrhythmic therapy 
in AF and HFrEF, the target rate control was 
defined as ventricular rate <80 bpm during rest-
ing 12-lead electrocardiography and <110 bpm 
during a 6-minute walk test.29 In the RACE II trial, 
614 patients with permanent AF were random-
ized to a heart rate <80 bpm at rest and <110 
bpm during moderate exercise or lenient control 
(resting heart rate, <110 bpm), with results show-
ing similar outcomes in each arm. However, RACE 
II trial patients were rate controlled at enrollment 
(baseline heart rate, 96 bpm), and only 15% of 
the study cohort had an L VEF <40%, plus very 
few patients had heart rates >100 bpm, even in 
the lenient rate control gorup.54 In a crossover 
study of 20 patients with persistent AF and L VEF 
<40%, patients were given escalating doses of 
metoprolol (average dose, 121 mg) to get tar-
get heart rate <70 bpm. After 3 months, average 
resting heart rate decreased from 94±14 bpm 
to 85±12 bpm, but no significant differences in 
QOL on functional status were noted.31 Strict rate 
control is also advisable in patients with ICDs 
and CRT (See Table 20 in Section 7 .1, “Broad 
Considerations for Rate Control”).55,56
 10. In small observational series of patients undergo-
ing AVNA and His bundle pacing, postprocedural 
increase in EF and improved functional class has 
been demonstrated, at the expense of increased 
pacing thresholds in some patients.32,35 A single-
center study comparing outcomes after AVNA with 
His bundle pacing and left bundle area pacing in 
105 patients showed a higher rate of recurrent 
AVN conduction in the His bundle pacing group 
and longer fluoroscopy time.33 Acute threshold 
rise, exit block, and elevated long-term thresholds 
were also seen in the His bundle pacing group but 
not in left bundle area pacingin follow-up limited 
to 10.5 months. Both strategies were associated 
with a significantly improved EF in patients with 
EF <50% at baseline (N=16; 37%±7 .6% versus 
46%±13%; P=0.02).33 An observational compara-
tive study of patients undergoing AVNA, of whom 
113 had RV (56) or BiV (57) pacing and 110 had

and 46 left bundle area pacing) showed increased

(P=0.04) in RV/BiVP.34 A combined endpoint of 
time to death or HF hospitalization was reduced in 
the conduction system pacing group in >2 years 
of follow-up, but extrapolation is limited due to the 
observational and selected nature of the popula-
tion and because the RV/BiVP group had lower EF 
and wider QRS at baseline.34
 11. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel block-
ers—diltiazem and verapamil—are negative inotro-
pic agents and may not be tolerated in patients 
with HFrEF. In the acute setting, limited data from 
2 retrospective analyses suggest the potential for 
increased morbidity with the use of diltiazem in 
patients with HFrEF, including worsening HF, need 
for inotropic support, or acute kidney injury.57,58 In 
the chronic setting, diltiazem had no impact on 
mortality in a trial of patients with nonischemic 
cardiomyopathy.59 However, in the multicenter ran-
domized MDPIT of patients postacute MI, HF and 
cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarc-
tion) were more frequent in the patients with L VEF 
<40% or pulmonary congestion who were ran-
domized to diltiazem. Among those with a baseline 
EF of <40%, late HF appeared in 12% receiving 
placebo and 21% receiving diltiazem (P=0.004). 
Life table analysis in patients with an EF of <40% 
confirmed more frequent late HF in those taking 
diltiazem (P=0.0017). In addition, the diltiazem-
associated increase in the frequency of late HF 
was progressively greater with decreasing base-
line EF.36 This increase in late HF was not seen 
in patients with pulmonary congestion at baseline 
but an EF of ≥40%, suggesting the association of 
diltiazem-related late HF was present only in those 
with systolic L V dysfunction.
 12. The ANDROMEDA37 study was a randomized, 
double-blind placebo-controlled study that tested 
the hypothesis that dronedarone would reduce 
the rate of hospitalization due to HF and pos-
sibly reduce mortality by reducing the incidence 
of arrhythmic death. The study enrolled patients 
who were hospitalized with new or worsening HF 
and who had at least 1 episode of NYHA class III 
or IV HF (shortness of breath on minimal exertion 
or at rest). More than 40% of the patients had 
NYHA class II HF at baseline. The investigators 
reported that, contrary to the study’s hypothesis, 
mortality was higher in the dronedarone group 
compared to that in the placebo group (8.1% 
versus 3.8%; HR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.07-4.25]; 
P=0.03). The excess mortality was principally 
associated with worsening HF.10. AF AND SPECIFIC PATIENT GROUPS

2b B-NR 1. In patients with an onset of unexplained AF before  
30 years of age, electrophysiological study to  
evaluate and treat reentrant supraventricular  
tachyarrhythmias with a targeted ablation may be  
reasonable because of the high prevalence of reen-
trant arrhythmias in this group.1–3
2b B-NR 2. In patents with an onset of AF before 45 years of  
age without obvious risk factors for AF, referral for 
genetic counseling, genetic testing for rare patho-
genic variants, and surveillance for cardiomyopathy  
or arrhythmia syndromes may be reasonable.4,5
Synopsis
Young patients are less likely to develop AF or associ-
ated strokes compared with older populations. Consum-
er-driven use of wearable devices is increasing and can 
lead to the diagnosis of AF at a young age.6 In those 
<30 years of age, reentrant SVTs (atrioventricular nod-
al reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant 
tachycardia) are found in about 25% of patients.1–3 Tar-
geted ablation of the reentrant tachycardia is followed 
by resolution of AF episodes in most of these young 
patients. However, additional factors need to be taken 
into consideration in young patients who present with 
AF. Growing evidence suggests that, in addition to risk 
factors for AF present in older populations, young pa-
tients who develop AF may also harbor susceptibility for 
inherited ion channel and cardiomyopathic disorders,4 
even in those with normal echocardiograms.5 In addition 
to the standard workup for newly diagnosed AF, genetic 
testing for rare pathogenic variation, advanced imaging 
modalities, and surveillance screening could detect oth-
erwise occult cardiomyopathy.

10.2. Athletes
Recommendation for Athletes
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
2a B-NR 1. In athletes who develop AF, catheter ablation with  
PVI is a reasonable strategy for rhythm control 
because of its effectiveness and low risk of  
detrimental effect on exercise capacity.1,2
Synopsis
Engaging in moderate levels of exercise has several 
cardiovascular benefits and, in some studies, has been 
associated with a lower incidence of AF.3,4 However, 
high-volume endurance athleticism, defined here as 
exercise of >45 metabolic equivalent-hours per week, 
has been associated with a higher prevalence of AF,5 
particularly in young athletes.6 The mechanisms behind 
this association are not well established but may be re-
lated to atrial myopathy from exercise-induced stretch 
or perhaps inflamation.7,8 No studies have prospectively 
studied the effects of detraining on AF burden, but some 
have proposed that moderation of exercise may be con-
sidered, although it is unclear whether changes are 
reversible.9 Nevertheless, athletes will often choose to 
continue sport participation, and aggressive rhythm con-
trol strategies are often sought. Because many of these 
patients are young, medications are often not tolerated 
or preferred. PVI has been shown to be safe and effec-
tive in this population without resulting in a significant 
reduction in exercise capacity1 and has been shown to 
significantly improve QOL.2
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In a prospective cohort study of 144 athletes, AF 
ablation with PVI, including multiple procedures, 
resulted in freedom from AF at 1 year in 86% 
of athletes with paroxysmal AF and 68% of ath-
letes with persistent AF over a median follow-up 
of 3 years.1 Athletes underwent cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing before and after ablation 
and, although the sinus rate increased on average 
10 bpm after ablation (which may bother some ath-
letes and thus should be discussed before the pro-
cedure), no significant changes were observed in 
maximum metabolic equivalents on exercise tread-
mill testing. In a retrospective cohort study of 133 
competitive athletes who underwent catheter abla-
tion for AF with 10-year follow-up, 83% of athletes 
did not have recurrent events and had significantly 
improved QOL scores.2
10.3. Management Considerations in Patients 
With AF and Obesity
Obesity is a strong risk factor for AF.1 In the Framing-
ham Study, overweight and obesity increased the risk of 
incident AF, with a 4% increase in AF risk per unit in-
crease in BMI in men and women. Adjusted HRs for AF 
associated with obesity were 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09-2.13; 
P=0.02) and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.03-2.07; P=0.03) for men 
and women, respectively, compared with individuals with 
normal BMI. In that study, the excess risk of AF associ-
ated with obesity appeared to be mediated through LA 
dilatation.2 Other studies suggest that the risk of AF with 
obesity is mediated through epicardial and abdominal 
fat, or structural changes in the atria.1,3 Obesity is also 
associated with other comorbidities, including hyperten-
sion, HF, and sleep apnea, which themselves predispose 
to an increased incidence of AF. Further, higher BMI and 
obesity are associated with an increase in the burden of 
AF, including progression from paroxysmal to permanent 
AF, and an increased risk of AF recurrence after AF abla-
tion.4 Special considerations for the management of AF 
in patients with obesity include the role of weight loss in 
the primary and secondary prevention of AF (Section 5, 
“Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modification for AF Man-
agement”), as well as anticoagulation in patients with 
severe or class III obesity in this section and in Section 
10.4 (“Anticoagulation Considerations in Patients 
With Class III Obesity”).

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationSynopsis
Patients with class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) are 
underrepresented in the major clinical trials evaluat-
ing the efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients with 
AF. Post hoc analyses of major DOAC trials in AF and 
large observational studies have shown comparable 
efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin 
across weight groups, including patients with class III 
obesity.1–5 Thus, DOACs are preferred over warfarin for 
stroke risk prevention in patients with class III obesity 
and AF. Little evidence is available that evaluates the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of DOACs in pa-
tients with AF who have undergone bariatric surgery. 
Thus, warfarin may be reasonable to choose over DO -
ACs to reduce stroke risk in this population until further 
data become available.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Post hoc analyses of the ARISTOTLE (apixaban 
versus warfarin), ROCKET AF (rivaroxaban versus 
warfarin), and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban 
versus warfarin) demonstrated consistent efficacy 
(stroke and systemic embolism) and safety (major 
bleeding) of DOACs compared with warfarin across 
weight groups in patients with AF.3–5 A meta-anal-
ysis including these trials and RE-L Y (dabigatran 
versus warfarin) again showed similar efficacy and 
safety of DOACs compared with warfarin, although 
the outcome differences were attenuated in obese 
patients.2 A large retrospective observational study 
including 36 094 patients compared risk of isch-
emic stroke, significant bleeding, and mortality in 
patients receiving a DOAC or warfarin, stratified by 
BMI group.1 For all 3 endpoints, better outcomes 
were observed with DOACs across BMI groups. 
In patients with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2, a relative risk 
reduction of 25% for ischemic stroke (adjusted 
HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64-0.87]; P<0.001), 57% 
for significant bleeding (adjusted HR, 0.43 [95% 
CI, 0.20-0.94]; P<0.001), and 34% for all-cause 
mortality (adjusted HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.77]; 
P<0.001) was observed with DOACs compared 
with warfarin.
 2. Although case reports exist that demonstrate 
expected factor Xa trough levels in patients tak-
ing a DOAC who undergo bariatric surgery, a meta-
analysis of cohort studies, case series, and case 
reports has shown that 42% of patients who have 
undergone bariatric surgery had peak drug levels 
below the expected range.6,7 Patients who have 
undergone bariatric surgery are not well repre-
sented in any of the major trials comparing DOACs 
with warfarin, and few observational data support 
DOAC use in this population. Warfarin’s therapeutic 
effect can be routinely monitored. Thus, in patients with AF who have undergone bariatric surgery, 
warfarin may be a reasonable choice over DOACs 
for stroke risk reduction at this time.
10.5. AF and VHD
VHD and AF commonly coexist. AF independently pre-
dicts the risk of cerebrovascular events among patients 
with valve disease.1 This risk may be addressed with the 
use of oral anticoagulation, percutaneous and surgical 
LAAO, and surgical ablation as described in Sections 
6.5.1 (“Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the 
LAA”), 6.5.2 (“Cardiac Surgery—LAA Exclusion/Exci-
sion”), and 6.8.5 (“AF in VHD”).

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction 
(preexcited AF), and hemodynamic instability should 
be treated with electrical cardioversion.1,2
1 B-NR 2. For patients with AF with rapid anterograde  
conduction (preexcited AF), catheter ablation of 
accessory pathways (APs) is recommended.3–7
1 C-LD 3. In patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction 
(preexcited AF) and hemodynamic stability,  
pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous  
ibutilide or intravenous procainamide is recommended 
as an alternative to elective cardioversion.1,8,9
3: 
HarmB-NR 4. For patients with AF with anterograde accessory 
pathway conduction (preexcited AF), pharmacologi-
cal agents that block atrioventricular nodal con-
duction (verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, 
adenosine, or beta blockers) are contraindicated  
due to risk of precipitating VF or hemodynamic 
deterioration.10–14
Synopsis
WPW and preexcitation syndromes refer to the pres-
ence of extra-atrioventricular nodal connection(s) be-
tween atrium and ventricle; such APs are comprised of 
atrial tissue.15 AF occurs in approximately 15% of per-
sons with WPW and although the mechanism(s) remain 
unclear, the faster conduction properties of atrial tissue 
compared with the atrioventricular node allow for rapid 
rates in preexcited AF.15–17 The risk of preexcited AF is 
higher for those with multiple pathways and short ante-
grade pathway refractory period (<250 ms), which allows 
rapid conduction and predisposes to VF and sudden 
death.1,18,19 Moreover, AF in young persons without evi-
dence of comorbid conditions may be associated with an 
AP, and pathway ablation is definitive therapy for AF and 
SVT in these persons.1 For those who cannot undergo 
ablation, preventive pharmacological therapy is directed 
to slowing pathway conduction.20,21

 1. Preexcited AF can conduct rapidly over the path-
way and lead to VF. During an acute episode of 
preexcited AF with rapid ventricular response and 
hemodynamic instability, electrical cardioversion 
must be used to restore sinus rhythm.1,2
 2. Pathway ablation has well-established efficacy and 
safety for those with preexcited AF for prevention 
of VF.1 Multiple large-patient series point to a high 
success rate (93%-95%) balanced with low risk 
of major short- and long-term complications.3–7 
Electrophysiological study and AP ablation can be 
offered as first-line therapy.
 3. Pharmacological treatments that increase the 
refractory period of atrial tissue (ie, ibutilide or pro-
cainamide) can slow AP conduction and terminate 
AF. Hemodynamically stable patients presenting 
with preexcited AF with or without rapid ventricular 
rates can be pharmacologically managed with such 
agents.8,9 In 1 study involving 22 patients, ibutilide 
terminated AF in 21 patients and prolonged refrac-
toriness of the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje 
system, and AP.9
 4. AP conduction can accelerate with atrioventricu-
lar nodal block. Administration of pharmacological 
agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduc-
tion can increase the risk of VF. The use of atrio-
ventricular nodal blocking agents for patients 
with preexcited AF are potentially harmful due 
to the risk of accelerated pathway conduction 
and associated VF.1,10–12 One small series that 
reviewed intravenous amiodarone for this indica-
tion raised significant concerns in view of several 
published reports on instances of VF precipitated 
by amiodarone.13 In 1 study of patients with WPW 
who received verapamil during electrophysi-
ological study, verapamil decreased the shortest 
RR interval between preexcited ventricular com-
plexes during AF, and 2 patients deteriorated and 
required cardioversion.14 Data are very limited and 
observational, but because other safer options are 
readily available, atrioventricular nodal agents are 
best avoided in this setting.
10.7 . Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
The “AHA/ACC Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treat-
ment of Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” 
was published in December 2020, and this guideline 
included recommendations on AF.1 Data on AF in pa-
tients with HCM published since the 2020 hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy guideline were reviewed but did not 
result in any substantive changes in the recommenda-
tions from 2020.2–6 AF is highly prevalent in HCM and 
increases the risk of stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score should not apply to patients with HCM, because they 
have roughly an equivalent risk to a CHADs-VASc of 
3. Data on the use of DOACs in patients with HCM 
suggest these to be acceptable alternatives to warfa-
rin. When a rhythm-control strategy is needed, several 
antiarrhythmic drugs have been shown to be safe and 
effective, allowing for individualization according to  
underlying substrate and patient preference. Catheter 
ablation is also an important option, although more 
confirmatory studies have shown AF ablation is of low-
er success compared with patients without HCM.7 For 
specifics, please see the “2020 AHA/ACC Guideline 
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With Hy-
pertrophic Cardiomyopathy.”1
10.8. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD)
Recommendations for ACHD
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. In adults with congenital heart disease and AF, it is 
recommended to evaluate for and treat precipitating 
factors and reversible causes of AF, recognizing that 
residual hemodynamic sequelae may contribute to  
the occurrence of the arrhythmia.1,2
1 C-LD 2. In adults with AF and moderate or complex congeni-
tal heart disease, electrophysiological procedures 
should be performed by operators with expertise 
in ACHD procedures and in collaboration with an 
ACHD cardiologist, ideally in specialized centers, 
when available.3–5
1 C-LD 3. In adults with congenital heart disease and symp-
tomatic or hemodynamically significant paroxysmal or 
persistent AF, an initial strategy of rhythm control is 
recommended regardless of lesion severity as AF in 
this population is often poorly tolerated.6
2a B-NR 4. In symptomatic patients with simple congenital heart 
disease with antiarrhythmic drug–refractory AF, it is 
reasonable to choose ablation over long-term antiar-
rhythmic therapies.4,7
2b C-LD 5. In adults with congenital heart disease with AF 
undergoing PVI, it may be reasonable to include an 
ablative strategy in the right atrium directed at  
reentrant arrhythmia secondary to atriotomy scars 
and the CTI.8,9
2b C-LD 6. In adults with AF and moderate or severe forms  
of congenital heart disease, particularly those with  
low-flow states such as Fontan circulation, blind-
ending cardiac chambers, and cyanosis, it may be 
reasonable to treat with anticoagulation independent 
of conventional risk score to reduce risk of  
thromboembolic events.10
Synopsis
Atrial arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in 
adults with congenital heart disease, and AF surpasses 
intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia in patients with CHD 
>50 years of age.11 Risk factors for development of 
AF in patients with ACHD are similar to those for the 
general population; however, the presence of an atrial

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationseptal defect is an independent risk factor. Adults may 
be classified as having simple, moderate, or complex 
forms of CHD, based on a classification proposed in 
the “2018 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management 
of Adults With Congenital Heart Disease.”12 Choosing 
pharmacological therapy for treatment of patients with 
ACHD who have AF should consider factors such as 
coexisting sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular 
block, as well as the ventricular function and other co-
morbidities. Ablation strategies established in normal 
hearts can be applied to patients with simple forms 
of CHD; however, caution must be taken in those pa-
tients with moderate or complex forms of ACHD.13 
Knowledge of the underlying congenital anatomy is 
key, because access to the atrial chambers may re-
quire specialized approaches. In those patients with 
moderate or complex forms of CHD, electrophysiolog-
ical procedures should be performed by operators with 
expertise in CHD and in collaboration with an ACHD 
cardiologist.3
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Adults with CHD often have hemodynamic sequelae 
of childhood repair, and any new onset arrhythmia, 
including AF, should prompt an evaluation for treat-
able and reversible causes. Studies have shown 
that AF is correlated with RA dilation, thus neces-
sitating addressing the underlying substrate in addi-
tion to treating the arrhythmia.1,2
 2. Patients with ACHD who are undergoing inva-
sive electrophysiological procedures in specialized 
ACHD centers generally have better outcomes, 
including survival, than those managed in other 
care settings.3–5 Special attention is required to 
ensure appropriate periprocedural care, including 
identification of procedure-related risk factors and 
availability of ancillary imaging.12
 3. Adults with simple forms of CHD and AF are gen-
erally managed according to standard published 
guidelines. In those patients with moderate or 
complex forms of CHD, choice of antiarrhythmic 
therapy should be individualized.6 Most antiar-
rhythmic drugs are associated with proarrhyth-
mic effects and increased mortality in ACHD 
patients.14 Rhythm control is generally preferred 
over rate control in patients with ACHD with 
moderate or complex disease who may toler-
ate AF poorly. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs must 
be avoided in patients with ACHD with CAD or 
significant subpulmonary or systemic ventricular 
dysfunction.14–16 Amiodarone is an effective anti-
arrhythmic agent for maintaining sinus rhythm in 
patients with ACHD; however, long-term therapy 
is limited by adverse effects, particularly amiod-
arone-induced thyrotoxicosis, which is common in women with CHD, cyanotic CHD, and those 
with Fontan physiology.17 Amiodarone should also 
be avoided in patients with ACHD who have a 
BMI <21 kg/m2 due to the increased incidence 
of thyrotoxicosis in these patients.18 Dofetilide 
may be a viable alternative to amiodarone in this 
complex population.19 Extrapolating data from 
noncongenital populations, dronedarone is best 
avoided in patients with ACHD who have mod-
erate or complex disease or significant ventricu-
lar dysfunction due to the increased risk of HF, 
stroke, and death.20,21
 4. Data on ablative strategies for AF in patients with 
ACHD are limited; however, when performed 
by experienced centers, AF ablation in patients 
with simple forms of CHD is safe.4,13 Knowledge 
of the underlying congenital anatomy is key, as 
access to the atrial chambers may require differ-
ent approaches, including transseptal puncture. 
Patients with ACHD who have persistent AF have 
lower success rates for ablation, and multiple pro-
cedures may be required.22 There are insufficient 
data on the role, safety, and benefit of AF ablation 
in complex forms of CHD.
 5. PVI has a lower success rate in patients with 
ACHD than in patients with structurally normal 
hearts. The operator should understand the vari-
ations in systemic and pulmonary venous anat-
omy, such as a left superior vena cava, which 
may be a trigger for AF.9 Due to related pathol-
ogy in the right atrium of patients with repaired 
complex ACHD, additional ablative therapies 
directed at atriotomy scars and the CTI may be 
necessary. Cryoballoon ablation is a safe option 
for patients with simple or moderate forms of 
CHD and AF.23,24
 6. All patients with CHD should be considered 
for some form of thromboembolic prophylaxis. 
Select groups of patients with CHD are at higher 
risks for thromboembolic events, such as cya-
notic lesions, those with low-flow states (Fontan 
physiology), and those with blind-ending cardiac 
chambers. The prevalence of cerebrovascular 
accidents in patients with ACHD is estimated 
to be 10- to 100-fold higher than age-matched 
controls, and thromboembolic events account for 
at least 4% of all-cause mortality in patients with 
CHD.25 Increased complexity of CHD is associ-
ated with thromboembolic events, but CHA2DS2 
and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are not predictive of 
thromboembolic risk in patients with ACHD; there-
fore, therapies must be individualized.10 Limited 
data are available for the use of DOACs in patients 
with ACHD, but in a survey, they appeared to be 
safe and effective.26

COR LOE Recommendations 
2a B-R 1. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are at 
high risk for postoperative AF, it is reasonable to 
administer short-term prophylactic beta blockers or 
amiodarone to reduce the incidence of  
postoperative AF.1–5
2a B-R 2. In patients undergoing CABG, aortic valve, or ascend-
ing aortic aneurysm operations, it is reasonable to 
perform concomitant posterior left pericardiotomy to 
reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.6,7
Synopsis
New-onset AF after cardiac surgery is common and has 
been associated with increased risks of late mortality 
and stroke.8 Trials of prophylactic amiodarone and beta 
blockers have demonstrated effectiveness reducing the 
occurrence of new AF, but not in all studies. Building 
off previous studies, the PALACS (Effect of Posterior 
Pericardiotomy on the Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation Af-
ter Cardiac Surgery) randomized trial studied the use 
of posterior left pericardiotomy7 and found significant 
reduction of AF in the treated group (17% versus 32% 
no intervention group; P =0.0007; OR, 0.44). Colchicine 
has shown uncertain benefit based on the results of 
more recent studies compared with earlier encourag-
ing trials. Drug adverse effects result in frequent drug 
discontinuation.9–11
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Preoperative prophylaxis with beta blockers or 
amiodarone has shown mixed benefit, and stud-
ies are difficult to compare because of variable 
medication combinations.1–5 One double-blind 
RCT of 601 patients listed for nonemergency 
CABG surgery and/or valve replacement/repair 
surgery showed a significant reduction of AF with 
amiodarone. 2. A meta-analysis and RCT showed that the inci-
dence of postoperative AF was significantly lower 
in patients treated with posterior left pericardiot-
omy during their cardiac procedure; however, the 
studies did not include patients undergoing mitral 
or tricuspid procedures.6,7

COR LOE Recommendations 
1A* 1. In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, beta  
blockers* are recommended to achieve rate control  
for AF1–4 unless contraindicated or ineffective in  
which case a nondihydropyridine calcium channel 
blocker† is recommended.5B-R†
1 B-R 2. In hemodynamically stable cardiac surgery patients 
with postoperative AF, rate-control (target heart rate, 
<100 bpm) and/or rhythm-control medications are 
recommended as initial therapy, with the choice of 
strategy according to patient symptoms, hemody-
namic consequences of the arrhythmia, and  
physician preference.5,6
1 B-R 3. In patients who develop poorly tolerated AF after  
cardiac surgery, direct current cardioversion in com-
bination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recom-
mended, with consideration of imaging to rule out  
left appendage thrombus before cardioversion in 
those patients in whom AF has been present >48 
hours and who have not been on anticoagulation.5,6
2a B-NR 4. In patients who develop postoperative AF after 
cardiac surgery, it is reasonable to administer anti-
coagulation when deemed safe in regard to surgical 
bleeding for 60 days after surgery unless complica-
tions develop and to reevaluate the need for longer 
term anticoagulation at that time.5,7
2a C-LD 5. In patients who develop AF after cardiac surgery  
and who are treated with rate-control strategy, at  
30- to 60-day follow-up it is reasonable to perform 
rhythm assessment and, if AF does not revert to  
sinus rhythm spontaneously, consider cardioversion 
after an adequate duration of anticoagulation.5,6

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationblockers.1–4 A randomized trial showed no significant 
clinical differences comparing a strategy of rate-control 
versus rhythm-control medications for patients who are 
hemodynamically stable.5 For those with poorly controlled  
AF, cardioversion is reasonable, but for those with >48 
hours of AF, imaging of the LAA (even if surgically 
closed) should be considered.5,6 The use of cardioversion 
and imaging in postoperative patients is a judgment call 
considering the patient’s clinical condition. For patients 
who develop postoperative AF, including during follow-up 
postdischarge, rhythm assessment, and possible cardio-
version for the small number who are still in AF, should be 
considered.5,6 Colchicine had been shown to be effective, 
but more recent studies did not confirm this, and gastro-
intestinal adverse effects may be significant.8–10
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is 
well documented.1–4 Calcium channel blockers are 
an option for rate control when beta blockers are 
ineffective.5
 2. The use of rate control or rhythm control are both 
acceptable options in hemodynamically stable 
patients because neither has a distinct clinical 
advantage over the other based on a randomized 
study that included 529 patients. In this study, 
patients in the rhythm-control group received 
amiodarone.5,6 3. Cardioversion of patients with sustained post-
operative AF is regularly performed, especially 
for those patients with hemodynamically poorly 
tolerated AF. Cardioversion is routinely com-
bined with pharmacological therapy, especially 
amiodarone.5,6
 4. A review of 8 observational studies that included 
15 335 patients found a protective impact on the 
mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in 
thromboembolic events in patients with postop-
erative AF treated with anticoagulants.7 In general, 
the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 
days; in the randomized trial of rate control versus 
rhythm control, if patients remained in AF or had 
recurrent AF 48 hours after randomization, antico-
agulation was recommended to be continued for 
60 days, unless complications occurred. Patients 
should be evaluated before discontinuation to 
determine underlying rhythm, especially those at 
high risk for stroke.
 5. The need for a rhythm-control strategy should 
be evaluated postdischarge. Patients who toler-
ate rate control can be followed and often convert 
spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks. A net advan-
tage of rate control is earlier discharge in hemo-
dynamically stable patients. Those who do not 
convert can be managed accordingly with rhythm-
control strategy.5,6

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF who are identified in the setting  
of acute medical illness or surgery should be coun-
seled about the significant risk of recurrent AF after 
the acute illness is resolved.1–6
2a B-NR 2. In patients with AF who are identified in the setting  
of acute medical illness or surgery, outpatient follow-
up for thromboembolic risk stratification and  
decision-making on OAC initiation or continuation,  
as well as AF surveillance, can be beneficial given a 
high risk of AF recurrence.4–9
2b B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are identified in the setting  
of critical illness due to sepsis, the benefits of  
anticoagulation during critical illness for stroke pre-
vention are uncertain.10,11
Synopsis
AF identified in the setting of hospitalization for acute 
noncardiac illness (acute AF), including patients who 
are critically ill, may represent new-onset AF that has 
been detected and treated for the first time. Incidence 
ranges from 1% to 46% in medical illness,1,12–14 with 6% 
to 22% in severe sepsis,15 and 3% to 16% after non-
cardiac surgery.16 AF can be an incidental finding dur-
ing low-risk procedures but can occur associated with 
a range of conditions, including critical illness or sepsis. 
A combination of underlying arrhythmogenic substrate 
and triggers related to the acute illness likely contribute 
to acute AF. Acute AF can be paroxysmal or persistent, 
with or without symptoms, and is associated with higher 
risk of AF recurrence.1–3 Acute AF is also associated 
with prolonged hospitalization13,14 as well as increased 
morbidity12,15 and mortality.13,15 Management of acute AF 
is directed toward detection and treatment of potential 
triggers, optimizing hemodynamics, rate and/or rhythm 
control, and reducing in-hospital and long-term risk of 
stroke. Rate- or rhythm-control strategy should be indi-
vidualized, balancing the impact of rapid rates and atrio-
ventricular dyssynchrony on hemodynamics with ability 
to tolerate treatment. Decisions regarding initiating anti-
coagulation should be based on risk stratification of pa-
tient substrate and comorbidities, and the timing should 
take into consideration bleeding risks and the complex-
ity of the acute illness.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In patients who develop or are discovered to 
have AF in the setting of acute medical illness 
and noncardiac surgery, recurrent AF was noted 
in 42% to 68%1,2 and 39%,3 respectively, during 
5-year follow-up. Regardless of presence of an initial precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with 
increased risks of HF (HR, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39-
3.15]; P<0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30-
1.90]; P<0.001), and mortality (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 
2.70-3.24]; P<0.001).2
 2. In 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF 
(67 .9±–9.9 years, 41% women) identified from 
a longitudinal database, 19% of patients had an 
acute AF precipitant, the most common being 
cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and 
noncardiac surgery (15%). AF recurrence at 5 
years was 41% among those with a precipitant 
versus 52% in those without one (adjusted HR, 
0.75 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; P <0.001) (Figure 27).3 
Regardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was 
associated with increased risk of HF (HR, 2.74 
[95% CI, 2.39-3.15]; P <0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 
[95% CI, 1.30-1.90]; P <0.001), and death (HR, 
2.96 [95% CI, 2.70-3.24]; P <0.001). In patients 
with acute AF after cardiac surgery, observational 
studies show that those who underwent continu-
ous rhythm monitoring had a higher detection 
of AF.4–6 No randomized clinical trial has specifi-
cally compared different monitoring strategies 
for outpatient follow-up of patients with acute 
AF. However, parallels could be drawn from stud-
ies like the CRYSTAL-AF8 and SEARCH-AF 
(Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac 
Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation)9 trials, which 
showed increased sensitivity for AF detection 
with long-term monitoring. Close outpatient fol-
low-up with consideration of heart rhythm moni-
toring and thromboembolic risk stratification is 
important considering the high risk of AF recur-
rence in these patients, especially in those who 
underwent noncardiac surgery and with risk fac-
tors for stroke in whom the AF is likely to recur 
(Figure 28). The optimal frequency, duration, and 
type of rhythm monitoring for patients with acute 
AF remain unclear and need further study.
 3. In a retrospective cohort study of 38 582 patients 
with AF and sepsis admitted to US hospitals from 
July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, 13 611 patients 
(35.3%) received parenteral anticoagulation for 
AF. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was a poor pre-
dictor of acute stroke risk, and parenteral anti-
coagulation did not reduce stroke risk (1.3% 
versus 1.4%; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]) and 
was associated with an increased risk of clinically 
significant bleeding (8.6% versus 7 .2%; RR, 1.21 
[95% CI, 1.10-1.32]). Risk of stroke did not dif-
fer whether patients had preexisting AF and new

Recommendation for Hyperthyroidism
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendation 
1 B-NR 1. In patients with hyperthyroidism and AF who have an 
elevated risk of stroke based on a standard clinical 
risk score, anticoagulation is recommended until  
thyroid function has returned to normal and sinus 
rhythm can be maintained.1,2
Synopsis
Hyperthyroidism, defined as elevated blood levels of thy-
roid hormone with reduced levels of thyroid- stimulating 
hormone, is relatively common and may not lead to overt 
symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.3,4 Patients with hyperthyroid-
ism are at increased risk of developing AF,5 which resolves 
in most cases after the restoration of the euthyroid state 
with effective antithyroid treatment.6,7 Excess thyroid hor-
mone increases sensitivity to catecholamines,3,8 and beta 
blockers reduce symptoms and tachycardia in patients 
with hyperthyroidism.9–12 Nonselective beta blockers may 
reduce the systemic symptoms of hyperthyroidism a bit 
more than beta-1–selective agents do, and propranolol 
reduces the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.10,13 Al-
though it is uncertain whether hyperthyroidism is an inde-
pendent risk factor for stroke, many patients have other 
risk factors that elevate stroke risk, and anticoagulation 
reduces risk of stroke to a similar extent among patients 
with and without hyperthyroidism.1,2,14 Restoration of si-
nus rhythm is unlikely until a euthyroid state has been 
achieved15 and, in 1 study, spontaneous reversion to sinus 
rhythm occurred at a median of 1 to 3 weeks after thyroid 
hormone levels returned to normal.6
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Patients with hyperthyroidism often have labora-
tory findings that suggest hypercoagulability,16 but 
it is uncertain whether this translates into a higher 
risk of stroke.1,17 Nevertheless, patients with 
hyperthyroidism are commonly at elevated risk of 
stroke due to other clinical factors, so anticoagu-
lation should be considered using the framework 
in Section 6.3.1 (“Antithrombotic Therapy”). A 
Danish national registry study found that patients 
with thyrotoxicosis and AF had a lower overall risk 
of thromboembolic events but a similar reduction 
in the risk of thromboembolic events from antico-
agulation compared with patients who did not have 
a secondary cause of AF.5 In a large, randomized 
trial of apixaban versus warfarin, patients with a 
history of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism had 
risk of stroke similar to that of patients with no 
history of thyroid disease, and the effectiveness 
of apixaban in reducing stroke was consistent 
across subgroups with and without a history of 
thyroid disease.1610.12. Pulmonary Disease
Recommendations for Pulmonary Disease
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
2a B-R 1. In patients with AF and COPD, it is reasonable  
to use cardioselective beta blockers for rate control 
of AF, especially where other indications exist  
(eg, MI and HF).1–3
2a B-NR 2. In patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) with 
pulmonary vascular disease and AF or AFL, a  
rhythm-control strategy is reasonable to improve  
functional status and potentially prolong survival.4–12
Synopsis
Pulmonary disease is commonly associated with arrhyth-
mias. AF is common in COPD and is associated with an 
increased risk of mortality and bleeding.13 The combina-
tion of AF and asthma is less common, and beta blockers 
are generally avoided to prevent bronchospasm. A bidi-
rectional relationship is seen between AF and pulmonary 
embolus (PE), although it is little studied. The risk of PE 
is increased in patients with AF.14 AF may also compli-
cate acute PE, where it is a marker of increased risk of 
mortality.15 Whether AF in the setting of PE should influ-
ence the intensity or duration of anticoagulation, or is as-
sociated with future AF recurrence, is unknown. AF and 
other supraventricular arrhythmias are important causes 
of decompensation in patients with PH, which is espe-
cially well described in World Health Organization groups 
1 and 4. A successful rhythm-control strategy is associ-
ated with better outcomes in these patients.

 1. AF is common in patients with COPD, with a 
prevalence of 11% in a large European registry.16 
Furthermore, patients with COPD often have other 
concomitant heart disease. Because beta-2 ago-
nists can be used for the treatment of COPD, there 
has been a reluctance to prescribe beta blockers 
in case these would antagonize beta-2 agonists or 
precipitate bronchospasm.17 However, a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of observational studies 
found that beta-blocker use, for diverse indications 
including HF and CAD, was associated with a sig-
nificantly reduced risk of mortality in patients with 
COPD.1 Another meta-analysis of RCTs assess-
ing the effect of cardioselective beta blockers on 
respiratory function and symptoms did not find any 
change in these parameters or in response to beta-2 
agonists.2 An RCT of patients with advanced COPD 
at risk of severe exacerbation, but without an indi-
cation for beta-blocker treatment, found no differ-
ence in the time to first exacerbation but did find an 
increased risk of severe exacerbation.3 Therefore, 
although other agents can be used for rate control 
of AF (Section 7 , “Rate Control”), beta blockers,

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationespecially cardioselective beta blockers, for treat-
ment of AF need not be avoided when indicated, 
especially in patients with less than severe COPD. 
However, beta blockers can exacerbate reactive air-
way disease and are generally avoided in that set-
ting, such as in patients with asthma.
 2. Atrial arrhythmias are common in PH with pulmonary 
vascular disease (PHPVD; hemodynamically defined 
as PH with increased pulmonary vascular resis-
tance and normal left heart filling pressures, typical 
of World Health Organization group 1 but also of 
groups 3 and 4). Right atrial contraction accounts 
for a significantly greater proportion of total right 
heart function in patients with PHPVD than in nor-
mal subjects,18 and the onset of atrial arrhythmia is 
frequently associated with clinical deterioration.4–12 
Restoration of sinus rhythm results in improvement, 
whereas persistent arrhythmia or recurrence is asso-
ciated with mortality.4,8,9 Pharmacological rhythm 
control and cardioversion have both been used, 
although negative inotropy may limit antiarrhythmic 
drug therapy. Catheter ablation of typical AFL has 
been well described in patients with PHPVD, with 
acceptable results and safety, as well as improve-
ment in clinical and hemodynamic parameters.5,7,12 
LA ablation has also been described, although the 
possibility of creating a right-to-left shunt should 
always be considered when planning transseptal 
puncture. Anesthetic management is also complex, 
and these patients are best cared for by centers with 
extensive clinical expertise in these conditions.
10.13. Pregnancy
Recommendations for Pregnancy
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplement. 
COR LOE Recommendations 
1 B-NR 1. In pregnant patients with AF, DCCV is safe to the 
patient and fetus and should be performed in the 
same manner as in patients who are not pregnant.1
2b C-LD 2. In pregnant individuals with structurally normal hearts and 
hemodynamically stable AF, pharmacological cardioversion 
with agents with history of safe use in pregnancy, such as 
intravenous procainamide, may be considered.1,2
2a C-LD 3. In pregnant individuals with AF and without structural 
heart disease, antiarrhythmic agents with history of 
safe use in pregnancy (eg, flecainide and sotalol) are 
reasonable for maintenance of sinus rhythm.1,2
2a B-NR 4. In pregnant individuals with persistent AF, rate-control 
agents with a record of safety in pregnancy, such 
as beta blockers (eg, propranolol or metoprolol) and 
digoxin, either alone or in combination with beta  
blockers, are reasonable as first-line agents.1,2
2b C-LD 5. Pregnant individuals with AF and elevated risk of 
stroke may be considered for anticoagulation with  
the recognition that no anticoagulation strategy is 
completely safe for both the mother and fetus, and  
an SDM discussion should take place regarding  
risks to both mother and fetus (Table 28).3Synopsis
The incidence of atrial arrhythmias is rising in pregnancy, 
and data from the national inpatient sample suggest that 
this is largely driven by increasing incidence of AF, with a 
reported frequency of 27 per 100 000 hospitalizations.4 
The incidence of AF/AFL in pregnant patients with heart 
disease is 1.3%, with a peak occurrence between 23 and 
30 weeks gestation.5,6 Hospitalizations during pregnancy 
for arrhythmias are associated with an increased risk of 
maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. AF during preg-
nancy is associated with increased maternal mortality 
(OR, 13.13 [95% CI, 7 .77-22.21]; P<0.0001).9
Atrial arrhythmias may manifest for the first time dur-
ing pregnancy; however, AF is usually associated with 
underlying structural or CHD. Factors associated with 
an increased incidence of AF in pregnant individuals 
include advanced maternal age,6 African American race, 
lower socioeconomic status, and left-sided obstructive 
lesions.4,5 Obesity is associated with the development 
of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which is also a 
known risk factor for AF.7 Another potential mechanism 
for development of AF in pregnancy is the cardiogastric 
interaction that occurs with elevated progesterone levels, 
leading to gastroesophageal reflux disease.8
In patients deemed to be at high risk of stroke, rec-
ommendations for anticoagulation in pregnancy are 
extrapolated from experience in managing VHD. DOACs 
are contraindicated during pregnancy and during breast-
feeding because of a lack of data to support their safety 
and efficacy in this patient population.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. Rapid atrioventricular conduction may have serious 
hemodynamic consequences for both mother and 
fetus.9 DCCV of AF in pregnant individuals is safe 
for both mother and fetus and should be performed 
within 48 hours of presentation to minimize risk of 
stroke.1 Appropriate sedation should be provided to 
the pregnant individuals before DCCV. Fetal monitor-
ing is generally used during and directly after DCCV.
 2. Antiarrhythmic drugs are used in pregnancy for 
both maternal and fetal conditions; therefore, their 
mechanisms and adverse effect profile must be 
tolerable to both mother and fetus. These medi-
cations should be avoided if possible during the 
first trimester, and initiation of the drug should be 
attempted at the lowest dose with involvement 
of an electrophysiologist or cardiologist skilled in 
the management of arrhythmias in pregnancy.10 
Intravenous ibutilide has been used effectively 
in pregnant women with refractory AF, although 
published reports included a very small number of 
patients. In a pregnant patient presenting with AF 
and manifest preexcitation, intravenous procain-
amide is also an option.11

hearts and AF, rhythm-control strategies may include

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationagents with a long record of safety (eg, flecainide 
and sotalol) with appropriate monitoring that includes 
surveillance ECGs.1,12 Amiodarone is generally 
avoided and reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias 
because of potential toxicities to the fetus, including 
goiter, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, bradycar-
dia, delayed growth, and premature birth.10,12
 4. In pregnant individuals with persistent AF, rate-
control strategies may include beta blockers with 
long record of safety in pregnancy (propranolol, 
metoprolol) or digoxin. Atenolol is generally avoided 
in pregnancy due to concerns about intrauterine 
growth retardation. Serum digoxin levels may be 
unreliable in pregnancy as digoxin-like immunore-
active substances are increased in pregnant indi-
viduals and react with antibodies against digoxin, 
interfering with the radioassay used for detection 
of digoxin serum levels.13
 5. Tools available to predict stroke risk in AF have not 
been validated in pregnancy. In the rare case of AF 
with no risk factors or signs of heart disease, antico-
agulation may not be necessary.1,14 SDM should be 
used when considering anticoagulation during preg-
nancy (Table 28). Some patients may be deemed at 
high risk for stroke, such as those with mitral steno-
sis, for which recommendations for anticoagulation 
in pregnancy are extrapolated from experience in 
managing VHD. Warfarin may be administered in the 
first trimester providing the dose needed to achieve 
a therapeutic INR is ≤ 5 mg. If the dose of warfarin 
is >5 mg/day, low-molecular-weight heparin should 
be administered throughout the first trimester and 
then transitioned to warfarin for the remainder of 
the antenatal period until 36 hours before a planned 
delivery, at which time unfractionated heparin is started.15 Vaginal delivery should be advised for most 
women, and VKAs are generally held to mitigate risk 
of bleeding compliciations.13 Use of novel DOACs is 
not recommended during pregnancy in view of lack 
of evidence about safety.16

1 C-LD 1. In patients with cancer and AF, multidisciplinary com-
munication including cardiology, oncology and other 
clinicians, and SDM with the patient is recommended 
to optimize cancer and AF treatment and to reduce 
the risk of drug-drug interactions, QTc prolongation, 
proarrhythmia, bleeding, and thromboembolism.1–3
2a C-LD 2. In patients who are to be initiated on cancer  
therapies associated with an increased risk of  
developing AF, increased vigilance for incident AF 
and treatment of contributing factors is reasonable  
to decrease morbidity.1,4–6
2a B-NR 3. In most patients with AF and cancer (remote  
history or receiving active cancer treatment),  
DOACs are reasonable to choose over VKAs for 
stroke risk reduction.7,8
Synopsis
Patients with cancer have an increased risk of AF. A Dan-
ish nationwide study observed an incident AF rate of  
17 .4 per 1000 person-years compared with 3.7 per 1000 
person-years in patients without cancer.9 A meta-analysis 
of observational studies demonstrated the risk of AF to 
be ∼47% higher in patients with cancer compared with 
patients without cancer.5,10 The increased risk of AF is like-
ly related to increased age, shared risk factors between 
cancer and CVD (eg, obesity and systemic inflammation), 
coexistent comorbidities (eg, hypertension and HF), car-
diac involvement by the tumor, as well as certain medical 
therapeutics (Table 29), oncologic surgery, especially tho-
racic, and thoracic radiation therapy.11,12 New-onset AF in 
patients with cancer is associated with a higher risk of HF, 
thromboembolism, bleeding, and mortality.13–15 Notably, 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, such as ibruti-
nib, which are used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
and lymphoproliferative malignancies and often used for 
an extended period of time, are associated with a higher 
risk of AF due to off-target cardiac effects.16 In 1 meta-
analysis, the risk of AF with use of ibrutinib was 4 times 
higher compared with that without use of ibrutinib.17
Although patients with cancer are underrepresented 
in the major trials comparing DOACs to VKAs, large 
observational studies and meta-analyses of studies of 
patients with cancer and AF have demonstrated similar 
or lower rates of ischemic stroke and bleeding in patients 
taking DOACs compared with warfarin.7,8 Patients with Table 28. Anticoagulation Strategies During Pregnancy

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationAF and cancer are at an increased risk for major bleed-
ing.18 They also are commonly on antineoplastic agents, 
which may have important drug interactions with OACs.19 
Thus, these factors should be carefully considered in 
determining indication and choice of OAC.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. In patients with cancer who develop AF in the pres-
ence of cancer therapeutics associated with an 
increased risk of incident AF (Table 29), the first 
approach usually consists of optimizing AF con-
trol while continuing cancer therapy. However, if 
AF control cannot be achieved, decisions regard-
ing dose reduction of the cancer therapy or even 
stoppage can only be made in concert with the 
oncology team and SDM with the patient. Drug-
drug interactions between cancer, antiarrhythmic, 
rate-control, and anticoagulant therapies are com-
mon and require close attention.1 For example, in 
the case of BTK inhibitors, CYP3A inhibitors such 
as amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, and diltia-
zem are usually avoided, due to the associated risk 
of elevation in ibrutinib levels.1 Further, ibrutinib can 
raise levels of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate.1 
Therefore, beta blockers are considered the best option for rate control in BTK inhibitor-associated 
AF. If additional agents are needed for AF control, 
any concomitant reduction in dose of ibrutinib is 
guided by oncology.1 Further, QTc prolongation, 
which is more common in patients with cancer due 
to several cancer therapies, antiemetics, antibiotics, 
and electrolyte derangements, can be further exac-
erbated by QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic agents.3 
Structured screening by pharmacists for potential 
drug-drug interactions could provide benefit.2
 2. Certain medical cancer therapies can increase the 
risk of incident AF (Table 29). Patients with cancer 
and AF are older and have higher rates of hyperten-
sion, MI, and HF compared with those who do not 
develop AF.13–15 The development of perioperative 
AF has been strongly associated with perioperative 
complications.20 In general, patients with cancer and 
CVD may be undertreated with GDMT or less often 
referred to specialists for cardiovascular care.21 
Optimization of cardiovascular conditions such as 
hypertension and HF may decrease the risk of inci-
dent AF, AF recurrence, and of major adverse car-
diovascular events, including stroke.22–25 Therefore,

previous history of AF, who are to be started on Table 29. Medical Cancer Therapy Associated With Increased Risk of AF (>1%)

Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationcancer therapies associated with a higher risk of 
AF, evaluation and optimization of cardiovascular 
risk factors or disease by a cardiologist could be 
beneficial in decreasing incident and recurrent AF 
and associated cardiovascular events, although no 
data are available specifically in patients with can-
cer. Furthermore, elevated natriuretic peptides or a 
history of previous AF can identify patients at higher 
risk of AF after major thoracic cancer surgery.26,27
 3. No large RCTs are available that compare DOACs 
to warfarin in patients with AF and cancer. A meta-
analysis of post-hoc analyses of RCTs and ret-
rospective observational studies that compared 
DOACs with warfarin in patients with AF and can-
cer (n=229 221) demonstrated a lower risk of 
stroke or systemic embolism (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 
0.52-0.81]; P=0.001) and major bleeding (RR, 
0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P=0.01) with DOACs.8 
This meta-analysis included post hoc analyses of 
patients with cancer and AF from the ROCKET AF 
(rivaroxaban versus warfarin), ENGAGE TIMI-48 
(edoxaban versus warfarin), and ARISTOTLE (apix-
aban versus warfarin) trials. These findings were 
consistent in patients defined as having active can-
cer, although definitions of active cancer varied by 
study. An additional large retrospective observation 
study comparing DOACs to warfarin in patients 
with active cancer demonstrated a lower risk of the 
composite endpoint of ischemic stroke/intracranial 
bleeding in patients taking DOACs compared with 
VKA (adjusted HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88]).7 
Although most of the data in this patient population 
came from retrospective observational studies that 
may be prone to selection bias, findings are largely 
consistent with post hoc analyses from RCTs and 
the major RCTs comparing DOACs with VKA in 
general. Special consideration should be given to 
patient bleeding risk and antineoplastic drug inter-
actions in this patient population (Table 30).18,19
10.15. CKD and Kidney Failure
CKD and kidney failure (formerly end-stage renal disease) 
share common risk factors with AF, such as hypertension 
and diabetes, and unsurprisingly, CKD and AF are associ-
ated in a disproportionate manner. In population studies, 
baseline serum creatinine, eGFR, and proteinuria were 
strongly associated with incident of AF during follow-
up.1,2 AF at baseline also predicted new renal dysfunction 
or proteinuria, suggesting a bidirectional relationship be-
tween CKD and AF.2 In an insurance database of 206 229 
adults with confirmed CKD, over a mean follow-up of 5 
years, there was a 67% increased rate of kidney failure 
among patients with CKD who developed incident AF 
compared with those without AF, even after adjustment 
for baseline factors.3 Data on the management of AF in patients with CKD is limited because the major trials of 
rate control, rhythm control, and catheter ablation have 
generally not reported eGFR or CKD as a baseline vari-
able or excluded such patients. Antiarrhythmic drug doses 
are adjusted based on pharmacokinetic data and clinical 
experience, with amiodarone being the only drug that does 
not require dose adjustment in patients with CKD or those 
receiving dialysis. Catheter ablation is feasible, although 
particular attention must be paid to fluid balance when us-
ing irrigated radiofrequency catheters. Anticoagulation in 
patients with CKD and AF is covered in Section 6.8.4 
(“Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD]/Kidney Failure”).

tion, 3 observational studies have compared OAC therapy 
in patients with liver disease to those without liver dis-
ease.5–7 In general, anticoagulation has been associated 
with lower risks of ischemic stroke or thromboembolism 
but was also associated with a significantly higher risk 
of major bleeding or ICH compared with no oral antico-
agulation therapy in patients with AF and liver disease. 
Oral factor Xa inhibitors undergo hepatic metabolism, and 
impaired liver function may increase their plasma concen-
trations and the risk of bleeding. Pivotal clinical trials for 
DOACs excluded patients with active liver disease. Four 
postmarketing retrospective studies and 2 meta-analyses 
have evaluated the comparison between DOACs and 
VKAs in this population, and they showed DOACs were 
associated with a lower risk of major bleeding or ICH.1,7–11 
Limited data exist on the safety of DOAC in severe liv-
er disease. The uses of DOACs based on a Child-Pugh 
Score are summarized in Table 13 (Section 6.3.1.1. “Con-
siderations in Managing Anticoagulation”).
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
 1. A meta-analysis showed that VKA use was sig-
nificantly associated with lower risks of ischemic 
stroke or thromboembolism but was also associ-
ated with significantly higher risks of major bleed-
ing or ICH in patients with AF and liver disease 
compared with no oral anticoagulation therapy.7 
A large-scale retrospective study also corrobo-
rated that OAC use was significantly associated 
with a lower risk of stroke or all-cause mortality 
in patients with AF and cirrhosis.3 VKA use in the 
liver fibrosis group was associated with a higher 
risk of the composite cardiovascular events and 
major bleeding than in the nonliver fibrosis group.4 
However, no significant difference in the composite 
cardiovascular events and major bleeding between 
the 2 groups receiving DOACs was found. The 
efficacy and safety of VKAs or DOACs were not 
affected by nonalcohol fatty liver disease status.5 
The subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis found 
that the risk of major bleeding was not affected by 
the presence of esophageal varices.13
 2. A meta-analysis found no significant difference in 
the risk of ischemic stroke and thromboembolism 
between DOACs and VKAs (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.36-
1.88]; P=0.64) in patients with almost exclusively mild-
to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A-B), but 
DOAC use was associated with lower risks of major 
bleeding (OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38-0.75]; P =0.0003) 
and ICH (OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.23-0.53]; P <0.0001) compared with the warfarin group.7 Another meta-
analysis showed that, in patients with exclusively 
mild-to-moderate cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score A-B), 
DOAC use was associated with lower risks of isch-
emic stroke (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.10-0.90]), major 
bleeding (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57-0.72]), or ICH (HR, 
0.49 [95% CI, 0.40-0.59]) compared with warfarin.11 
DOACs are reasonable oral anticoagulation agents in 
patients with AF and mild-to-moderate liver disease 
(Child-Pugh class A-B). However, data on DOACs are 
lacking on patients with AF and severe liver disease 
(Child-Pugh class C).
 3. Rivaroxaban is currently avoided in patients with mod-
erate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B). Rivaroxaban 
AUC significantly increased by 2.27-fold after a sin-
gle dose of rivaroxaban 10 mg in patients with mod-
erate liver disease compared with healthy subjects.12 
Although the FDA labeling recommends avoiding 
edoxaban in patients with moderate liver disease due 
to the concern of underlying coagulopathy, the edox-
aban AUC was not significantly increased after a 
single dose of edoxaban 15 mg in patients with mod-
erate liver disease compared with healthy subjects.14 
Apixaban AUC was not significantly increased after 
a single dose of apixaban 5 mg in subjects with mild 
and moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A and 
B) compared with healthy subjects.15 Dabigatran 
AUC was also not significantly different after a single 
dose of dabigatran 150 mg in patients with moder-
ate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B) compared with 
that in healthy subjects.16
11. FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS
Enormous progress and important advances have been 
made in recent years on the understanding of mecha-
nisms and on the prevention and management of AF, in-
cluding substantial progress since the 2014 guideline, 
as well as the 2019 focused update. Although the writ-
ing committee has tried to make significant progress in 
this current guideline to address many of the gaps in the 
clinical management of AF, important gaps in knowledge 
remain and are listed below.
 1. AF as a disease continuum: AF must be seen as 
a disease continuum, yet historically the emphasis 
has been on rhythm management. More evidence 
is needed on how to best improve in other aspects 
of AF care, such as prevention, modification of risk 
factors, and how to incorporate holistic approaches 
to AF management into daily clinical practice.
 2. Downstream consequences: The downstream 
consequences of AF over the long term must be 
better studied and defined. Most studies generally 
focus on short-term effects of therapy, usually 6 to 
12 months. Many long-term consequences of AF

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESJanuary 2, 2024 Circulation. 2024;149:e1–e156. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000001193 e112
Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillationremain poorly characterized, such as dementia and 
valvular insufficiency.
 3. Better goal and outcome definition: Historically, 
ablation failure has been defined as having 30 
seconds of AF identified during a follow-up period. 
However, that number might be too simplistic 
because AF burden may be a more important met-
ric and because the 30-second metric might not 
reflect significant burden reduction that may be 
observed in many patients. Patient-oriented out-
comes would also be more important, such as QOL.
 4. Role of risk modifiers in AF stroke prevention: 
Great variation exists in risk of stroke depending on 
nonbinary or dynamic risk factors. Y et it is unclear 
how to best manage patients accordingly. For 
example, how should risk of stroke be assessed in 
a person with hypertension in whom the BP is very 
well controlled? Or, perhaps, how do we incorpo-
rate AF burden on the risk calculation?
 5. Individualization of AF and stroke risk: Although 
some studies have demonstrated an effective role 
of biomarkers in predicting AF and stroke, how 
to incorporate these findings into clinical practice 
remains elusive. Similarly, how to incorporate other 
clinical markers of atrial cardiopathy into clinical 
practice must be better defined, as well as clari-
fication as to how these nontraditional risk factors 
help better stratify patient risk.
 6. Incorporating other stroke risk scores: The ubiq-
uitous nature and simplicity of the CHA2DS2-VASc 
score have diminished with consideration of other 
scores of potential utility, better c-statistics, and 
with potential advantages in particular populations. 
Additional studies are needed to better take advan-
tage of scores for specific groups, scores that could 
potentially be incorporated into the electronic medi-
cal record, and perhaps some with the potential ben-
efit of better discriminating the true low-risk patients.
 7. Surgical exclusion and LAAO: Increasingly avail-
able evidence has demonstrated the benefit of sur-
gical LAA exclusion for stroke prevention, but the 
most scientifically rigorous trials included patients 
who received concomitant anticoagulation. More 
evidence is needed on the magnitude of benefit of 
LAA exclusion in preventing stroke in patients who 
have contraindications to anticoagulation and how 
to best manage those patients around rhythm-con-
trol interventions, such as cardioversion. Clinicians 
would also like to see additional data on pLAAO, 
particularly peri-implant stroke management and 
longer-term outcomes in patients in whom peripro-
cedure anticoagulation is not possible.
 8. Subclinical AF: What magnitude of AF burden 
mandates stroke prevention therapy in patients with 
subclinical AF must be better defined. Certainly, 
large general risk categories have been identified, and general guidelines exist, but extensive practice 
variations remain, and more precise recommenda-
tions for the community are needed. In addition, the 
role and impact on outcomes of AF screening in 
general and poststroke should be better defined.
 9. Use and applicability of consumer-based wear-
able heart monitoring devices: These devices 
are now widespread and are used to diagnose and 
monitor response to therapy in patients with AF. 
Validation on the accuracy of the most common 
available technologies is needed. How to best use 
these devices in practice, including for AF screen-
ing, must be better defined.
 10. Standardization of ablation procedures: Great 
practice variation exists on how AF ablation proce-
dures are performed, either as first or repeat proce-
dures. Large registries and more data are required 
to better define standards of care in this field. Many 
interventions, such as extra ablation lines, are still 
performed despite limited data demonstrating effi-
cacy, whereas the best approaches to persistent AF 
and repeat ablation are poorly defined.
 11. Candidates for ablation: We must better identify 
clinical markers to better identify when catheter 
ablation is unlikely to benefit patients and define 
specific criteria for candidacy for first time and 
repeat procedures.
 12. Artificial intelligence for AF management:  
Artificial intelligence could potentially be used 
to better tailor therapy to the individual patient, 
taking into consideration numerous factors that 
may better select candidates for therapeutic 
approaches, such as anticoagulation versus 
LAAO, rhythm versus rate control, catheter abla-
tion versus medical therapy, modification of risk 
factors, genetics, and others.
 13. Strategies for anticoagulation: Ongoing clini-
cal trials are assessing different strategies for 
oral anticoagulation in persons who have under-
gone catheter ablation, including the OCEAN 
(Optimal AntiCoagulation for Enhanced-Risk 
Patients Post-Catheter Ablation for Atrial 
Fibrillation) trial (NCT02168829)1 and ODIn-AF 
(Prevention of Silent Cerebral Thromboembolism 
by Oral Anticoagulation With Dabigatran After 
Pulmonary Vein Isolation for Atrial Fibrillation) 
(NCT02067182)2 trial, because it is unclear in 
whom anticoagulation can be discontinued after 
successful ablation. Several studies also have 
investigated the use of intermittent or continu-
ous rhythm monitoring to guide oral anticoagula-
tion in persons with AF, including those who have 
undergone ablation.3,4 These so-called “PITP” 
or “electrocardiographic-guided” approaches 
are investigational. Ongoing clinical trials like

AND GUIDELINESCirculation. 2024;149:e1–e156. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000001193 January 2, 2024 e113
Joglar et al 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial FibrillationTherapy for Atrial Fibrillation) will help determine 
whether they are suitable for clinical practice. Also, 
anticoagulation/DOAC use in pregnancy needs to 
be investigated because it is currently contraindi-
cated in view of lack of data on safety.
 14. Sleep: Among patients with AF and SDB, the 
impact of treatment of SDB on maintenance of 
sinus rhythm and on general cardiovascular out-
comes remains uncertain. Most studies have been 
observational, which introduces confounding fac-
tors. Once diagnosed, the adherence to treatment 
for SDB is also suboptimal.
 15. SDM and decision aids: Decision aids are per-
ceived as important tools to better inform patients 
about options for AF management; yet, it is unclear 
if those tools improve clinical outcomes. Most deci-
sion aids developed for AF focus on anticoagula-
tion; there is a paucity of validated decision aids, 
including for AF rhythm management using antiar-
rhythmic drugs or ablation.
 16. Genetic testing: The use and applicability of 
consumer-based or targeted genetic testing for 
AF remains uncertain. Polygenic risk scores can 
indicate higher risk for AF, but the use of genetic 
testing to impact clinical surveillance, management, 
and clinical outcomes remains uncertain.
 17 . Race, ethnicity, gender, and sex differences: In 
sexual- and gender-diverse individuals, additional 
research is recommended to identify the inci-
dence and outcomes of AF as well as the impact 
of gender-affirming therapies on arrhythmia inci-
dence and outcomes. Additional data across racial 
and ethnic groups should also be encouraged.
 18. Standardized measures: For patients with AF, a 
standardized measure might be useful to assess 
symptoms and/or QOL and impact of management 
strategies.
 19. SDOH: The measurement and impact of SDOH in 
AF is underutilized and understudied.

ous year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted.
