ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY
www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 138 / 5 / NOVEMBER, 2010   1093      Atrial ﬁ  brillation (AF) is associated with a well-
known increase in ischemic stroke risk,  1   which is 
further increased by individual conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and prior throm-boembolism.  
2   Oral anticoagulation (OAC) dramati-
cally reduces this risk  3   and is therefore recommended 
in patients with AF at moderate-high risk of stroke and thromboembolism.  
4   The increasing incidence 
and prevalence of AF increases the likelihood of OAC use in the AF population, which is usually elderly, and comorbidities commonly coexist.  
5-7   Indeed, clinical decision making about whether OAC is justiﬁ  ed based 
on stroke risk is supported by various practical stroke risk classiﬁ  cation schema that incorporate known 
clinical risk factors.  
4,8   
 However, stroke risk is also closely related to 
bleeding risk,  9   and OAC prescription needs to bal-
ance the beneﬁ  t from stroke prevention against the 
risk of bleeding. Thus, there is often suboptimal   Objective:    Despite extensive use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial ﬁ  brillation 
(AF) and the increased bleeding risk associated with such OAC use, no handy quantiﬁ  cation tool 
for assessing this risk exists. We aimed to develop a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk 
for major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemoglobin decrease  .  2 g/L, and/or transfu-
sion) in a cohort of real-world patients with AF.   Methods:    Based on 3,978 patients in the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up, all 
univariate bleeding risk factors in this cohort were used in a multivariate analysis along with his-
torical bleeding risk factors. A new bleeding risk score termed HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly ( .  65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) was calculated, incorpo-
rating risk factors from the derivation cohort. 
  Results:    Fifty-three (1.5%) major bleeds occurred during 1-year follow-up. The annual bleeding 
rate increased with increasing risk factors. The predictive accuracy in the overall population 
using signiﬁ  cant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups. Application of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics except where patients were receiving antiplatelet agents alone or no antithrombotic therapy, with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively.   Conclusion:    This simple, novel bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) provides a practical tool to assess 
the individual bleeding risk of real-world patients with AF, potentially supporting clinical decision 
making regarding antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF.   CHEST 2010; 138(5):1093–1100

1094 Original Researchstroke. Hemorrhagic stroke was deﬁ  ned as a focal neurologic deﬁ  -
cit of sudden onset, diagnosed by a neurologist, lasting  .  24 h and 
caused by bleeding. Presence of chronic dialysis, renal transplan-
tation, or serum creatinine  /H11350  200  m mol/L was classiﬁ  ed as abnor-
mal kidney function. Abnormal liver function was deﬁ  ned as chronic hepatic disease (eg, cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of signiﬁ  cant 
hepatic derangement (eg, bilirubin  .  2  3  upper limit of normal, 
in association with aspartate aminotransferase/alanine amin-otransferase/alkaline phosphatase  .  3  3  upper limit normal, and so 
forth). Finally, valvular heart disease was deﬁ  ned as the presence 
of any regurgitation or gradient over a valve with hemodynamic signiﬁ  cance and/or related symptoms. 
 Statistical Analysis and Design of a New Bleeding Risk Score 
 Data analysis was performed with SPSS, version 16.0 (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL). The presence of any differences between the 
groups with and without major bleeding during 1-year follow-up was tested by Fisher exact test for categorical variables and by independent samples  t  test for continuous variables. 
 All potential bleeding risk factors identiﬁ  ed from the uni-
variate analyses of the derivation cohort with a  P  value  ,  .10 
(age  .  65 years, female sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, COPD, 
valvular heart disease, kidney failure, prior major bleeding epi-sode, and clopidogrel use), were used in the multivariate logis-tic regression analyses along with more historical bleeding risk factors: OAC, alcohol use, and hypertension. We disregarded thyroid disease ( P   5  .039) because of difﬁ  culties with interpre-
tation (only n  5  10 bleeding events), and this had not been iden-
tiﬁ ed as a bleeding risk in prior systematic reviews.  
11-13   Given 
the persistent nature of the evidence of OAC, hypertension, age  .  65 years, renal failure, alcohol abuse, and prior major 
bleed as bleeding risk factors, these variables were kept in the model at all times. The other, less strongly linked variables were removed stepwise from the model when the  P  value was  .  .10. 
Variables with  P   ,  .05 in the ﬁ  nal model were considered to be 
signiﬁ  cant contributors and were checked for interaction effects, 
which did not exist. 
 In recognition of the limited number of major bleeds and rela-
tively short follow-up period in the Euro Heart Survey on AF, we also added consistent risk factors for major bleeding (stroke, alco-hol use, systolic BP  .  160 mm Hg, and so forth) identiﬁ  ed in 
recent systematic reviews  
11,13   to use the data from the derivation 
cohort to test a new bleeding risk score in a ﬁ  nal statistical model, accepting the lack of statistical signiﬁ  cance of some variables in our derivation cohort. For each of the variables in the ﬁ  nal model 
the regression coefﬁ  cient, net OR, and its 95% CI and  P  value 
are reported ( Table 1  ). We then calculated the C statistic as a measure of the predictive accuracy of the model incorporating bleeding risk factors from the derivation cohort (that is, prior major bleeding, age  .  65 years, clopidogrel use, and kidney failure), 
where, based on their respective multivariate regression coefﬁ  -
cients, two points were awarded for prior major bleeding and one point for each of the other bleeding risk factors. In addition, we report the C statistics in a subgroup analysis of individuals discharged with OAC monotherapy, OAC combined with an antiplate let drug, an antiplatelet drug alone, or no antithrombotic therapy. 
 A new bleeding risk score (termed HAS-BLED) was calcu-
lated, incorporating risk factors from the derivation cohort as well as signiﬁ  cant risk factors for major bleeding found in the literature from systematic reviews.  
11,13     HAS-BLED is an acronym for hyper-
tension (uncontrolled,  .  160 mm Hg systolic), abnormal renal /
liver function (one point for presence of renal or liver impairment, maximum two points), stroke (previous history, particularly lacunar), bleeding history or predisposition (anemia), labile international normalized ratio (INR) (ie, therapeutic time in range  ,  60%), 
elderly (  .  65 years), drugs/alcohol concomitantly (antiplatelet implementation of thromboprophylaxis among patients 
with AF,  9,10   which may be partly due to the lack of a vali-
dated bleeding risk-stratiﬁ  cation schema that is user-friendly.  
11-13   This is further reﬂ  ected by the absence 
of recommendations on bleeding risk assessment in current antithrombotic guidelines for AF manage-ment.  
4,12   The available schemas estimating the risk of 
bleeding associated with use of OAC either do not focus on patients with AF in particular,

17   
Furthermore, all published schema are based on historical cohorts of patients and consequently may not reﬂ  ect advancements in medical care over time 
(for example, OAC monitoring) and treatment of underlying heart disease.  
14-17   Our aim was to develop 
a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk of major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemo-
globin decrease  .  2 g/L, and/or transfusion) in a con-
temporary, real-world cohort of patients with AF. 
 Materials and Methods 
 We used the large population database of the prospective Euro 
Heart Survey on AF, with data collected between 2003 and 2004. 
A detailed study outline of the Euro Heart Survey on AF at base-line  
5   and follow-up assessment  18   has been previously described. 
In summary, 5,333 ambulatory and hospitalized patients with AF from 182 university, nonuniversity, and specialized hospitals among 35 member countries of the European Society of Cardiol-ogy were enrolled. Patients had to be  /H11350  18 years of age and have 
an ECG or Holter-proven diagnosis of AF during the qualifying admission or in the preceding year. A 1-year follow-up assessment was performed to determine survival and major adverse cardio-vascular events, such as major bleeding. Medical records and/or medical information systems were used to populate the data set. 
 We deﬁ  ned major bleeding as any bleeding requiring hospital-
ization and/or causing a decrease in hemoglobin level of  .  2 g/L 
and/or requiring blood transfusion that was not a hemorrhagic

1096 Original Research21 patients with a CHADS 2  score  /H11350  1 discharged 
without OAC who suffered a stroke within 1 year of 
follow-up, only one had a HAS-BLED score outweigh-ing the individual stroke risk. Of the patients with CHADS 
2  score  /H11350  1 who were discharged without 
OAC with a higher HAS-BLED bleeding risk score, all three patients suffered a major bleed. 
 Discussion 
 Using a derivation cohort based on the large, real-
world population of the Euro Heart Survey on AF, we identiﬁ  ed four independent risk factors of major bleed-
ing within 1 year (prior major bleeding, age  .  65 years, 
clopidogrel use, and kidney failure). Incorporating these risk factors with other established risk factors from systematic reviews and multivariate analyses,  
11,13,19    
we developed and tested a novel, user-friendly bleed-ing risk score, HAS-BLED, which demonstrated a good predictive accuracy in the overall Euro Heart survey cohort (C statistic 0.72) but performed par-ticularly well in predicting bleeding risk where anti-platelet therapy was used alone (C statistic 0.91), or no antithrombotic therapy at all (C statistic 0.85). Assessment of both stroke and bleed risk using the CHADS 
2  and HAS-BLED schemas, respectively, in 
the Euro Heart Survey on AF population would have 
resulted in withholding OAC therapy in 12% of the patients who suffered a major bleed within 1 year and the initiation of OAC in 95% of the patients at high 
risk for stroke who were discharged without OAC and had suffered a stroke within 1 year. 
 With the previously published HEMOR 
2 RHAGES 
schema  17   and others,  11,19   the concept of a risk score 
for major bleeding in patients with AF is not new. However, our novel, proposed HAS-BLED score has several key advantages over the previously mentioned bleeding risk stratiﬁ  cation method. First, the shorter 
acronym means that physicians have fewer risk fac-tors to memorize when using the HAS-BLED score, thereby increasing the user-friendliness and sub-sequent clinical application. Furthermore, in con-trast to certain risk factors incorporated into the HEMOR 
2 RHAGES score that require laboratory 
parameters or even genetic testing,  17   all risk factors of 
the HAS-BLED score are either readily available from the clinical medical history or routinely tested in (new) patients with AF. This characteristic strongly supports its use in all health-care settings and is another signiﬁ  cant contributor to its superior user-friendliness. Because less does not necessarily mean more, it is important to note that the predictive accu-racy of the HAS-BLED score is broadly similar when compared with the HEMOR 
2 RHAGES model in 
the overall population (C statistic of 0.72 vs 0.66, in  Table 4  . The risk of major bleeding within 1 year in patients with AF in the Euro Heart Survey determined by the novel bleeding risk score, HAS-BLED, is shown in  Table 5  . The annual bleeding rate increased with the addition of each risk factor from the derivation cohort ( Table 5 ). 
 The corresponding unadjusted bleeding rates in 
patients with OAC, antiplatelet therapy alone, or no antithrombotic treatment were 1.75, 0.97, and 1.42 bleeds per 100 patient-years, respectively. The predictive accuracy in the overall population 
using signiﬁ  cant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups, as shown in  Table 6  . Application 
of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics to that derived in the derivation 
cohort overall (0.72), or when patients were estab-lished on OAC at baseline (0.69), or when patients were on OAC plus antiplatelet therapy at baseline (0.78). HAS-BLED substantially improved the predictive 
accuracy of bleeding risk when patients with AF were receiving antiplatelet therapy alone or in those who were not on antithrombotic therapy at all (with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively). The HEMOR 
2 RHAGES bleeding scheme had a lower pre-
dictive accuracy compared with the new HAS-BLED score, overall or in relation to antithrombotic therapy use, except in the OAC plus antiplatelet therapy sub-group ( Table 6 ). 
 Of all the 33 bleeding events in patients discharged 
with OAC because of a CHADS 
2  (congestive heart 
failure, hypertension, age  .  75 years, diabetes melli-
tus, and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack [doubled]) score  /H11350  1, four (12%) patients had a 
HAS-BLED-based bleeding risk that outweighed their individual stroke risk. Conversely, of all 1,580 patients discharged with OAC because of a CHADS 
2  score  /H11350  1 
who did not suffer a major bleed within 1 year, only 
34 (2.2%) had a HAS-BLED-based bleeding risk 
that outweighed their individual stroke risk. Of all

www.chestpubs.org CHEST / 138 / 5 / NOVEMBER, 2010   1097 of 0.85 vs 0.81, respectively), the HAS-BLED score 
is simpler. This score would be particularly useful in everyday clinical practice, when making decisions on whether OAC can be initiated in a patient newly diag-nosed with AF who is not taking any antithrombotic therapy,  
12   or when antiplatelet therapy (or Nonsteroi-
dal antiinﬂ  ammatory drugs) use is being considered, for example, in the setting of coronary artery disease.  
20   
 As mentioned previously, balancing the individual 
risk of bleeding and stroke is difﬁ  cult  21   but of the utmost 
importance to maximize appropriate anti throm-
botic therapy and minimize adverse events in patients with AF, resulting in a net clinical beneﬁ  t for the treated patient. In daily clinical practice, the CHADS 
2  
index  8   is a widely used tool to stratify stroke risk in 
patients with AF. For now, the HEMOR 2 RHAGES 
score is the only suitable counterpart available to assess the risk of bleeding in AF patients.  
17   Closer examina-
tion of the risk factors composing the CHADS 2  and 
HEMOR 2 RHAGES schemas reveals an extensive 
overlap between risk factors for bleeding and stroke, which has obvious drawbacks.  
8,17   Indeed, the patients 
at highest stroke and thromboembolic risk are par-adoxically more likely to sustain bleeding complica-tions. This may lead to confusion when trying to decide 
on the most appropriate antithrombotic regimen to balance the risks of bleeding against the risk of stroke, thereby limiting the applicability of such schemas. 
 The trade-off in terms of the beneﬁ  ts and risks 
of OAC using the CHADS 
2  index and HAS-BLED 
score demonstrates that in the vast majority of patients with AF who require OAC (CHADS 
2  index  /H11350  2) the 
risk of bleeding outweighs the potential beneﬁ  t of 
OAC if the HAS-BLED bleed score exceeds the indi-vidual CHADS 
2  index. In the case of a CHADS 2  score 
of 1, the HAS-BLED score must exceed 2 for the poten-tial harm caused by OAC to offset its beneﬁ  cial effect respectively).  
17   However, the HAS-BLED score was 
particularly useful when antiplatelet therapy was used alone or no antithrombotic therapy was used at all (C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively). Although the HAS-BLED score and the HEMOR 
2 RHAGES 
model were broadly similar in subjects who were not taking antithrombotic therapy at baseline (C statistics

1098 Original Researchwith AF before it can be widely implemented into daily 
practice. Potential selection bias might have occurred because of 25% missing data regarding the occurrence of major bleeding during the follow-up period. Patients who were lost to follow-up were likely to have had more comorbidities and transferred to nursing homes or even have died, which might have led to underes-timation of the overall bleeding rate. Also, we recog-nize that the limited number of major bleeds and the relatively short follow-up period make it possible that other important risk factors for bleeding were 
not identiﬁ  ed. Indeed, bleeding may occur following 
changes to warfarin (eg, for surgery or interventions such as pacemaker implant) with institution of bridg-ing therapy with low-molecular heparin. We also did not consider thyroid disease in our model, as this had not been identiﬁ  ed as a bleeding risk in prior system-atic reviews  
11-13  ; however, some pathophysiologic plau-
sibility is possible, since hypothyroidism has been described to cause acquired von Willebrand disease associated with low factor VIII levels and platelet dysfunction.  
26   Of note, there is an improved predictive 
power of the HAS-BLED score over the HEMOR 2 -
RHAGES score in patients treated with antiplatelet therapy (or nonsteroidal antiinﬂ  ammatory drugs) or 
no antithrombotic therapy at all ( Table 6 ). 
 The risk of major bleeding (especially intracranial 
hemorrhage) is increased with advanced age.  
26-28   Of 
note, the risk of major hemorrhage can be similar among elderly patients receiving warfarin and aspi-rin.  
29   The relatively small numbers of bleeding events 
and the modest number of very elderly patients in our cohort makes it rather difﬁ  cult to draw too many ﬁ  rm 
conclusions by introducing different weights to differ-ent age categories (eg, one point for age 65-74 years, two points for age 75-84 years, three points for age  /H11350  85 years, and so forth), as well as introducing 
additional complexity to our simple HAS-BLED scoring system. Also, age is a continuous (rather than categorized) risk for bleeding (as well as stroke) and the biologic age of an elderly patient is probably more relevant to bleeding risk than the chronologic age. It must be stressed that in many instances, bleeding risk among the elderly is multifactorial  
30   and is often 
the result of associated comorbidities, high anticoag-ulation intensity, and labile INRs in this population.  
11-13   
The HAS-BLED score already takes some of these aspects into account, allowing cumulative assessment of risk factors for bleeding. In the present analysis, the HAS-BLED score already outperforms the HEMOR 
2 RHAGES bleeding scheme, which was an 
attempt by Gage et al  17   to have a simple method of 
bleeding assessment. Future validation and reﬁ  ne-
ment of HAS-BLED among a huge elderly AF popu-lation with prolonged follow-up may address the issue of age as a continuous variable for bleeding risk. on stroke risk reduction. Appropriate use of this prac-
tical rule in the Euro Heart Survey on AF population could have prevented more than one out of every 10 (4/33) of the major bleeds. However, 34/1,580 (2.2%) of the patients with a CHADS 
2  score  /H11350  1 discharged 
with OAC who did not suffer a major bleed within 1 year would have been denied OAC because of a HAS-BLED bleed risk outweighing their stroke risk. 
 The potential impact on current clinical practice 
of the novel HAS-BLED score is underlined by the recently published Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events-A (ACTIVE-A) trial.  
22   This large random-
ized clinical trial was designed to compare the pre-ventive effect on all-cause vascular events of clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone in patients with AF deemed unsuitable for OAC treatment. In half (n  5   /H11601  3,500) of 
these patients with AF with a high stroke risk, the most common applied classiﬁ  cation was “unsuitable for OAC,” which was solely based on physician clinical judgment, without the presence of any predeﬁ  ned 
risk factor of bleeding or other objective risk scoring. Perhaps this reﬂ  ects physicians’ uncertainty about what to consider as true risk factors of bleeding and their fear of potential iatrogenic harm caused by OAC use. 
 Given the recent promising results of the Random-
ized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Ther-apy (RE-LY) trial,  
23   patients assessed as being at higher 
bleeding risk using the novel HAS-BLED score could be prescribed the lower dose (110 mg bid) of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, which demon-strated a signiﬁ  cant reduction in major bleeding compared with warfarin, with a similar stroke risk reduction to warfarin, whereas those at lower bleed-ing risk could be prescribed dabigatran 150 mg bid, which offers superior efﬁ  cacy but a similar major bleeding risk to warfarin.  
24   Further, the HAS-BLED 
score could also be used to identify patients who may beneﬁ  t from a left atrial appendage occlusion device  
25   
(ie, patients at high risk of ischemic stroke who have such an increased risk of bleeding that OAC is con-traindicated). Thus, physicians initiating OAC (whether with the vitamin K antagonist or new oral anticoagu-lants, such as dabigatran) in a patient with AF could 
use the HAS-BLED score to assess the potential bleeding risk and feel more conﬁ  dent in prescribing OAC as appropriate or refer the patient for implantation of a left atrial appendage occlusion device. Indeed, bleeding risk scores should also be validated in dabig-atran-treated patients, as well as those being con-
sidered for left atrial appendage occlusion devices. 
 Limitations 
 The HAS-BLED score needs to be validated in at 
least one other large contemporary cohort of patients

available when having to decide on starting OAC 
for the ﬁ  rst time in a patient. When on OAC, the INR is often elevated at the time of admission for a bleeding event, but it is unknown which measure of INR control best predicts bleeding in such a manner that clinical action could prevent the bleed-ing. We did not include actual INR values during follow-up but acknowledge its importance as risk factor of bleeding.  
19   Of note, the current alternative 
(HEMOR 2 RHAGES model) was also developed 
without the availability of INR values.  17   
 Conclusion 
 We propose a novel bleeding risk score, HAS-BLED, 
that provides an easy, practical tool to assess the indi-vidual bleeding risk of patients with AF. The use of this simple score may potentially support clinical deci-sion making regarding antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention.
