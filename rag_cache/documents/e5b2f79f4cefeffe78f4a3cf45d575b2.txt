abstractPURPOSE To update the guideline to include new anticancer agents, antiemetics, and antiemetic regimens and
to provide recommendations on the use of dexamethasone as a prophylactic antiemetic in patients receivingcheckpoint inhibitors (CPIs).
METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel and updated the systematic review to include randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs published between June 1, 2016, and January 24, 2020. To addressthe dexamethasone and CPI question, we conducted a systematic review of RCTs that evaluated the addition of
a CPI to chemotherapy.
RESULTS The systematic reviews included 3 publications from the updated search and 10 publications on CPIs.
Two phase III trials in adult patients with non –small-cell lung cancers evaluating a platinum-based doublet with
or without the programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab recommended that all patients receivedexamethasone as a component of the prophylactic antiemetic regimen. In both studies, superior outcomeswere noted in the PD-1 inhibitor –containing arms. Other important ﬁndings address olanzapine in adults and
fosaprepitant in pediatric patients.
RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for adults are unchanged with the exception of the option of adding
olanzapine in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Dosing information now includes the optionof a 5-mg dose of olanzapine in adults and intravenous formulations of aprepitant and netupitant-palonosetron.The option of fosaprepitant is added to pediatric recommendations. There is no clinical evidence to warrantomission of dexamethasone from guideline-compliant prophylactic antiemetic regimens when CPIs are ad-ministered to adults in combination with chemotherapy. CPIs administered alone or in combination with another
CPI do not require the routine use of a prophylactic antiemetic.

INTRODUCTION
The goals of this update are to provide oncologists,
other health care practitioners, patients, and care-
givers recommendations on the use of dexamethasoneas a prophylactic antiemetic in patients receiving
checkpoint inhibitors and information on new anti-
emetics, antiemetic regimens, and anticancer agentemetogenicity.
Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) represent a signi ﬁcant
new therapeutic approach in many cancers. Concerns
have been raised about the potential for concurrentcorticosteroid use to adversely affect the therapeuticefﬁcacy of CPIs through their immunosuppressive
effects. Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid thatis a critical component of a number of antiemetic
guideline –endorsed regimens for use in the prevention
of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.
Theﬁrst ASCO guideline for antiemetics was published
in 1999,
1with updates in 2006,22011,32015,4and
2017.5This update of the 2017 guideline provides
guidance on the use of dexamethasone as a pro-phylactic antiemetic in patients receiving CPIs. Thisguideline update addresses programmed death-1(PD-1), programmed death 1 –ligand (PD-L1), and
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte –associated protein-4 (CTLA-4)
CPIs. Other forms of immunotherapies such as chi-meric antigen receptor T cells were not addressed. Wealso used this opportunity to add new anticancerASSOCIATED

THE BOTTOM LINE
Antiemetics: ASCO Guideline Update
Guideline Question
Should current guideline-endorsed antiemetic regimens that include dexamethasone be modi ﬁed when checkpoint inhibitors
(CPIs) are incorporated in antineoplastic treatment regimens?
Target Population
Adults and children who receive antineoplastic agents and adults who undergo radiation therapy for cancer.
Target Audience
Medical and radiation oncologists, oncology nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, oncology pharmacists, and
patients with cancer.
Methods
An Expert Panel was convened to conduct an update of clinical practice guideline recommendations based on a systematic
review of the medical literature.
Recommendations
Note: For adult patients, the addition of a CPI to chemotherapy does not change the guideline recommendation for an
antiemetic regimen based on the emetogenicity of the agents administered. CPIs administered alone or in combination with
another CPI are minimally emetogenic and do not require the routine use of a prophylactic antiemetic.
Adult Patients
High-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Adults treated with cisplatin and other high-emetic-risk single agents should be offered a 4-drug combination of an NK 1
receptor antagonist, a serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and olanzapine (day 1). Dexamethasone
and olanzapine should be continued on days 2 to 4 (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Adults treated with an anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide should be offered a 4-drug combination of an
NK1receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and olanzapine (day 1). Olanzapine should be
continued on days 2 to 4 (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of rec-
ommendation: strong).
Moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Adults treated with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) $4 mg/mL/min should be offered a 3-drug combination of
an NK 1receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (day 1) (Type: evidence based; bene ﬁts
outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Adults treated with moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents (excluding carboplatin AUC $4 mg/mL/min) should be
offered a 2-drug combination of a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist and dexamethasone (day 1) (Type: evidence based,
bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Adults treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and other moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
known to cause delayed nausea and vomiting may be offered dexamethasone on days 2 to 3 (Type: informal consensus,
bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Adults treated with low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered a single dose of a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist
or a single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before antineoplastic treatment (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Adults treated with minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should not be offered routine antiemetic prophylaxis
(Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Antineoplastic combinations
Adults treated with antineoplastic combinations should be offered antiemetics appropriate for the component anti-
neoplastic agent of greatest emetic risk (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: in-
termediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
Adjunctive drugs
Lorazepam is a useful adjunct to antiemetic drugs but is not recommended as a single-agent antiemetic (Type: informal
consensus; bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Cannabinoids
Evidence remains insuf ﬁcient for a recommendation regarding medical marijuana for the prevention of nausea and
vomiting in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Evidence is also insuf ﬁcient for a rec-
ommendation regarding the use of medical marijuana in place of the tested and US Food and Drug Admin-istration –approved cannabinoids dronabinol and nabilone for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Complementary and alternative therapies
Evidence remains insuf ﬁcient for a recommendation for or against the use of ginger, acupuncture/acupressure, and
other complementary or alternative therapies for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell or bone marrow transplantation
Adults treated with high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell or bone marrow transplantation should be offered a 3-drug
combination of an NK
1receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based,
bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
(New) A 4-drug combination of an NK 1receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and
olanzapine may be offered to adults treated with high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell or bone marrow trans-plantation. (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).
Multiday antineoplastic therapy
Adults treated with multiday antineoplastic agents should be offered antiemetics before treatment that are appropriate
for the emetic risk of the antineoplastic agent given on each day of the antineoplastic treatment and for 2 days aftercompletion of the antineoplastic regimen (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: in-
termediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Adults treated with 4- or 5-day cisplatin regimens should be offered a 3-drug combination of an NK
1receptor antagonist,
a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Breakthrough nausea and vomiting
For patients with breakthrough nausea or vomiting, clinicians should re-evaluate emetic risk, disease status, concurrent
illnesses, and medications; and ascertain that the best regimen is being administered for the emetic risk (Type: informalconsensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Adults who experience nausea or vomiting despite optimal prophylaxis and who did not receive olanzapine pro-
phylactically should be offered olanzapine in addition to continuing the standard antiemetic regimen (Type: evidence
based; bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Adults who experience nausea or vomiting despite optimal prophylaxis and who have already received olanzapine may
be offered a drug of a different class (eg, an NK1 receptor antagonist, lorazepam or alprazolam, a dopamine receptorantagonist, dronabinol, or nabilone) in addition to continuing the standard antiemetic regimen (Type: informal con-sensus; bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate for dronabinol and nabilone, low otherwise; Strength of
recommendation: moderate).
Anticipatory nausea and vomiting
All patients should receive the most active antiemetic regimen appropriate for the antineoplastic agents being ad-
ministered. Clinicians should use such regimens with initial antineoplastic treatment rather than assessing the patient ’s
emetic response with less-effective antiemetic treatment. If a patient experiences anticipatory emesis, clinicians mayoffer behavioral therapy with systematic desensitization (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
High-emetic-risk radiation therapy
Adults treated with high-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered a 2-drug combination of a 5-HT 3receptor
antagonist and dexamethasone before each fraction and on the day after each fraction, if radiation therapy is notplanned for that day (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recom-
mendation: strong).
Moderate-emetic-risk radiation therapy
Adults treated with moderate-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered a 5-HT
3receptor antagonist before each
fraction, with or without dexamethasone, before the ﬁrst 5 fractions (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms;
Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Low-emetic-risk radiation therapy
Adults treated with radiation therapy to the brain should be offered breakthrough dexamethasone therapy. Patients who
are treated with radiation therapy to the head and neck, thorax, or pelvis should be offered breakthrough therapy witha 5-HT
3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or a dopamine-receptor antagonist (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts
outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).
Minimal-emetic-risk radiation therapy
Adults treated with minimal-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered breakthrough therapy with a 5-HT 3receptor
antagonist, dexamethasone, or a dopamine-receptor antagonist (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms;
Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).
Concurrent radiation and antineoplastic agent therapy
Adults treated with concurrent radiation and antineoplastic agents should receive antiemetic therapy appropriate for the
emetic risk level of the antineoplastic agents, unless the risk level of the radiation therapy is higher. During periods whenprophylactic antiemetic therapy for the antineoplastic agents has ended and ongoing radiation therapy would normallybe managed with its own prophylactic therapy, patients should receive prophylactic therapy appropriate for the emeticrisk of the radiation therapy until the next period of antineoplastic therapy, rather than receiving breakthrough therapy forthe antineoplastic agents as needed (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: in-
termediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Pediatric Patients
High-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
(Updated) Pediatric patients treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered a 3-drug combination
of a 5-HT
3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant or fosaprepitant (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts
outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).
(Updated) Pediatric patients treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents who are unable to receive aprepitant or
fosaprepitant should be offered a 2-drug combination of a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist and dexamethasone (Type
evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).
(Updated) Pediatric patients treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents who are unable to receive dexa-
methasone should be offered a 2-drug combination of palonosetron and aprepitant or fosaprepitant (Type: evidencebased, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Pediatric patients treated with moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered a 2-drug combination of
a 5-HT
3receptor antagonist and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).
(Updated) Pediatric patients treated with moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents who are unable to receive
dexamethasone should be offered a 2-drug combination of a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist and aprepitant or fosaprepitant
(Type: evidence based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: weak).
Low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Pediatric patients treated with low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered ondansetron or granisetron
(Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).

GUIDELINE QUESTION
Should current guideline-endorsed antiemetic regimens
that include dexamethasone be modi ﬁed when CPIs are
incorporated in antineoplastic treatment regimens?
METHODS
Guideline Update ProcessASCO uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline
updating.
6This approach identi ﬁes new, potentially
practice-changing data (signals) that might translate intorevised practice recommendations. The approach relies ontargeted literature searching and the expertise of ASCOguideline panel members to identify signals. For this up-date, observational studies of CPI ef ﬁcacy in patients
treated with corticosteroids
7,8and anecdotal reports of
provider concerns about this topic provided the primary
signals for an update.
This systematic review –based guideline update was de-
veloped by a multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included
a patient representative and an ASCO guidelines staff withhealth research methodology expertise. The Expert Panelmet via teleconference and/or webinar and correspondedthrough e-mail. Based upon the consideration of the evi-dence, the authors were asked to contribute to the de-velopment of the guideline, provide critical review, andﬁnalize the guideline recommendations. The guideline
recommendations were sent for an open comment period
of 2 weeks allowing the public to review and comment onthe recommendations after submitting a con ﬁdentiality
agreement. These comments were taken into considerationwhile ﬁnalizing the recommendations. Members of the
Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approvingthe penultimate version of guideline, which was thencirculated for external review, and submitted to the Journal
of Clinical Oncology (JCO) for editorial review and con-
sideration for publication. All ASCO guidelines are ulti-
mately reviewed and approved by the Expert Panel
(Appendix Table A1 , online only) and the ASCO Clinical
Practice Guidelines Committee prior to publication. All
funding for the administration of the project was provided
by ASCO.
The systematic review consisted of 2 parts:
1. An update of the literature search from the 2017
guideline.
5PubMed and the Cochrane Library were
searched from June 1, 2016, to January 24, 2020, for
English-language RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs.
RCTs were required to have at least 25 patientsper arm.
2. Identi ﬁcation of phase III RCTs that compared che-
motherapy alone with chemotherapy plus a CPI. We
searched PubMed for trials published through January24, 2020, with no restriction on start date. We col-
lected information about antiemetic regimens speci-
ﬁed by the protocol, exclusion criteria related to steroid
use, and the primary safety and ef ﬁcacy results of the
studies. The primary question was whether the ad-
dition of a CPI to chemotherapy improved ef ﬁcacy
even when dexamethasone-containing antiemeticregimens were used.
Search terms are provided in the Data Supplement. Articles
were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1)
meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-
reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters,
news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; and (3)published in a non-English language.
The Expert Panel also identi ﬁed new anticancer agents
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
since the 2017 update and evaluated their emetic potential
based on a nonsystematic review of RCTs, information
available in the product label, and informal consensus. Dueto the speci ﬁc interest in CPIs and dexamethasone, we notTHE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
Minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents
Pediatric patients treated with minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should not be offered routine antiemetic
prophylaxis (Type: informal consensus, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation:
strong).

ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients
should have the opportunity to participate.

only added new CPIs to the tables but also reassessed the
emetogenicity of CPIs that were addressed in the 2017guideline. Included CPIs were atezolizumab, avelumab,cemiplimab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, andpembrolizumab. Avelumab, cemiplimab, and durvalumabare new to this version of the guideline. Categories ofemetogenicity for intravenous agents were the same as inthe prior version of the guideline: high ( .90%), moderate
(30%-90%), low (10%-30%), and minimal ( ,10%).
5For
oral agents, we used only 2 categories of emetogenicity:minimal to low and moderate to high. This representsa change from the 2017 guideline and is consistent with theemetogenic schema used by the National ComprehensiveCancer Network (NCCN). This change is made given thegreater dif ﬁculty in classifying the emetogenicity of oral
agents given inconsistent reporting of emesis outcomes.A review of FDA oncology approvals was also conducted to
identify any new antiemetic agents or new formulations ofantiemetic agents.
The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using
the Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodol-
ogy and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software.
9In addition,
a guideline implementability review is conducted. Based onthe implementability review, revisions were made to thedraft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice.Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation,evidence, and potential bias are provided with eachrecommendation.
The ASCO Expert Panel and guidelines staff will work with co-
chairs to keep abreast of any substantive updates to theguideline. Based on formal review of the emerging literature,ASCO will determine the need to update. The ASCO
Guidelines Methodology Manual (available at www.asco.org/
guideline-methodology ) provides additional information
about the guideline update process. This is the most recentinformation as of the publication date.

NOTE. For patients who receive multiday chemotherapy, clinicians must ﬁrst determine the emetic risk of the agent(s) included in the regimen. Patients
should receive the agent of the highest therapeutic index daily during chemotherapy and for 2 days thereafter. Patients can also be offered the granis etron
transdermal patch or granisetron extended-release injection that delivers therapy over multiple days rather than taking a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist daily.
Abbreviations: 5-HT 3, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3; IV, intravenous; NK1, neurokinin 1.
aIf netupitant-palonosetron or fosnetupitant-palonosetron is used, no additional 5-HT 3receptor antagonist is needed.
bThe dexamethasone dose is for patients who are receiving the recommended 4-drug regimen for highly emetic chemotherapy. If patients do not receive an
NK1-receptor antagonist, the dexamethasone dose should be adjusted to 20 mg on day 1 and 16 mg on days 2-4.
cIn nonbreast cancer populations (eg, non-Hodgkin lymphoma) receiving a combination of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide with treatment
regimens incorporating corticosteroids, the addition of palonosetron without the use of an NK1-receptor antagonist and olanzapine is an option.
dIf the carboplatin area under the curve is $4 mg/mL/min, add an NK1-receptor antagonist to the 5-HT 3receptor antagonist and dexamethasone. If IV
aprepitant is used, 100 mg IV day 1 and then 80 mg oral days 2-3). Dexamethasone dosing is day 1 only: 20 mg with rolapitant; 12 mg with aprepitant,
fosaprepitant, or netupitant-palonosetron.
eFor moderate-emetic-risk agents with a known risk for delayed nausea and vomiting.
fPatients treated with low-emetic-risk antineoplastic therapy should be offered a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist OR dexamethasone.

Guideline and Con ﬂicts of Interest
The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with
ASCO ’s Con ﬂict of Interest Policy Implementation for
Clinical Practice Guidelines ( “Policy, ”found at http://
www.asco.org/rwc ). All members of the Expert Panel
completed ASCO ’s disclosure form, which requires dis-
closure of ﬁnancial and other interests, including re-
lationships with commercial entities that are reasonablylikely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impactas a result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories fordisclosure include employment; leadership; stock or otherownership; honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker ’s
bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other in-tellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommoda-
tions, expenses; and other relationships. In accordance
with the Policy, the majority of the members of the ExpertPanel did not disclose any relationships constitutinga con ﬂict under the Policy.
RESULTS
Antiemetic InterventionsA total of 77 publications were potentially eligible based on
abstract review (a list of publications is provided in the DataSupplement). Of these, 3 trials were selected for furtherreview by the Expert Panel: a 2019 trial of the NK1-receptorantagonist fosaprepitant in pediatric patients,
10a 2019 trial
of a 5-mg dose of olanzapine in adult patients treated withcisplatin-based chemotherapy,
11and a 2018 trial of
olanzapine in patients with hematologic malignancies who
received highly emetogenic chemotherapy and stem cell
transplantation.12
The phase III fosaprepitant trial evaluated the addition offosaprepitant to ondansetron plus dexamethasone in 163children ages 1-12 years who were receiving highly or mod-erately emetogenic chemotherapy.
10Children who received the
3-drug antiemetic regimen experienced lower rates of vomiting
than children who received only ondansetron plus dexa-
methasone. The primary outcome of delayed-phase completeresponse occurred in 79% of children in the intervention armand 51% of children in the intervention arm ( P,.001).
The phase III olanzapine trial evaluated the addition of 5 mg
of olanzapine to the combination of a 5HT-3 antagonist,dexamethasone, and an NK1-receptor antagonist. The trial
enrolled 710 adults who were scheduled to receivecisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients in the olanzapinearm demonstrated signi ﬁcant improvements in nausea and
vomiting prevention. The primary outcome of delayed-phase complete response occurred in 79% of patients in
the intervention arm and 66% of patients in the comparison
arm ( P,.0001). The 5-mg and 10-mg doses of olanzapine
have not been compared directly in this setting.
The addition of 10 mg of olanzapine to a 3-drug antiemetic
regimen (fosaprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone)was evaluated in a phase III trial among 101 patients withhematologic malignancies who received highly emetogenicchemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)regimens.
12Thirty-three of the patients received chemo-
therapy alone and 68 received conditioning chemotherapyfor HCT. Overall, the addition of olanzapine to the 3-drug
antiemetic regimen improved complete response com-
pared with the 3-drug regimen alone (55% v26%; P5
.003). A bene ﬁt of olanzapine was observed in the delayed
but not in the acute phase. In subgroup analysis, a bene ﬁt
was observed among patients receiving HCT (autologousonly) but not among the smaller group of patients treatedwith chemotherapy alone.
Addition of CPIs to Chemotherapy
Ten RCTs compared the combination of chemotherapy and
a CPI with chemotherapy alone.
13-22Two trials speci ﬁed
that a corticosteroid-containing antiemetic regimen shouldbe used.
13,17Each of these evaluated the addition of
pembrolizumab to chemotherapy for patients with meta-static non –small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In both trials,
the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improvedoverall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
Two trials of chemotherapy plus phased ipilimumab either
discouraged
18or prohibited14the use of steroids for antiemetic
purposes. The ﬁrst trial evaluated etoposide and a platinum
with or without ipilimumab in patients with extensive-stage
SCLC,18and the second trial evaluated paclitaxel and car-
boplatin with or without ipilimumab in patients with advancedsquamous NCLC.
14Ipilimumab did not improve OS in either
trial. In an earlier trial, in which the addition of ipilimumab todacarbazine improved OS among patients with untreatedmetastatic melanoma, the recommended antiemetic agentslisted in the protocol did not include dexamethasone.
19
Four trials of chemotherapy plus atezolizumab noted thatnausea and vomiting “should ”
20-22or“may”15be controlled
with adequate antiemetics, but researchers also cautioned
that systematic corticosteroids may attenuate the bene ﬁto f
atezolizumab. The addition of atezolizumab to chemo-therapy improved PFS but not OS in patients with triple-negative breast cancer,
20and improved both PFS and OS
in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC,21
extensive-stage SCLC,15and patients with stage IV non-
squamous NSCLC with no ALK orEGFR mutations.22TABLE 4. Emetic Risk in Adults by Site of Radiation Therapy

The addition of durvalumab to a platinum and etoposide
was evaluated among patients with extensive-stage SCLC.16
Premedication with steroids for chemotherapy was per-
mitted. In a planned interim analysis, the addition of
durvalumab to chemotherapy improved OS.
Emetogenicity
All CPIs were classi ﬁed as minimally emetogenic ( Table 1 ).
In the case of atezolizumab and ipilimumab, this representsa change from the 2017 guideline,
5in which each was
classi ﬁed as having low emetic risk. In trials published since
the 2017 guideline, the difference in risk of vomiting with
ipilimumab versus placebo was ,10%.23,24Similarly, the
addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy produced onlysmall increases in vomiting compared with chemotherapyalone.
15,20-22No RCTs were available for cemiplimab, and
emetogenicity was classi ﬁed as minimal based on the in-
formal consensus of the Expert Panel. Emetic risk in-formation was also added for 47 other new antineoplastic
agents ( Tables 1 and 2).
New Formulations of Antiemetic Agents
No new antiemetic agents were identi ﬁed. An intravenous
formulation of aprepitant that does not contain polysorbate80 (a solubilizing agent associated with hypersensitivityreactions) was approved by the FDA for the treatment ofchemotherapy-induced emesis in 2018. An intravenous
formulation of netupitant-palonosetron was also approved
by the FDA in 2018.RECOMMENDATIONS
There is no evidence from clinical trials in adults to warrant
omitting dexamethasone from guideline-compliant pro-phylactic antiemetic regimens when CPIs are administeredin combination with chemotherapy. CPIs administered
alone or in combination with another CPI are minimally
emetogenic in adults and do not require routine use ofa prophylactic antiemetic.
The full list of recommendations is provided in the Bottom
Line Box. Recommendations for adults are unchanged withthe exception of the option of adding olanzapine in thesetting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thischange was prompted by the trial by Clemmons et al.
12
Evidence for the remaining recommendations is discussedin the 2017 guideline,
5with no signals for change in the
updated literature search. Updated information regardingthe emetic risk of intravenous and oral antineoplasticagents in adults is provided in Tables 1 and 2.Table 3 ,
which lists antiemetic dosing information for adults byantineoplastic risk category, has been revised to include the5-mg dose of olanzapine
11as an option and to include the
intravenous formulations of aprepitant and netupitant-
palanosetron. Tables 4 and 5, which list emetic risk and
antiemetic dosing for adult patients treated with radiationtherapy, remain the same as in the 2017 guideline.
Recommendations for children have been updated to
add fosaprepitant as an NK1-receptor antagonist optionfor children who receive highly or moderately emetogenicTABLE 5. Antiemetic Administration in Adults by Radiation Therapy Risk Category (continued)

aEither 5-HT 3receptor antagonist is appropriate.
bRadiation therapy involving (at least in part) the anatomic region from the superior border of the 11th thoracic vertebra to the inferior border of the third

cOndansetron or granisetron preferred because of the larger body of evidence for these agents.
dMonitor patients during radiation therapy schedules spanning multiple weeks to detect symptoms experienced during interspersed days when radiati on
therapy and prophylaxis are not administered (eg, weekends) and to balance bene ﬁts and toxicities of prolonged 5-HT 3receptor antagonist therapy.
eCorticosteroid is the preferred ﬁrst agent for the brain. Any antiemetic class is appropriate for head and neck, thorax, and pelvis.
fEither 5-HT 3receptor antagonist is appropriate.
gDepending on the severity of symptoms and the remaining duration of radiation therapy, patients can receive subsequent breakthrough therapy as
needed or begin receiving prophylactic therapy for the remainder of radiation therapy.
hEither dopamine-receptor antagonist is appropriate. Metoclopramide is a dual dopamine/5-HT 3receptor antagonist.
iEither 5-HT 3receptor antagonist is appropriate.
jPatients can receive breakthrough therapy as needed. Alternative explanations for symptoms should be investigated to avoid the need for prophylact ic
therapy for the remainder of radiation therapy.

chemotherapy. This is based on the trial by Radhak-
rishnan et al10and the addition of pediatric patients to US
prescribing informati on for fosaprepitant.25Other rec-
ommendations for pediatric patients remain unchanged.The evidence for these recommendations is discussedin the 2017 guideline,
5with no signals for change in
the updated literature search. Pediatric patients were
not included in the statement regarding dexamethasoneand CPIs due to a lack of direct evidence in thispopulation.
DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) have
been consistently demonstrated to be among the most
feared adverse effects of cancer treatment.
26,27Signi ﬁcant
progress has been made in limiting CINV through the in-troduction of several classes of antiemetics and theirevidence-based incorporation into antiemetic regimens.
28
Corticosteroids —almost exclusively dexamethasone —
have been shown to be effective and safe agents for useeither as single agents with low emetogenic chemotherapy
or as essential components of multiagent, combination
antiemetic regimens with moderate and highly emetogenicchemotherapy.
29
CPIs have recently become an integral component of an-tineoplastic treatment in a variety of settings.
30-32Some
theoretical concerns have been expressed that concurrentcorticosteroid use might potentially compromise the anti-
neoplastic ef ﬁcacy of CPIs.
33,34No de ﬁnitive data are
currently available to prove or disprove this hypothesis.Small retrospective series have suggested inferior survivaloutcomes in patients receiving concurrent corticosteroid($10 mg of prednisone equivalent daily) used as largely
palliative therapy for various conditions (eg, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease, anorexia —not as antiemetics)
and CPIs administered as monotherapy.
7,8,35These 3 series
are small and have inadequate information on corticoste-
roid dose, duration, and indication for use. In 1 series,patients receiving corticosteroids for nonpalliative in-dications had comparable survival as patients not receivingcorticosteroids.
8A systematic review of the literature was
reported in 2017 assessing clinical outcomes of patientswith cancer treated with CPIs and concomitant cortico-steroids.
36No clear evidence of a poorer clinical outcome
was noted in the reviewed populations.
The 2017 ASCO Antiemetic Guideline update5listed both
atezolizumab and ipilimumab in the low-emetic-risk cate-gory. Based upon available updated data, the guidelinepanel recommends that these agents and all other ap-proved anti –PD-1, anti –PD-L1, and the anti –CTLA-4 agent
ipilimumab now be listed as minimally emetogenic. The
current NCCN guidelines also categorize all available CPIs
as minimally emetogenic.
37Therefore, no routine anti-
emetic prophylaxis is indicated when these agents are usedas monotherapy or combined with another CPI in the ab-
sence of chemotherapy.
A number of phase III trials in NSCLC,13,14,17SCLC,15,16and
breast cancer20have demonstrated superior PFS, OS, or
both when a CPI is combined with chemotherapy compared
with chemotherapy alone. A variety of different prophylactic
antiemetic regimens were used in these studies. With regardto corticosteroid use as a component of antiemetic pro-phylaxis, some trials either prohibited
14or actively discour-
aged18corticosteroid use. Other trials15,16,20allowed but did
not speci ﬁcally recommend corticosteroid use. Two trials in
NSCLC, however, speci ﬁed a guideline-compliant antiemetic
regimen that included a corticosteroid.13,17KEYNOTE 189
and KEYNOTE 407 evaluated the role of platinum-based
chemotherapy used alone or in combination with the anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab in patients with metastaticnonsquamous and squamous NSCLC, respectively. Thecombination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor an-tagonist, dexamethasone (or equivalent), and the NK1-receptor antagonist aprepitant were recommended as theantiemetic regimen to use prior to chemotherapy adminis-
tration. PFS and OS in these 2 trials were signi ﬁcantly su-
perior in the arms containing pembrolizumab. Thus, thepanel has concluded there is no clinical evidence to warrantdeleting dexamethasone from guideline-compliant pro-phylactic antiemetic regimens when CPIs are administeredin combination with chemotherapy.
No new antiemetic agents have been introduced since
the 2017 antiemetic update. Intravenous formulations of
aprepitant and netupitant-palonosetron were approved bythe FDA for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesisin 2018, and a 5-mg dose of olanzapine has been shownto be safe and effective when used in combination witha 5-HT
3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and an NK1-
receptor antagonist with highly emetogenic chemotherapy.Olanzapine also showed promising ef ﬁcacy in the setting
of high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplanta-
tion,
12and is an option to be added to the combination of
a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, an NK1 receptor antagonist,
and dexamethasone. Finally, this update has categorizedthe emetogenic potential of the new antineoplastic agentsFDA approved since the 2017 update.

GUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION
ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across
health settings. Each ASCO guideline includes a memberfrom ASCO ’s Practice Guideline Implementation Network
(PGIN) on the panel. The additional role of this PGINrepresentative on the guideline panel is to assess thesuitability of the recommendations to implementation in thecommunity setting and also to identify any other barrier toimplementation a reader should be aware of. Barriers to
implementation include the need to increase awareness of
the guideline recommendations among front-line practi-tioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also toprovide adequate services in the face of limited resources.The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitateimplementation of recommendations. This guideline willbe distributed widely through the ASCO PGIN. ASCOguidelines are posted on the ASCO web site and most often
published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and the JCO
Oncology Practice .ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform
medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that allpatients should have the opportunity to participate.
