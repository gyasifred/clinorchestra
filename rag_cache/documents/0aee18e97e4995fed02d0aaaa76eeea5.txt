NOMENCLATURE AND DESCRIPTION FOR RATING GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS
Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 orLevel 2, and the certainty of the supporting
evidence is shown as A,B,C,o rD.
GradeImplications
Patients Clinicians Policy
Level 1
“We recommend”Most people in your situation wouldwant the recommended course ofaction, and only a small proportion
would not.Most patients should receive the
recommended course of action.The recommendation can be evaluatedas a candidate for developing a policyor a performance measure.
Level 2
“We suggest ”The majority of people in your situationwould want the recommended course
of action, but many would not.Different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. Each patient needs
help to arrive at a managementdecision consistent with their valuesand preferences.The recommendation is likely to require
substantial debate and involvement of
stakeholders before policy can bedetermined.
Grade Certainty of evidence Meaning
A High We are con ﬁdent that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect.
B Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
C Low The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
D Very low The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect.
Practice points are consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded. They are issued when a
clinical question did not have a systematic review performed, to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendation (e.g., frequency
of monitoring, provision of standard care [such as regular clinic visits], referral to specialist care, etc.), or for issuing “good practice statements ”when
the alternative is considered to be absurd. Users should consider the practice point as expert guidance and use it as they see ﬁt to inform the care of
patients. Although these statements are developed based on a different methodology, they should not be seen as “less important ”or a “downgrade ”
from graded recommendations.www.kidney-international.org reference keys

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
organization was established in 2003 with the mission toimprove the care and outcomes of people living with kidneydisease worldwide. The development and implementation ofglobal clinical practice guidelines is central to the many ac-
tivities of KDIGO to ful ﬁll its mission. Twenty years later, we
are excited to present this update of the KDIGO Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to complement the existing
12 guidelines that address various other facets of kidneydisease management.
Our aspiration is that the KDIGO CKD Guideline serves as
a comprehensive reference for evidence-based practices, of-
fering clear and valuable guidance for the optimal diagnosis
and treatment of CKD. The updated guideline is the result ofa rigorous process, extensively detailed in the KDIGOMethods Manual. To promote objectivity and transparency,we screen Guideline Co-Chairs and Work Group members(which include clinicians, researchers, and patients) for con-ﬂicts of interest. Over a span of 2 –3 years, these individuals
volunteer their time, starting with the creation of a Scope of
Work that undergoes an open public review to engage all
stakeholders. This document is then adapted into a Requestfor Proposal, which is used to enlist an independent EvidenceReview Team.
The Evidence Review Team conducts a systematic review of
existing literature, extracting studies with appropriate designand outcomes deemed important by both people with CKDand clinicians. All work is meticulously graded on study
quality and potential bias, forming the basis for quantifying
the overall certainty of the evidence using the “Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalua-tion”(GRADE) approach. The penultimate version of the
guideline also undergoes public review to capture additionalperspectives. Thus, guidelines are the result of a rigorous andobjective assessment of available evidence, enriched by thecollective expertise of healthcare providers, researchers, and
patients alike. Guideline statements (“We recommend ”or
“We suggest ”)r eﬂect clinical questions that were addressed bythe evidence reviews from the Evidence Review Team. Practice
points provide guidance on clinical questions that were not,and largely could not be, studied by the Evidence ReviewTeam.
We view the current guideline as a dynamic, evolving
resource rather than a static document. We are delighted by therecent pace of clinical discovery that substantially increased thescienti ﬁc basis of optimal CKD diagnosis and management,
and we remain committed to updating recommendations andpractice points as important evidence emerges. We hope thatthe guideline will serve as a useful tool for clinicians in theirdaily practice, providing clear insight into the evidence-basedrecommendations while highlighting areas requiring further
research. Ultimately, our aim is to facilitate more effective and
consistent care to patients with CKD worldwide, and thepublication of the CKD Guideline will provide the foundationof many dissemination and implementation activities to in-crease the outreach and usefulness of this work.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude for all those who have
contributed to the CKD Guideline. First, to the members ofthe Methods Committee, particularly Dr. Marcello Tonelli,
MD, SM, MSc, Chair of the Committee, and Amy Earley, BS,
KDIGO Guideline Development Director, for setting theexpectation of rigor, balance, and transparency throughoutthe process. Next, to the Evidence Review Team at JohnsHopkins University, for their meticulous work in reviewingthe existing literature. Third, to the Work Group members,led by the indefatigable Drs. Adeera Levin, MD, and PaulStevens, MB, for their diligence and innumerable hours vol-
unteered to shepherd the guideline to publication. Fourth, to
the many individuals who provided comments during therounds of public review. Finally, to the whole KDIGO staff,for their steadfast, behind the scenes commitment to excel-lence in patient care.

Abstract
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for
the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an update to the KDIGO
2012 guideline on the topic. The aim is to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, bothadults and children. People receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are not the focus ofthis guideline. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation of CKD, risk assessment inpeople with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and manage its complications, medicalmanagement and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. In addition, this
guideline includes a comprehensive introduction from the guideline Co-Chairs, a patient
foreword, a discussion of special population considerations, a presentation of the relative andabsolute risks associated with speci ﬁc outcomes from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-
PC), and an extensive section dedicated to research recommendations based on the current gapsin evidence. The goal of the guideline is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients byproviding actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review, practicepoints that serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not con-ducted, and useful infographics. The guideline targets a broad audience of healthcare providers
involved in the care of people with CKD as well as people with CKD themselves while being
mindful of implications for policy and payment. Development of this guideline update followedan explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline rec-ommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the certaintyof the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the “Grading of Recommenda-
tions Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ”(GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evi-
dence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.

Patient foreword
The identi ﬁcation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) begins a
long journey for any patient that will have a direct impact on
their lifestyle and future health outcomes. This guidelineidenti ﬁes the suitability of medical interventions that can
improve or delay the seriousness of CKD and possible kidneyfailure.
In a complicated world of health provision, having a set of
evidential recommendations and practice points provideskidney service providers with the targets for a quality CKDservice for people with kidney disease. However, if the startingpoint for many people is ignorance of what a kidney actuallydoes, then without a holistic approach to patient care, much ofthe potential effectiveness of medical interventions can bediluted because of patient circumstances and psychologicalchallenges.
Acceptance of the seriousness of CKD can take a lot
longer for a person to process, to the possible detriment ofmedical intervention, and may well lead to issues over
adherence.
A controlled, managed CKD decline is so bene ﬁcial to
patients who have so many social issues to contend with, be it
diet, tiredness, liquid control, pill overload, and a deep diveinto the very mechanics of how we eat and drink to surviveand excrete excesses.
In an ever-increasingly busy world of medical care, as pa-
tients, we believe that the best approach is for any physician to
aim to achieve a partnership of knowledge with the patient
regarding their CKD care. This will build patient con ﬁdence and
self-awareness, with the aim that any patient who sadly arrives atpossible dialysis is in the right state of mind, which is critical for aconsidered approach to the next stage of a patient ’s journey.

Introduction, qualifying statements, and key concepts
This 2024 update of the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline
for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-ease (CKD)
1is an evidence-based guideline that provides
recommendations and practice points for clinicalmanagement activities.
The past 10 years have provided new hope for improved
treatment of CKD. A greater understanding of healthy lifestyleand lifestyle modi ﬁcations together with new medications
and technologies furnish improved options for treatment andmonitoring of CKD. People with CKD, healthcare providers,and health systems are eager to implement these advances in
the most effective and evidence-based manner. This requires
integration of new therapies with lifestyle management andexisting medications using approaches that engage patientsand optimize application of health resources. The goal of thisguideline document is to provide such guidance. The majorityof statements from the 2012 guideline have been updatedbased on current knowledge and practice. Only 6 statementswere retained in their original form in 2012.
As Co-Chairs, we would like to recognize the outstanding
efforts of the Work Group, the Evidence Review Team (ERT),and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)staff. The Work Group was diverse, multinational, multidis-ciplinary, experienced, thoughtful, and dedicated. Notably,the Work Group included 2 members who have CKD whocontributed actively as peers to keep the guideline relevantand patient-centered. We are indebted to each and every in-
dividual who contributed to this process. We hope that the
guidance provided here will help improve the care of peoplewith CKD worldwide.
The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was built on the United
States (US)-based Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative(KDOQI) 2002 Guideline on De ﬁnition, Classi ﬁcation, and
Evaluation of CKD,
2accepted by the international
community in 2005. It reinforced the de ﬁnition of CKD
incorporating a persistent reduction in glomerular ﬁltration
rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage and modi ﬁed the
staging and classi ﬁcation system to include elements that
had begun to be appreciated by the clinical community.3
Speci ﬁcally, the 2012 guideline introduced the concept of a
“CGA”classi ﬁcation of CKD based on cause (C), level of
kidney function determined by GFR (G), and degree ofalbuminuria (A). The CGA classi ﬁcation laid a foundation
upon which management, treatment, research, and riskassessment of CKD have since been based.
The de ﬁnition, staging, and classi ﬁcation of CKD pro-
posed by the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline have been widelyaccepted and implemented worldwide. Research has sincehighlighted that higher speci ﬁc stages or categories of CKD,
characterized by level of GFR and albuminuria independently,portend greater relative risk (RR) for adverse outcomes.
4–7
These include, but are not limited to, CKD progression,cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality (all-cause and car-diovascular), kidney failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI).The development of risk-prediction tools has re ﬁned moni-
toring and referral to specialist nephrology and has aided inthe estimation of prognosis.
6,8–10Although there remains
ongoing discussion about application of the same thresholdsto de ﬁne disease in older adults,
11it is still clear that even
in older populations, risk of adverse outcomes increaseswith higher CKD stages (Figure 1 ).
12In any ﬁeld of
medicine, although data from large population studiesinform clinical practice guidelines and associated
recommendations for care, it is critically important to
consider the individual in front of you, their preferences,and their individual risks and bene ﬁts. We recognize that
the threshold GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2(GFR
categories G3a –G5) for >3 months to indicate a diagnosis
of CKD is well below the average in young adult men andwomen,
13but because a signi ﬁcant GFR reduction in
younger people is also usually associated with other markers
of kidney disease, the diagnosis of CKD would be captured.
Similarly, we recognize that there is an average age-associated GFR decline observed in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies,
14but with substantial variation among
individuals within the population,15such that not all
individuals will have a signi ﬁcant GFR decline with age.12
This guideline is not intended to be a textbook, and thus
statements regarding prevention and screening for CKD,
although important topics, are not addressed in depth but are
brieﬂy discussed below in the context of the global burden of
CKD and in Chapter 1. For a more detailed discussion of theseissues, we refer readers to existing textbooks and reviews.
16–18
Prevention and screening for CKD should be conductedmostly by healthcare providers in primary care and in otherspecialties, such as endocrinology, cardiology, and oncology,rather than restricted to nephrologists. We strongly support
efforts aimed at the early detection and treatment of CKD
among people at high risk for CKD, including those withhypertension, diabetes, and CVD. Screening efforts in theseand other populations should include assessments of GFR(estimated or in certain situations measured [see Section 1.2]
and albuminuria [or surrogate, see Section 1.3]).
The intended starting point for this update of the KDIGO
2012 CKD guideline is an established diagnosis of CKD,
though there are some practice points to clarify the evaluation
of CKD and the ascertainment of chronicity. The care ofpeople with CKD is multifaceted and complex. Several criticalaspects of this comprehensive care, such as blood pressure(BP), diabetes, and lipid management, have been addressed inother KDIGO guidelines. These topics were not reviewed forthe current guideline, but recommendations have beenincorporated where relevant and we refer readers to those
speciﬁc KDIGO guidelines and their updates.

Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S135
This clinical practice guideline includes 2 different types of
statements: graded recommendations, which are supported by
systematic reviews (i.e., de novo reviews conducted by the in-
dependent ERTor existing high-quality reviews that have beensystematically identi ﬁed), and ungraded practice points, which
serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematicreview was not conducted for various reasons (e.g., lack of asufﬁcient evidence base or randomized controlled trials
[RCTs] would be impractical/unethical). Both recommenda-tions and practice points are intended to help guide clinicalpractice and aid in decision-making; thus, they collectively arethe guidance statements. They are clearly articulated andpresented together so that all guideline statements can be
implemented. The distinction between them is based on the
process by which they are derived, that process is based on theframework methodology from the KDIGO Methods Com-mittee and aligns with other international guideline groupsutilizing the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation ”(GRADE) methodology.
Several exciting developments have been introduced into
clinical practice since the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline waspublished. These include re ﬁnement of evaluation of GFR,
population and individual risk prediction, and novel treat-ments which have all positively in ﬂuenced the prognosis for
people with CKD. The Work Group has aimed to generate aguideline that is both rigorously devoted to new and existing
evidence, and clinically useful.
Research recommendations are presented in a separate
section at the end of this document and are intended to guide
the next set of important research questions to inform andimprove outcomes of people living with CKD. The researchrecommendations are not exhaustive but are intended to helpfocus the clinical and research communities on unansweredquestions including improving diagnostic tools and evalua-
tion of kidney function, development and testing of risk
prediction equations in clinical and research settings, evalu-ation of different therapies to delay progression in variouscombinations, improved medication management, andoptimal models of care. We speci ﬁcally urge the community
to be inclusive of people across the lifecycle and include sexand gender, and etiology of CKD, as important variables in allstudies.Age <65

Deﬁnition and classi ﬁcation of CKD
Deﬁning CKD. CKD is de ﬁned as abnormalities of kidney
structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months,
with implications for health ( Table 1 ).1
Classifying CKD. CKD is classi ﬁed based on Cause, GFR
category (G1 –G5), and Albuminuria category (A1 –A3),
abbreviated as CGA .1These 3 components of the
classi ﬁcation system are each critical in the assessment of
people with CKD and help enable determination of severityand risk. Listed below are reference tables describing eachcomponent. Note that while the de ﬁnition of CKD includes
many different markers of kidney damage and is notconﬁned to decreased GFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) >30 mg/g [> 3 mg/mmol], the classi ﬁcation system
is based on the 2 dimensions of GFR and degree of
albuminuria ( Tables 2 and 3). This nuance is often missed
by healthcare providers and students.
It is well established that patient advocates with CKD and
healthcare providers prefer the more clinically useful and
generally understood assessment of GFR resulting from theuse of GFR estimating equations compared with serumcreatinine (SCr) alone. Globally, although still not universallyavailable in all countries, SCr is measured routinely and the
approach to assessment of GFR is therefore to use SCr and an
estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. Theapproach to evaluation of GFR using initial and supportivetests is described in greater detail in Chapter 1.
Etiology of CKD should be sought, and there are
numerous systems for grouping various etiologies, some ofwhich are evolving with new knowledge and diagnostic tools.There are congenital and genetic causes of CKD, some asso-
ciated with systemic diseases, and others that are primary. It is
beyond our remit to suggest a speci ﬁc approach, but we
highlight the importance of establishing a cause to individ-ualize management of CKD.
The global burden of CKD
The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk FactorsStudy (GBD) pulls together data on premature death anddisability from more than 350 diseases and injuries in 204
countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present.
24Disease
“burden ”is the impact of a health problem as measured byﬁnancial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators and
can be measured by combining 2 indicators to describe thedisability-adjusted life-years (DALYs): the number of yearsof life lost to disease and the number of years lived withdisability due to disease.
Globally, in 2017, a systematic analysis from the all-age
GBD project found 697.5 million (95% uncertainty interval[UI]: 649.2 –752.0) cases of all-stage CKD, for a global preva-
lence of 9.1% (8.5% –9.8%).
25By 2021, a joint statement from
the American Society of Nephrology, European RenalAssociation, and International Society of Nephrologyindicated that more than 850 million people suffer fromsome form of kidney disease, roughly double the number ofpeople who live with diabetes (422 million) and 20 times
more than the prevalence of cancer worldwide (42 million)
or people living with AIDS/HIV (36.7 million). Theseestimates derive from aggregation of studies worldwide,which have applied a variety of de ﬁnitions of CKD;
nevertheless, they furnish the best guide about global CKDprevalence.
In 2017, CKD was estimated to account for 35.8 million
(95% UI: 33.7 e38.0) DALYs, and 1.2 million people died
from CKD. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated inthe 3 lowest quintiles of sociodemographic index (SDI). In2019, CKD was responsible for 41.5 million (95% UI: 38.3 –
45.0) DALYs, and 1.43 million people died from CKD.
24Age-
standardized DALY rates (Figure 224) were highest in central
and Andean Latin America, at 1348.1 (1203.6 –1521.6) and
836.3 (704.2 –981.6) per 100,000, respectively (global rate
was 514.9 [474.9 –558.9]). In 2017, CKD in diabetes
represented a third of all DALYs, and there were 1.4 millionTable 1 | Criteria for chronic kidney disease (either of the

(95% UI: 1.2 –1.6) CVD-related deaths in people with CKD;
25.3 (22.2 –28.9) million CVD DALYs were attributable to
impaired kidney function. Overall, CKD and its effect on
CVD resulted in 2.6 million (95% UI: 2.4 –2.8) deaths in
2017 and CKD has risen from 19th to 11th in rank amongleading causes of death between 1990 and 2019 due toaging and an increasing burden of risk factors for CKD(including diabetes and hypertension) that, together,contribute to more than half of the deaths from CKD.
Screening and prevention
Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD,there remains controversy and lack of consensus as to the
utility of population screening for CKD
26or targeted
screening programs,18due to the complexity of the
underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public
health policy has a role to play in identifying andaddressing risk factors to prevent CKD, to identify CKDearly, and to delay its progression and associated adverseoutcomes. Education of both health personnel and thepopulations at risk, implementation of early kidney disease
detection programs, and incorporation of evidence-based
treatment of CKD and its associated conditions, such as BPand diabetes, are all essential components of a strategy toaddress this burden. A systematic review suggested thatscreening for CKD is cost- effective in people with diabetes
and hypertension, the 2 most common causes of CKDworldwide.
16However, clinical trials have not been
conducted to determine whether or not an intervention to
detect, risk -stratify, and treat CKD would improve the
health outcomes for the targeted population. Nevertheless,
cost-effective analysis of population -wide screening for CKD
incorporating evidence -based treatment with sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) recently
concluded that screening adults for albuminuria to identifyCKD could be cost -effective in the United States.
27
This evidence aligns with the KDIGO Controversies Con-
ference on Early Detection and Intervention in CKD, whichconcluded that early identi ﬁcation of CKD in people at risk,
who are usually asymptomatic, would likely be bene ﬁcial in the
community and primary care settings if the programs areinterwoven with risk strati ﬁcation and treatment.
17A
community program must be able to provide treatment tothe high-risk group of patients with newly detected CKD tojustify systematic early detection strategies. An additionalconclusion was that screening and treatment programs forCKD should be implemented based on risk strati ﬁcation to
prioritize people, particularly in settings with limitedeconomic resources. Although globally people withhypertension, diabetes, or CVD are at high risk for CKD,
other high-risk people may be identi ﬁed through genetic risk
factors or by varying exposure to environmental pollution,
pesticides, water, and nephrotoxic medications includingsigniﬁcant analgesic use and herbal medications, depending
on geographical region. Frameworks in which to considerspeciﬁc regional factors have been offered to facilitate
discussion about the value and context of screening for CKD.
26
Currently, kidney disease awareness remains low, and
worldwide only 6% of the general population and 10% of thehigh-risk population are aware of their CKD status. Impor-tant to note is that patient advocates with CKD strongly arguefor earlier CKD screening and diagnosis.
17They also advocate
for CKD detection to be integrated with patient and familyeducation and engagement to improve accessing appropriatehealthcare and knowledge and adherence to recommendedlifestyle modi ﬁcation and medications.

Use of a simple algorithm such as that shown above in
settings such as primary care, cardiology, and endocrinology
could signi ﬁcantly improve the early identi ﬁcation and
treatment of CKD (Figure 3 ).28
There are no current evidence-based recommendations
regarding the frequency of screening in people at risk of CKD.In the setting of diabetes, a consensus report from the Amer-ican Diabetes Association (ADA) and KDIGO recommendsannual screening of people with diabetes for CKD.
29CKD
screening should start at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D)because evidence of CKD is often already apparent at thistime. For type 1 diabetes (T1D), screening is recommended
commencing 5 years after diagnosis. The overall costs of a
screening program are largely driven by the frequency ofrepeat screening, so the timing of repeated testing should beguided by CKD risk. There are risk equations available toestimate the interval risk of developing CKD, and this riskstratiﬁcation could guide repeat testing intervals.
30International considerations
In low- and middle-income regions of the world and in thelower sociodemographic quintiles, there is a large gap betweenCKD burden and provision of adequate healthcare. There islimited access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) combinedwith the rising prevalence of diabetes and hypertension andevidence of substantial sex and gender disparities in access to
CKD treatment. These factors highlight the importance of early
identi ﬁcation and treatment of risk factors in primary care.
However, the majority of the world ’s population with CKD is
in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where there aredisparities in access to laboratory diagnostic services, kidneybiopsy, and imaging services, in availability of appropriatelyskilled healthcare providers and the availability and afford-ability of medications. The International Society of Nephrology
survey assessing global kidney healthcare resources reported
that fewer than 1 in 4 surveyed countries had facilities availablefor routine measurements of SCr or proteinuria.

albuminuria may also be used to diagnose CKD, but albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and GFR are still required to determine stage and
estimate risk of progression. Acute kidney disease (AKD) is de ﬁned by the abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications
for health and with a duration of #3 months.28The orange boxes indicate actions in people at risk for CKD and in whom testing should be

Importantly, slowing CKD progression at early stages
should provide economic bene ﬁts and prevent the develop-
ment of kidney failure and cardiovascular complications. A
systematic review of care models in LMIC found that those
supporting primary care providers or allied health workers
achieved effectiveness in slowing GFR decline, as opposed tointerventions centered on specialty care alone.
32Where there
are resource limitations, it is logical to deploy resources wherethey will be most cost-effective, for example, to higher-risk,preventable stages.
Standardization/accuracy of testing tools including
assays/equipment
The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline built on recommendations
made to clinical laboratories in the earlier KDOQI 2002guidance. Clinical laboratories were speci ﬁcally charged with
measuring SCr and serum cystatin C using assays with cali-bration traceable to the international standard referencematerials recommending that, for SCr, there should be
minimal bias compared with isotope-dilution mass spec-
trometry.
1Recommendations were also made with respect to
measurement and reporting of albumin and protein in theurine. Although some of the recommendations havebecome part of routine practice, the effective use of clinicalguidelines and therefore effective patient care, includingaccurate diagnosis and referral prioritization, clinicalresearch, and public health prioritization, require
comparability of laboratory results independent of time,
place, and measurement procedure. Key to this isestablishing precision and between-laboratory agreementwith traceability to accepted reference standards whereveravailable. Therefore, this guidance document includesstandards for laboratory tests. The InternationalConsortium for Harmonization of Clinical LaboratoryResults (ICHLR) was established to create a pathway for
harmonization and aid implementation of clinical guidelines
recommending the use of laboratory tests in the diagnosisand management of disease,
33ensuring that both reference
materials and test methodology are harmonized. TheICHLR aimed to prioritize measurands by medicalimportance and both coordinate and stimulate developmentof technical and regulatory processes to achieveharmonization of those measurands.
34Although this has
been achieved for SCr, the current status of other keymeasurands such as cystatin C and urinary albumin is notyet suf ﬁciently clear.
The foundations for this 2024 guideline have been devel-
oped over the last 20 years, galvanizing the collaborative workof researchers, healthcare providers, laboratory physicians,patients, and carers. The current updated guideline documentreinforces methods for accurate diagnosis of CKD and pre-
diction, incorporates novel treatment strategies and ap-
proaches to managing people living with CKD, and identi ﬁes
further areas for research. Importantly, as the ﬁeld is rapidly
changing, we commit to updating relevant sections of thisdocument as new evidence becomes available, to ensure moretimely updates than have previously been possible.

Special considerations
The Work Group recognizes that kidney diseases affect people
at different times and with different impacts across the wholelifespan. Thus, enabling a personalized approach, consideringage, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and
treatment is critical. At the extremes of age —the very young
and the very old— diagnostic procedures, treatment aims,
treatment modalities, and decision-making differ due to dif-
ferences in prognosis, treatment options, and prioritization.In young and middle-aged adults, treatment approaches maydiffer due to speci ﬁc circumstances, such as pregnancy or
menopause. Sex (biological attributes) and gender (socio-cultural factors), as well as other important intersectional
factors including but not limited to geographical location,
socioeconomic status (SES), and race and ethnicity, playimportant roles in kidney health and disease.
Here we introduce concepts as to why age, sex, and gender
should be considered in the context of diagnosis, treatment,and care planning in people with CKD. In addition, thespeciﬁc guideline chapters incorporate statements where
special considerations regarding age, sex, and gender are
relevant to clinical practice and understanding.
Considerations in children and adolescents
When the guideline refers to people with CKD, this includes
children (people <10 years old) and adolescents (people10–19 years old). When there are altered care recommenda-
tions and practice points due to the unique needs of childrenor the lack of data to inform recommendations and practicepoints, these considerations are discussed within the Pediatric
considerations sections of the guideline.
The management of children and adolescents with CKD
needs special consideration ( Figure 4 ). Children and adults have
different etiologies of CKD. Up to 40% –50% of childhood CKD
is due to congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract(CAKUT); the younger the CKD population, the greater theproportion with CAKUT as the cause.
35,36CAKUT is
characterized by slower progression to kidney failure and a
higher likelihood of polyuria than the conditions causing CKD
in adults. Pediatric CKD has several unique aspects:
Delivery of care. Pediatric healthcare providers engage with
not only the person with CKD but also their carers and sib-lings. Age-appropriate care and education, understood byboth the child and their carers, is necessary. Holistic consid-eration of the needs and capabilities of the family unit isimportant in ensuring effective CKD care. Engagement with
patients and families must change over the course of child-
hood from being entirely carer-directed for infants, changingto include the whole family unit in childhood, and thenleaning toward the young person to ensure successful tran-sition to adult-oriented care.

Growth, puberty, and young adulthood. Childhood and
adolescence are characterized by physical growth and devel-
opment. All CKD care aims to optimize these physiologicalprocesses, which are commonly disrupted by CKD. Puberty isa time of rapid somatic growth with an increase in musclebulk and therefore constitutes a high-risk period for CKDprogression as compromised kidneys may not hypertrophy to
adapt to the larger body size. Adolescence and emerging
adulthood bring individuation and exploration of sexualityand adult behaviors, and kidney disease care must recognizeand adapt to these changes.
Kidney development and long-term assessment of kidney
risks. Although nephron formation is complete by 36 weeks of
gestation, kidney function continues to develop throughoutearly childhood, with nephron growth and maturation pro-
gressing particularly rapidly in the ﬁrst year of life. An actual
increase in GFR over the course of the ﬁrst 1 –2 years of life, and
even up to 4 years of age, is expected. A trajectory of increasing
GFR in infancy and very early childhood followed by a period ofrelative stability and a subsequent progression in CKD inadolescence or adulthood is common. Given the long life ex-pectancy of children, follow-up plans must take into accountthe risk of late CKD or kidney failure. Healthy children and
adolescents should have excellent kidney function, so an esti-
mated eGFR under 90 ml/min per 1.73 m
2(CKD G2 –G5)
represents decreased kidney function in these age groups. Earlyassessment and intervention of children with CKD is crucial tomaximize overall health across the lifespan.
Neurodevelopment and education. A primary goal of pedi-
atric CKD care is to optimize neurodevelopmental gains.CKD can affect development, cognition, school attendance,
vocational outcomes, and future employment. Mitigating
these de ﬁcits through effective, individualized care is essential
to give children with CKD the best possible future.
Considerations in older adults
Older adults constitute a substantial and steadily growingproportion of people under nephrology and medical careglobally, especially in Western industrialized countries.Longevity in many parts of the world is increasing, and thusthe prevalence of CKD in those people is also increasing. The2022 US Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data reporthighlights that the number of individuals initiating KRT iscontinuously ascending with increasing age. In Taiwan, for
example, KRT incidence in those aged 75 þwas 2858 per
million population (pmp) compared with 1583 pmp among
people aged 65 –74 years, 530 pmp among people aged 45 –64
years, and 97 pmp among people aged 20 –44 years. The
pattern is very similar across the globe with the majority ofpeople initiating dialysis over the age of 75, which putsemphasis on a group of people who are not just old, but veryold, and incorporates more and more people over the age of
80. Octo- and nonagenarians often demonstrate distinct
patterns of disease complexity. These features include multi-morbidity often accompanied by polypharmacy, frailty,cognitive impairment, and gerontopsychiatric disordersamong others. Often, several of these features coexist espe-cially in older adults with CKD.
Implications for aging adults with CKD are important in
both diagnosis and treatment. The interpretation of labora-
tory results (speci ﬁcally SCr) used in the staging system
should factor in an older adult ’s habitus given the frequency
of sarcopenia. A creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) will over-
estimate GFR in the elderly (and others) with sarcopenialeading to drug overdosing. Urine ACR at the same time willbe falsely high due to the falsely low creatinine in the de-nominator. Furthermore, the presence of frailty may altertreatment targets recommended for younger people with
CKD, as they may not necessarily be transferable to older
adults. Strict BP-lowering, for example, may come with therisk of dizziness, falls, and fractures in older adults, many ofwhom are on anticoagulants risking severe hemorrhage.
The multidimensionality of comorbidities in old age poses
challenges, as it demands a sophisticated integrated andcomplex multidisciplinary care and treatment approach,which may not be available in every healthcare system. Life
expectancy in old age is naturally limited compared with
younger people. Perspectives and treatment goals shift overthe life course, and recognizing these in very old adults, asdifferent from those in middle-aged or younger adults withCKD, is critical to the development of more personalized careplans and goals. Speci ﬁcally, pure survival may become less of
a priority for an older individual, whereas maintaining anacceptable, good quality of life (QoL) may be more impor-
tant. The context of a person ’s situation and own values and
preferences may modify the prioritization for testing, treat-
ment types, and treatment goals. For example, the decision-making between KRT and conservative care should be madeon the basis of the person ’s priorities, medical needs, and
informed decision as to bene ﬁts and harms of various op-
tions. These informed decisions require good communicationbetween caregivers, people with CKD, and their relatives/
carers; they require time, “room, ”adequate understandable
language, patience, trust, and commitment. Repeated con-
versations are critical, given the higher prevalence of cognitivedeﬁcits in older adults with CKD. These cognitive issues
accompany both aging and CKD and frequently remain un-recognized, thus, impeding shared decision-making andadvance care planning in this group.
In summary, older adults constitute the largest group
among all people with advanced CKD. Although every singleperson needs individual care, the multidimensional medicalcomplexity inherent in very old age is challenging. Wherespeciﬁc recommendations or practice points require special
consideration in the elderly, we make clear statements in thespecial considerations section and encourage clinicians toindividualize therapies and goals of care in all patients, withspecial attention to those of advanced age.
Considerations regarding sex and gender
It is increasingly recognized that sex (biological attributes)and gender (sociocultural factors) factors across individualsspecial considerations www.kidney-international.org

contribute to differences in kidney health and disease.37–39
Sex-based variation in genetics, physiology, immunology, and
anatomy, as well as gender factors such as identity, roles, andrelations in addition to institutionalized gender, in ﬂuences
kidney disease pathophysiology, presentation, response totherapy, complications, and outcomes, highlighting the needto take these factors into consideration in the care of theperson living with kidney disease.
Globally, the prevalence of CKD not being treated with
dialysis de ﬁned by level of eGFR is greater in women than
men.
40Progression of CKD has been reported as more rapid
in men,41,42in women,43or no difference by sex or gender.44
These incongruities are likely a reﬂ ection of differences in
cause of kidney disease and de ﬁnitions of outcomes (e.g.,
loss of eGFR or receipt of KRT).
There is substantial literature demonstrating that both sex-
and gender-related factors (e.g., puberty, menstrual patterns,hormonal contraception, pregnancy and pregnancy-relatedcomplications, menopause, menopausal hormone therapy,testosterone levels, and gender-af ﬁrming hormone therapy)
play important roles in the risk, progression, complications,and treatment of kidney disease.
45
These factors will play prominent roles in progression of
kidney disease across different stages of the life cycle. Forexample, the use of some recommended medications has notbeen studied in pregnant populations, highlighting theimportance of contraceptive counseling in accordance with aperson ’s values and preferences. In other instances, precon-
ception counseling, changing medications to nonteratogenicoptions and a multidisciplinary approach, is required tooptimize the outcomes of a potential pregnancy in the settingof CKD. Sex-based differences in pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics that are accentuated with increasing ageand changing hormonal status may alter the response todifferent therapies for the treatment of kidney disease. Forexample, women are more likely to report adverse reactions
to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi),
46which
play a role in adherence and failure to reach guideline-
recommended target doses.
There are differences between women and men in the
detection, recognition, monitoring, referrals, and manage-ment of CKD.
47,48Although the reasons behind these
disparities are unclear, access to kidney care may be limitedby familial and other caregiving responsibilities, as well as
ﬁnancial challenges, occupational obligations, and time
constraints, which are in ﬂuenced by gender identity (how
an individual self-identi ﬁes, behaves, expresses their gender,and is perceived by others, e.g., woman, man, girl, boy,and gender-diverse), roles (social expectations and normstypically associated with a given gender, e.g., primaryhousehold earner and caregiver), relations (interactions
with and treatment by others based on an individual ’s
perceived and/or expressed gender identity), and
institutionalized gender (e.g., distribution of power andresources in society).
37
A small but increasing proportion of the world ’s popula-
tion identi ﬁes as transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary
where sex assigned at birth differs from gender identity,highlighting the urgent need to build transgender cultural
safety within all aspects of kidney disease management and
care.
49
Taking sex and gender considerations into account is
critical to optimize the care of the individual with kidneydisease. Although there is increasing literature to inform sex-and gender-speci ﬁc recommendations in nephrology, signif-
icant knowledge gaps remain, underscoring the importance ofa person-centered approach in kidney care.
Considerations regarding fertility and pregnancy
Neither fertility nor pregnancy in people with CKD was partof the scope of work for this guideline update, but there willbe special consideration relating to fertility and pregnancyrequiring speci ﬁc reference in relevant sections of the
guideline.
Fertility. CKD is associated with decreased female and male
fertility.50,51Progressively impaired function of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis appears to play a keyrole in the pathophysiology, although multiple factorscontribute to the reduction in fertility in this population. Inconjunction with the decreased fertility associated in CKDand the uncertainty of the impact of assisted reproductivetechnologies on kidney function, ongoing discussion offamily planning potential between the person with CKD
and their healthcare provider is essential.
Pregnancy. People with CKD are at risk for adverse preg-
nancy-associated outcomes, including progression of their
underlying CKD, a ﬂare of their kidney disease, and adverse
pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, pretermdelivery, and small for gestational age infant.
52,53The severity
of CKD is associated with risk of adverse pregnancyoutcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to preconception
counseling and management of pregnancy is necessary to
achieve optimal outcomes for both the person with CKDand the infant.

Summary of relative and absolute risks relevant to CKD
from meta-analysis of large multinational population
studies in the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC)
Outcomes relevant to CKD, and the prognostic importance of
CKD categories
The most highly evaluated endpoints in epidemiological
studies have been all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events
(myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure), and kidney-speciﬁc outcomes (progression to kidney failure and AKI),
although additional outcomes such as all-cause hospitaliza-tion and incident atrial ﬁbrillation have been studied more
recently. In this section, we highlight newer data derived fromthe CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC).
12We describe
the associations of CKD categories with 10 of these
important outcomes and demonstrate the importance of
different methods of estimating GFR (i.e., using creatinine-or cystatin C –based equations) on these risk gradients.
Healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers
should understand the association of CKD parameters (ACRand eGFR) in populations. The overall distributions ofepidemiological risk across CKD categories on a populationlevel are presented here. This is not to be confused with the
information presented in Chapter 2, where individualized risk
assessment tools are described, and those tools can be used toinform clinical and management decisions for individualpeople with CKD.
Associations of all complications of CKD are incre-
mentally increased with worsened categories of estimatedglomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria:
updated data.
The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu-
ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease introducedthe combined staging by eGFR and albuminuria categories,which were justi ﬁed by their associations with CKD complica-
tions.
1The combined associations of eGFR and ACR categories
were presented as “heatmaps, ”a color-coded depiction of the
associations of increased risk with worsening CKD, foroutcomes of all-cause mortality, kidney failure, AKI, and
cardiovascular mortality on a population level. In this section,
we provide an update to these CKD heatmaps, which havebeen provided by the CKD-PC.
12
Several changes in the development of these updated
heatmaps are important to highlight.
(i) They now include several clinical databases that allow a
much larger population base, comprising up to 27,503,140people for the analyses of each adverse outcome.
(ii) The eGFRcr has been changed to the 2021 CKD Epide-
miology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, as thisnewer version no longer includes race as a component.
(iii) The number of outcomes has been increased to 10,
including 6 that are cardiovascular related, 2 that arekidney speci ﬁc (kidney failure and AKI), and 2 general
outcomes (all-cause mortality and all-causehospitalization).
(iv) Additional analyses have been conducted using the 2021
CKD-EPI combined eGFR equation that incorporatesboth creatinine and cystatin C. Although the sample sizefor these subsequent analyses is much smaller (n ¼
720,736), it does permit better differentiation of associ-ations of eGFR and risk and allows validation of CKDthresholds across populations.
CKD staging by eGFRcr and ACR and association with adverse
events
Figure 512presents the RRs for all eGFR/ACR combinations
for the 10 identi ﬁed outcomes.
The RRs presented have all been adjusted for age, sex,
smoking status (current, former, or never), systolic BP (SBP),
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,body mass index (BMI), use of antihypertensive medications,and a medical history of diabetes, coronary heart disease,
stroke, heart failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, peripheral artery dis-
ease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Therefore, the RRs can be interpreted as the proportionalelevation in risk for each outcome experienced by people inthat stage of CKD (or non-CKD) compared with people inthe healthiest group. Across all the heatmaps, a consistentcolor scheme is used.
Theﬁgures reveal several common themes and highlight
the necessity of having both eGFR and ACR parametersavailable in assessing risk. First, within the CKD popula-t i o n ,t h ea s s o c i a t i o no fr i s kf o ra l l1 0o u t c o m e si n c r e a s e swith higher stages of both eGFR and albuminuria. Theﬁgures present only the RRs for each speci ﬁcs t a g ea n dn o t
the absolute risk of experiencing that outcome for peoplein the risk cell. This distinction between relative and ab-solute risks demonstrates the importance of using indi-
vidual risk prediction tools for persons with CKD, a subject
of Chapter 2.
Although nearly all CKD categories are at substantially
elevated risk for most outcomes in Figure 5 , a distinction must be
made for people in the eGFRcr CKD G3a category and with thelowest ACR severity ( <10 mg/g [ <1m g / m m o l ] ) .T h i sg r o u pi s
portrayed in the lower-risk green color for 7 of the 10 outcomespresented, although they have 3-fold higher adjusted risk of AKI
and 13-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with the
reference group. The inconsistent risk association forpopulations with CKD G3a, A1, particularly in older adults,has led to controversy over whether this group should berelative and absolute risks associated with CKD www.kidney-international.org

repeated all 10 heatmaps using creatinine- and cystatin C –
based eGFR (eGFRcr-cys), in part to evaluate whether the
weaker associations of CKD G3a, A1 with clinical outcomeswere caused by the limitations of the speci ﬁc creatinine-based
equation eGFRcr, compared with eGFRcr-cys, which has beenestablished as a better approximation of measured GFR(mGFR) than eGFRcr ( Figure 6

higher risk for all 10 outcomes, and this cell was no longer
labeled green for any of the complications (Figure 6 ). The
distinction in these risk relationships was further exploredusing spline analyses to depict the risk relationships ofeGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys with all the 10 complications. Forthe 8 outcomes that are not in ﬂuenced by changes in
creatinine (all except kidney failure and AKI), eGFRcrexhibited a J-shaped association such that risk increasedwith eGFR values over 105 ml/min per 1.73 m
2
(Figure 712). In contrast, eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much
more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution.
Based upon the risk relationships of eGFRcr-cys and
ACR categories with all complications, the existing CKD
staging is appropriate among both younger and older
adults.
Some authors have suggested that the GFR threshold for
CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2should be raised to 75 ml/min
per 1.73 m2for younger adults and lowered to 45 ml/min per
1.73 m2for older adults.55In younger adults, the purpose of a
higher GFR threshold re ﬂects the longer risk horizon for
younger people, which could lead to higher lifetime CKD
progression risks for a given GFR stage. However, the
higher lifetime progression risks in younger adults withGFR 60 –89 ml/min per 1.73 m
2can be addressed in their
management without changing the de ﬁnition of CKD.Efforts should be directed at people with higher risk withGFR levels >60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2to prevent the
incidence of CKD or further reductions in GFR.
Among older adults, the ﬁndings of consistently elevated
RR for older adults with CKD G3a, A1, as de ﬁned by eGFRcr-
cys, support the inclusion of this large group in the CKD
population. These elevated RRs tell us how much more likely
the outcome is compared with the reference group (eGFR 90 –
104 ml/min per 1.73 m2and ACR <10 mg/g [< 1 mg/
mmol]). Crucially, they do not tell us what the overall like-lihood of the outcome, the absolute risk, is. The absolute riskfor important CKD complications is higher among older thanyounger adults at nearly every stage, particularly for CVD,heart failure, and mortality. Therefore, this population is also
likely to bene ﬁt from having their CKD diagnosed, staged,
and treated.
Rationale for using cystatin C containing equations for CKD
staging
The rationale for using cystatin C versus SCr, or a combi-
nation of both, in eGFR equations is that creatinine, which isdirectly linked to muscle mass, may be misleading at extremes
of body habitus, or in speci ﬁc conditions (spinal cord injuries
and sarcopenia), and that cystatin C is impacted by different
variables (steroid use, thyroid disease, and cancer). Thus,because neither is a perfect marker to use for estimating

Very low levels of SCr often represent poor health status,
such as frailty or sarcopenia, which limits the production ofcreatinine. This biological feature of creatinine (i.e., relationto muscle mass) has limited its prognostic utility and resultsin reducing the risk associations for eGFRcr 45 –60 ml/min
per 1.73 m
2and elevating risks for eGFRcr >110 ml/min per1.73 m2. These limitations are not observed when risk is
estimated using eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C –based eGFR
(eGFRcys) (Figure 7 ).
When comparing GFR estimates using these 2 ﬁltration
markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for mostoutcomes for eGFRcys in comparison with eGFRcr. Therefore,for the purpose of evaluating the association of eGFR withoutcomes (i.e., projecting prognosis for people with CKD), theeGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.relative and absolute risks associated with CKD www.kidney-international.org

Summary of recommendation statements and practice
points
Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD
1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD
1.1.1 Detection of CKD
Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin mea-
surement and assessment of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).
Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria,
or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to con ﬁrm presence of CKD.
1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD
Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomer-
ularﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be
estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin
C–based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B).
1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity
Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by:
(i) review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;
(ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic
examinations;
(iii) imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness;
(iv) kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and atrophy;
(v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD;
(vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point.
Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding
could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD).
Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR
if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators.
1.1.4 Evaluation of causePractice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and envi-
ronmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic
and pathologic diagnosis ( Figure 8).www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S149
Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause based on resources available ( Table 622,98-100).
Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to
evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate (2D).
1.2 Evaluation of GFR
1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFRPractice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR ”when referring to the speci ﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use the

1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers
Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR ( Figure 11 ).
Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less accurate
and GFR affects clinical decision-making ( Table 8127-142)(1C).
Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using
plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous ﬁltration marker ( Table 9).
Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations in both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR)
as well as the variability and factors that in ﬂuence SCr and cystatin C measurements.
Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake.Initial test – eGFRcr*

Figure 11 | Approach to glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests. The algorithm describes the
approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a ﬁnal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in
individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most
people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a moreaccurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C –based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys
is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR shouldbe measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous ﬁltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or
eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in musclemass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speci ﬁc medications.
†Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low
muscle mass or very high levels of in ﬂammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.‡Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in
otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion orextrarenal elimination due to the use of speci ﬁc medications.www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points

Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.
Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C –based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some speci ﬁc
circumstances.
Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may be infor-
mative, in both direction and magnitude of those differences.
Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections for measured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and
eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate.
1.2.3 Guidance to clinical laboratories
Practice Point 1.2.3.1: Implement the laboratory standards of care outlined in Table 11 to ensure accuracy and reliability
when assessing GFR using creatinine and cystatin C.
Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurement of both
creatinine and cystatin either as an in-house test or as a referred test.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in infants or small children must ensure their quality control
process include the lowest end of the expected range of values for the group of interest.
Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher relative
contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to measured creatinine in children when using the
Jaffe assay, and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samples in the neonatal period.
Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2can be ﬂagged as “low”in children and adolescents over the
age of 2 years.Table 9 | Comparison of estimated GFR and measured GFR

1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations
Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum
ﬁltration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum ﬁltration markers alone (1D).
Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as de ﬁned locally [e.g., continent, country,
region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children.
Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children using validated equations that have been developed or validated in
comparable populations.
1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria
1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers
Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of pref-
erence). In all cases, a ﬁrst void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and
children.
(i)urine ACR, or
(ii)reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading.
If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements:
(i)urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR),
(ii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or
(iii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading.
Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods.
/C15Conﬁrm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory mea-
surement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (i.e., quantify the ACR or
PCR if initial semiquantitative tests are positive).
/C15Conﬁrm ACR ‡30 mg/g ( ‡3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent ﬁrst
morning void in the morning midstream urine sample.
Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine
creatinine and order con ﬁrmatory tests as indicated ( Table 16 ).

Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a ﬁrst morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria
(in descending order of preference):
(i)Both urine PCR and urine ACR,
(ii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading, or
(iii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading.
1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories
Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure accuracy
and reliability of the ﬁndings when assessing urine samples.
Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creati-
nine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories.
1.4 Point-of-care testing
Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine
albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the
point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C).
Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creat inine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same pre-
analytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and perfor-
mance of the device, including external quality asses sment, and the interpretation of the result is used.
Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the
equation consistent with that used within the region.
Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing
creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices toproduce a positive result in 85% of people with signi ﬁcant albuminuria (ACR ‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/
mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device.
Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD
2.1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories
Practice Point 2.1.1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in
people with CKD.
Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more o ften for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression
when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions.
Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected
variability and warrants evaluation.
Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of
>30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation.
Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test
exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.Table 17 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of urine samples

2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD
Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3– G5, we recommend using an externally validated risk equation
to estimate the absolute risk of kidney failure (1A).
Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% –5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in
addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations.
Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care
in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations.
Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of >40% can be used to determine the modality education,
timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or
referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations.
Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3 –G5, may not
be valid for use in those with CKD G1 –G2.
Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speci ﬁc, externally validated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin
A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with CKD
Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use
externally validated models that are either de veloped within CKD populations or that incor-
porate eGFR and albuminuria.
Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validated
models that predict all-cause mortality speci ﬁcally developed in the CKD population.

3.2.2 Physical activity and optimum weight
The Work Group concurs with all the recommendation and practice points relating to physical activity from the KDIGO 2022
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23and considers that they should extend to all
adults with CKD. We draw attention to the following statements:
Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that people with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-intensity
physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a
level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D).
Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical activity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of other
comorbidities, and access to resources.
Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior.
Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensity of physical
activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and the type of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both).
Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD to undertake physical activity a iming for World Health Organization
(WHO)-advised levels (i.e., ‡60 minutes daily) and to achieve a healthy weight.
3.3 Diet
Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based
foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.
Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about dietary
adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potassium, and protein intake, tailored to their indi-
vidual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions.
3.3.1 Protein intake
Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with
CKD G3– G5(2C).
Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression.
Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, consider
prescribing, under close supervision, a very low –protein diet (0.3 –0.4 g/kg body weight/d) sup-
plemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kg body weight/d).
Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low –protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake in children with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The
target protein and energy intake in children with CKD G2 –G5 should be at the upper end of the
normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth.
Older adults.
Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlying conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higher protein
and calorie dietary targets.
3.3.2 Sodium intake
The Work Group concurs with the following recommendation from KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes
Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23and the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood
Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease .21
Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium
per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD (2C).www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S157
Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based Recommended Daily Intake when counseling about sodium intake for children with
CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height.
3.4 Blood pressure control
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic
Kidney Disease , which encourages individualized BP targets and the use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, and other
comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and tolerance to treatments.21We highlight the following guidance:
Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure
(SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of ﬁce BP measurement (2B).
Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures,
very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic
Kidney Disease , and we highlight the following guidance21:
Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to £50th percentile
for age, sex, and height (2C).
Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3 –6 months with standardized auscultatory of ﬁce
BP in children with CKD.
Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatory
ofﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting, of 50th –75th percentile for age, sex, and
height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension.
3.5 Glycemic controlPlease refer to the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease for speci ﬁc
recommendations, practice points, and research recommendations.
3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
The Work Group highlights recommendations from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood
Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease
21and the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23The Work Group considers several
recommendations to apply even in the absence of high BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BP guideline toremove this requirement. Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted:
Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people
with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A3) without diabetes (1B).
Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increased
albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2) without diabetes (2C).
Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately-to-
severely increased albuminuria (G1– G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B).
Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor
(DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B).summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points www.kidney-international.org
S158 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to
achieve the bene ﬁts described because the proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses.
Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2 –4 weeks of
initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.
Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum
potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi.
Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks
following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose.
Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hy-
potension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms
while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or
ARB) for speci ﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction).
Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney
Disease , which stated: “We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per
1.73 m
2with an SGLT2i (1A). ”23However, in the present guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation for adults with
CKD. We also highlight practice points from the KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management in CKD, which are also
relevant for people with CKD without diabetes:
Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/
min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A).
Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below
20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated.
Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical
illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis).
Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A):
/C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or
/C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria.
Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the
reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.
Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR
<200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B).
3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)
The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice points from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .23
Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney
or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for adults with T2D, an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, normal
serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]) despite
maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).
Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression
and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persis tent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care
therapies.www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S159
Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults.
Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select people with consistently normal serum potassium concen-
tration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA ( Figure 26 ).
Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or
cardiovascular bene ﬁts.
Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory
hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly
among people with a low GFR.
3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA)
The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice point from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .23
Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets
despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, or who are unable to use
those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B).
Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene ﬁts.
3.10 Metabolic acidosis
Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary
intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum
bicarbonate <18 mmol/l in adults).
Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate
concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control,
serum potassium, or ﬂuid status.
3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD
3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium measurement
Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of potassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and mech-
anisms that may in ﬂuence potassium measurement including diurnal and seasonal variation,
plasma versus serum samples, and the actions of medications.
3.11.2 Potassium exchange agentsPractice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologic man-
agement of nonemergent hyperkalemia.
3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moderate and severe hyperkalemia in adults
[No recommendations and practice points]K+ ≤4.8 mmol/l K+ 4.9–5.5 mmol/l K+ >5.5 mmol/l
• Initiate finerenone
  - 10 mg daily if eGFR 25–59 ml/min/1.73 m2
  - 20 mg daily if eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2
• Monitor K+ at 1 month after initiation and then every 4
  months
• Increase dose to 20 mg daily, if on 10 mg daily
• Restart 10 mg daily if previously held for hyperkalemia and
  K+ now ≤5.0 mmol/l• Continue finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg
• Monitor K+ every 4 months• Hold finerenone
• Consider adjustments to diet or concomitant
  medications to mitigate hyperkalemia
• Recheck K+
• Consider reinitiation if/when K+ ≤5.0 mmol/l

DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD). The Work Group considersthese potassium thresholds to be conservative, and it may be considered appropriate to continue MRAs in people with potassium of 5.5 –6.0 mmol/
l. This algorithm could be used for steroidal MRA. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved initiation of Kþ<5.0 mmol/l. This
ﬁgure is guided by trial design and the FDA label and may be different in other countries. Serum creatinine/estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) should be monitored concurrently with serum potassium. Reproduced from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Diabetes WorkGroup.

3.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia
[No recommendations and practice points]
3.11.5 Dietary considerations
Practice Point 3.11.5.1: Implement an individualized approach in people with CKD G3 –G5 and emergent hyperkalemia that
includes dietary and pharmacologic interventions and takes into consideration associated comor-
bidities and quality of life (QoL). Assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accreditednutrition provider are advised.
Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of f oods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods)
for people with CKD G3 –G5 who have a history of hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy
during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease –Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) .
20Please refer to this publication for speci ﬁc
recommendations, selection, dosing of speci ﬁc therapeutic agents, and research recommendations.
3.14 Hyperuricemia
Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered
uric acid –lowering intervention (1C).
Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid– lowering therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout
(particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is >9 mg/dl
[535mmol/l]).
Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and
symptomatic hyperuricemia.
Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glu-
cocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Dietary approaches.
Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and
high-fructose corn syrup intake.
Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and
asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D).
3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional speci ﬁc interventions to modify risk
3.15.1 Lipid managementThe bene ﬁts of lowering LDL cholesterol using statin-based therapies on the risk of ASCVD are well established in people with
and without CKD. There are clear recommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out in the KDIGO Clinical Practice
Guideline for Lipid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .
19The Work Group concurs with all the recommendations in this
guideline. In particular, we draw attention to:www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S161
Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged ‡50 years with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2but not treated with
chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a –G5), we recom-
mend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A).
Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged ‡50 years with CKD and eGFR ‡60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR cate-
gories G1 –G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B).
Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18 –49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney
transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the
following (2A):
/C15known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization),
/C15diabetes mellitus,
/C15prior ischemic stroke, or
/C15estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction
>10% .
Practice Point 3.15.1.1: Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool.
Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largest treatment bene ﬁts.
Practice Point 3.15.1.3: In adults with CKD aged 18 –49, a lower (i.e., <10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death
or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also be appropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-based
therapy.
Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors to people
with CKD who have an indication for their use.
Dietary approaches.
Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based “Mediterranean-style ”diet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to reduce
cardiovascular risk.
3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy
Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic cardio-
vascular disease events (i.e., secondary prevention) in people with CKD and
established ischemic cardiovascular disease (1C).
Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance.
3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary artery disease
Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable stress-test con ﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an initial
conservative approach using intensive medical therapy is an appropriate alterna-
tive to an initial invasive strategy (2D).
Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an invasive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKD with
acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levels of angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left
ventricular systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease.summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points www.kidney-international.org

3.16 CKD and atrial ﬁbrillation
Practice Point 3.16.1: Follow established strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation ( Figure 40 ).
Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of non –vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in
preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial
ﬁbrillation in people with CKD G1– G4(1C).
Practice Point 3.16.2: NOAC dose adjustment for GFR is required, with caution needed at CKD G4 –G5.
Practice Point 3.16.3: Duration of NOAC discontinuation before elective procedures needs to consider procedural bleeding
risk, NOAC prescribed, and level of GFR ( Figure 44 ). Step 1
Diagnosis• In people with CKD, use opportunistic pulse-based screening (e.g., taking at when measuring BP), followed by a
  wearable device or Holter ECG testing
Step 2
Prophylaxis against
stroke and systemic
thromboembolism  (they are likely to have an increased CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor for stroke and are at high risk even with a score of 0–1)
  managed (e.g., alcohol advice, use of a proton pump inhibitor) 
Step 3
Rate/rhythm control†
• Use medical therapy (e.g., beta blockade) to control ventricular rate to less than about 90 bpm at rest to decrease
  symptoms and related complications
• For people with persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control, consider rhythm control with cardioversion,
  antiarrhythmic therapy and/or catheter ablation 
Figure 40 | Strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation. * Consider dose adjustments necessary in people with
chronic kidney disease (CKD).†The following has been recommended as a standard package for diagnostic evaluation of new atrial ﬁbrillation:
(i) a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to establish the diagnosis, assess ventricular rate, and check for the presence of conduction defects,
ischemia, or structural heart disease; (ii) laboratory testing for thyroid and kidney function, serum electrolytes, and full blood count; and (iii)transthoracic echocardiography to assess left ventricular size and function, left atrial size, for valvular disease, and right heart size and function.BP, blood pressure; CHA

Chapter 4: Medication management and drug stewardship in CKD
4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety
Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. When prescribing
such medications to people with CKD, always consider the bene ﬁts versus potential harms.
Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and therapeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people with CKD
receiving medications with narrow therapeutic windows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity,
both in outpatient practice and in hospital settings.
Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the-counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that may be
harmful for people with CKD.
Medications and pregnancy.
Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications to people with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, always review
teratogenicity potential and provide regular reproductive and contraceptive counseling in accordancewith the values and preferences of the person with CKD.
4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR
Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys.
Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings, validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate for drug
dosing.
Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow ther-
apeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable,
use of equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR may be indicated.Apixaban–Edoxaban–Rivaroxaban Dabigatran

Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of body weight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) may be
indicated, especially for medications with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum
concentration to be effective.
Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration
markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state.
4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship
Practice Point 4.3.1: Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence,
continued indication, and potential drug interactions because people with CKD often have complex
medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists.
Practice Point 4.3.2: If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when to restart
the discontinued medications to the affected person and healthcare providers, and ensure docu-mentation in the medical record.
Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation of medications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i) in
the 48 –72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a
precautionary measure to prevent complications. However, note that failure to restart these medi-cations after the event or procedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point 4.3.2).
4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship
Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected bene ﬁts and possible risks of medi-
cations so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed.
Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationsh ips with other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/or
use tools to ensure and improve drug stewards hip in people with CKD to enhance management
of their complex medication regimens.
4.4 Imaging studies
Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imaging studies in accordance with general population in-
dications. Risks and bene ﬁts of imaging studies should be determined on an individual
basis in the context of their CKD.
4.4.1 Radiocontrast: intra-arterial and intravenous dye studiesPractice Point 4.4.1.1: Assess the risk for AKI in people wit h CKD receiving intra-arterial contrast for cardiac pro-
cedures using validated tools.
Practice Point 4.4.1.2: The intravenous administration of radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance with
consensus statements from the radiology societies in people with AKI or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73
m
2(CKD G3a –G5) undergoing elective investigation.
4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast mediaPractice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m

Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD
1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD
Both decreased GFR and increased albuminuria or other
markers of kidney damage are often silent and not apparent tot h ep e r s o na tr i s ko fC K Do rt h eh e a l t h c a r ep r o v i d e ru n l e s slaboratory tests are performed. The cause of the decreased GFRor increased albuminuria may also not be apparent. In the
decade since the publication of the previous KDIGO Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease,
1there have been substantial advances
in treatment for CKD of all causes (Chapter 3), targetedtherapies for speci ﬁc causes of CKD (e.g., KDIGO 2021
Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management ofGlomerular Diseases
22), as well as understanding of and
methods to determine the etiology of CKD. All together, these
advances have the potential to slow and possibly prevent the
progression of kidney disease. Thus, in this section of Chapter1, we emphasize the importance of detecting CKD, andconsiderations for the optimal methods for staging of CKD,and how to establish chronicity and etiology.
1.1.1 Detection of CKD
Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronickidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurementand assessment of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD,
provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treat-ments can be initiated earlier in the disease course. Becausetreatments for CKD provide bene ﬁts in reducing risk for both
CVD and CKD progression, strategies that promote earlydetection of CKD should improve kidney and non –kidney-
related outcomes. Even if medical treatments are not available
or indicated for an individual, there are recommended lifestyle
changes that could be implemented after the diagnosis of CKD(Chapter 3). Interviews with people who have CKD have pro-vided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if theyreceived a diagnosis of CKD.
17Knowledge of level of
albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisionsbeyond initiating treatments speci ﬁcally for CKD ( Table 4 ).
Each of these is considered in greater depth in the subsequent
chapters. Finally, if a familial form of kidney disease is
suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person mayallow detection in other family members. Thus, initial testingof blood and urine to detect CKD is important, withconﬁrmatory testing if initial ﬁndings indicate the presence of
abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.
From a societal perspective, early identi ﬁcation of and
intervention for CKD could have a positive impact on health
disparities. In many countries, there is a higher incidence of CKD
among people with lower SES, and these people are more likelyto progress to kidney failure and have less access to KRT (dialysis

and transplantation).56A public health approach toward CKD
detection and treatment could reduce inequities in the burden
of kidney failure by slowing the rate of progression and therisk of CVD for everyone.
57
The possible harm of early detection of CKD is that the
new diagnosis may cause anxiety in some people, particularlyif the testing is not discussed in advance of the results. Dis-cussions around disease detection are common in the primarycare setting, and shared decision-making is an establishedpractice through which people may agree to the testing,conﬁrm that they would like to be tested, and prepare for the
range of possible results and their implications.
58–60Early
detection increases burden and costs associated with physi-cian visits or treatments, and this may not be balanced bysavings from averting adverse outcomes.
CKD ﬁts the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for
an early detection program.
61–63Given that chronic disease
detection and prevention frameworks have been deployed forother disease and risk factor conditions, in our view, CKDdetection strategies should be implemented for high-risk people.
A framework has been developed for communities to align
CKD detection and treatment strategies within their broaderpublic health priorities to ensure that the goals of the interven-tion are achieved without compromising other valuable healthinitiatives.
26Both the ef ﬁcacy and the cost-effectiveness of CKD
detection and treatment interventions will depend upon thespeciﬁc strategies that are employed in the healthcare system.
Therefore, results from future clinical trials should be
evaluated within their unique context and may not generalize
to all CKD detection efforts.
Most people with or at risk for CKD, healthcare providers, and
policy makers would wish to identify CKD. Most people who arealready receiving medical care would choose case- ﬁnding stra-
tegies to enable earlier risk strati ﬁcation and treatment for pre-
viously undiagnosed CKD.
17,64Thus, the application of earlier
treatment to delay CKD progression in people with CKD is of
a higher priority than the lack of clinical trial evidence that
case-ﬁnding strategies themselves improve outcomes.
This practice point promoting CKD detection efforts may
have implications for health equity, because CKD dispro-portionately affects people from minoritized populations andthose who have lower SES. The increasing availability andevidence supporting several treatments for CKD advocates forearly disease detection. Given the asymptomatic progression
of CKD, systematic testing of people with risk factors for
CKD is the only method that would detect CKD at earlystages and allow the initiation of appropriate treatments.CKD detection could reduce the proportion of people withCKD who will experience the morbidity of CKD G4 –G5.
Cost-effectiveness analyses, performed in the new era ofeffective disease-modifying therapies, describe a more positiveview of population-wide screening.
27
Figure 328provides an algorithm for the identi ﬁcation of
people at risk for CKD testing in those at risk, furthertesting in those identi ﬁed as having CKD to con ﬁrm stages,and subsequently allowing for treatment initiation. Primarycare physicians or other medical specialists who care forpeople with risk factors for CKD, such as endocrinology,cardiology, or rheumatology, are ideal settings for an
intervention that targets people with undetected CKD.
Implementing an early detection intervention would befacilitated by integrated healthcare systems and the use ofelectronic health records. These structures would facilitatethe linkage between risk strati ﬁcation and treatment to have
the desired effect of slowing the progression of CKD.
The highest priority conditions for CKD detection are
hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, including heart failure. For
diabetes, the ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening
of people with diabetes for CKD.
29CKD screening should
start at diagnosis of T2D because evidence of CKD is oftenalready apparent at this time. For T1D, screening isrecommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. Asecond important group includes people with recent AKI oracute kidney disease (AKD), particularly multiple episodesof AKI, and those who have been “partially diagnosed ”with
CKD by either eGFR or albuminuria but cannot be fullystaged. Other groups who might be considered for CKDtesting are shown in Table 5 . This list is not exhaustive and
may be modi ﬁed by local epidemiological considerations. As
per above, 2023 analyses suggest that population screeningmay in fact be cost-effective, obviating the need for“selecting ”and addressing an ever-changing list of “at risk ”
groups.
27
Testing for CKD without regard to age generates contro-
versy. Those in older age groups experience the greatestburden of CKD and are also at the highest risk for cardio-vascular complications. As with other detection programs likecancer detection, CKD detection efforts should be individu-alized based on the person ’s goals of care and suitability for
treatment.
Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of
elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), he-maturia, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests toconﬁrm presence of CKD.
There is known biological and analytical variability in SCr
and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to theirproperties as markers of kidney disease. In people withoutrisk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for
CKD. Thus, any unexpected results should be veri ﬁed before
diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk
factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the persondoes have CKD even with an unexpected ﬁnding. Subsequent
testing should be performed to con ﬁrm the diagnosis and to
complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeatsample should be determined based on clinical settingincluding risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/
AKD.
Hematuria is common and associated with risk for sub-
sequent development of CKD.
65There are several causes ofchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org
S170 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
transient hematuria. Persistent hematuria may indicate
glomerular disease, other kidney diseases, or urologicdisease including genitourinary malignancy. Thus, persistent
hematuria should prompt further investigation.
66,67
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. People who are born preterm,
especially if also small for gestational age, are at increased riskfor CKD and kidney failure. This is largely related to
decreased nephron number.
68–70Additional insults after birth
such as neonatal AKI and childhood obesity can further in-crease the risk of CKD.
71,72
1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD
Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD,
we recommend using creatinine-based estimatedglomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is
available, the GFR category should be estimatedfrom the combination of creatinine and cystatin C(creatinine and cystatin C –based estimated glomer-
ularﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B).
For the diagnosis and staging of CKD by GFR, this recom-
mendation puts a high value on data suggesting that the most
accurate method of estimating GFR is by using 2 biomarkers(cystatin C and creatinine), as each has limitations and bene ﬁts
asﬁltration markers. As compared with mGFR, estimatingequations using both creatinine and cystatin C afford greateraccuracy in comparison with either ﬁltration marker alone. The
recommendation places a lower value on the resource utilization
and cost associated with the assessment of eGFRcr-cys.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. In the CKD-PC collabora-
tion, 720,736 people had measures of blood cystatin C in addi-tion to having eGFRcr and ACR.
12Replacing the assessment of
eGFRcr with eGFRcr-cys in the matrix of GFR categories led
to several changes in the risk distributions. Most notably, thegroup with an eGFR category 45 –59 ml/min per 1.73 m
2and
ACR<10 mg/g ( <1 mg/mmol) was moved to higher risk for
all 10 outcomes, and this category was no longer labeledas being low-risk ( “green ”) for any of the complications
(Figure 6
12). For the 8 outcomes that are not in ﬂuenced by
changes in creatinine (i.e. all except kidney failure and AKI),eGFRcr exhibited a J-shaped association such that riskincreased with eGFR values >105 ml/min per 1.73 m
2
(Figure 712). In contrast eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much
more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution. These data demonstrate that thecombined eGFRcr-cys equation is superior for distinguishingGFR risk stages compared with eGFRcr.
Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on 2
broadly different types of data —data comparing the accuracy
(P30) of equations from a combination of creatinine and
cystatin C as ﬁltration markers and creatinine and cystatin CTable 5 | Risk factors for CKD

alone and data from the CKD-PC examining the risk of
outcome by GFR stage assessed by eGFRcr compared witheGFRcr-cys. As compared with equations based on creatinineand cystatin C alone, the equation using both creatinine and
cystatin C comes closest to mGFR most consistently
(Supplementary Table S3
73–96). The CKD-PC data were an
individual-level data analysis of 27,503,140 participantsfrom 114 global cohorts (eGFRcr) and 720,736 participantsfrom 20 cohorts (eGFRcr-cys) and 9,067,753 participantsfrom 114 cohorts (albuminuria) from 1980 to 2021 fromaround the world conveying a high degree of robustness inthe association of CKD stage with a broad range of adverse
outcomes. Based on the totality and consistency of the
CKD-PC data, the overall certainty of the evidence wasrated as moderate.
Values and preferences. This recommendation places a high
value on the need for the most accurate assessment of GFR.The Work Group judged that many people at risk for CKDwould prefer an accurate measurement when con ﬁrming the
diagnosis of CKD and its staging. For this reason, the Work
Group prioritized eGFRcr-cys over eGFRcr or eGFRcys for
the most accurate measurement. The recommendation puts alow value on the availability and cost of an assessment ofeGFRcr-cys suggesting that people at risk of CKD would optfor the more accurate assessment.
Resource use and costs. The costs and resource use associ-
ated with eGFRcr-cys are currently greater than those ofeGFRcr; however, the need for an accurate measurement may
offset these expenses. In addition, accurate diagnosis of CKD
as early as possible may lead to lower resource utilization andhealthcare spending than if diagnosed in later stages of CKD.For more information on the costs associated with cystatin Cassessments, please refer to Section 1.2.2 .
Considerations for implementation. The biggest consideration
for implementation is the availability of cystatin C measurement.For this reason, the recommendation includes the alternative for
eGFRcr in such cases taking into consideration the limitations
and drawbacks of creatinine-based measurements.
Rationale
The KDIGO CKD staging system based on 2 dimensions,GFR and albuminuria, was created largely to re ﬂect the as-
sociation of outcomes of people with CKD, relative to theearlier staging systems based solely on GFR stages. Assessmentof GFR stage is ideally performed using accurate assessmentof GFR and ACR and is used to best capture the prognosis for
people with CKD with regard to outcomes such as kidney
failure, CVD, and mortality risk. There is now a large evi-dence base demonstrating that the use of eGFRcr-cys reclas-siﬁes a large proportion of the population into different GFR
stages and the “new”stages better re ﬂect their risk associa-
tions. For that reason, where available, cystatin C should beadded to creatinine for the purpose of estimating GFR forCKD diagnosis and staging.1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity
Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of aminimum of 3 months) can be established by:
(i)review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;
(ii)review of past measurements of albuminuria orproteinuria and urine microscopic examinations;
(iii)imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and
reduction in cortical thickness;
(iv)kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and
atrophy;
(v)medical history, especially conditions known tocause or contribute to CKD;
(vi)repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point.
Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity basedupon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the
ﬁnding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury
(AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD).
Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for
CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated
ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other
clinical indicators.
Kidney diseases may be acute or chronic.
1,97We explicitly
yet arbitrarily de ﬁne the duration of a minimum of 3 months
(>90 days) as delineating “chronic ”kidney disease. The
rationale for de ﬁning chronicity is to differentiate CKD
from AKDs (such as acute glomerulonephritis [GN]),
including AKI, which may require different timelines forinitiation of treatments, different interventions, and have
different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney
disease may be documented or inferred based on theclinical context. For example, a person with decreased GFRor kidney damage during an acute illness, without priordocumentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to haveAKD. Resolution over days to weeks would con ﬁrm the
diagnosis of AKI from a variety of different causes. Aperson with similar ﬁndings in the absence of an acute
illness may be inferred to have CKD, and if followed overtime, would be con ﬁrmed to have CKD. In both cases,
repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage isrecommended for accurate diagnosis and staging. Thetiming of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, withearlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI andlater evaluation for those suspected of having CKD.
For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diag-
nosis for the sake of con ﬁrming chronicity can delay
care. Many people may not recognize the importance ofa repeat visit if treatment had not been initiated. Thus,initiating treatment both allows for earlier interventionand also indicates to people the importance of thedisease.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org

Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Newborns who clearly have kidney
disease (e.g., severe congenital malformations of the kidney and
urinary tract) do not need to wait 3 months to con ﬁrm CKD.
1.1.4 Evaluation of cause
Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD usingclinical context, personal and family history, social andenvironmental factors, medications, physical examination,laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologicdiagnosis ( Figure 8).
Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause basedon resources available ( Table 6
22,98-100).
In evaluation of cause, healthcare providers should select
speciﬁc diagnostic tests based on the pretest probability of a
speciﬁc diagnosis informed by clinical presentation. Identi ﬁca-
tion of cause confers bene ﬁt for targeting therapy to slow pro-
gression to kidney failure, understanding contributing factors,and prognosis. In addition, identi ﬁcation of cause can help
people communicate information about a genetic or familialcause to relatives, improve understanding of their condition in
the context of self-care management, and improve health literacy.
Genetic testing is emerging as a valuable component for
evaluation of cause. In some studies, >10% of people with
CKD, regardless of family history, were observed to carry
genetic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant(s) thatrepresent a plausible molecular cause for the development orprogression of CKD.
101–103In some cases, identi ﬁcation of
actionable genes through genetic testing can impact the
clinical management of people with CKD ( Figure 9100).104,105
The prevalence of genetic causes to CKD is expected to
increase in future years through increased recognition.
A recent KDIGO Controversies Conference listed the following
recommendations for when genetic testing can be particularlyinformative: (i) high prevalence of monogenic subtypes within theclinical category, (ii) early age of onset of CKD, (iii) syndromic/multisystem features, (iv) consanguinity, (v) possibility of iden-tifying a condition amenable to targeted treatment, and (vi) CKD/
kidney failure of unknown etiology when kidney biopsy would not
be informative due to advanced disease.
100
The KDIGO Controversies Conference also highlighted
the importance of an educated workforce with expertise inkidney genetics, genomics, and computational research forappropriate use and interpretation of these tests (Figure10
100). Access to genetic counseling and medical genetics is
important for psychosocial support, appropriate use of
genetic testing, and to limit costs.102
Most people with a new diagnosis of CKD and their
healthcare providers would prefer to undertake evaluation for
the underlying cause to ensure that the best possible care isprovided. Although some people identi ﬁed as having CKD
may prefer not to undergo the (sometimes invasive) pro-cedures to evaluate cause, establishing cause enables the mostappropriate management strategy to be implemented.
Resources available for evaluation of cause will vary
worldwide. People may not be able to pay for some diagnostictests. Therefore, healthcare providers should tailor the eval-uation of cause based on these resource constraints (e.g.,urine protein reagent strip testing instead of ACR).
Education on the value of establishing a diagnosis of CKD
is critical. This can be done through local, national, and in-ternational kidney societies and within healthcare training
programs (Chapter 5 ). Additional resources may be required
to support wider scale implementation of diagnostic tests,
especially genetic testing, availability of biopsies, and thesupport required for implementation.
Identi ﬁcation of cause is often achieved by standard clin-
ical methods (i.e., history and examination), knowledge of thecauses of CKD and their manifestations (i.e., level of GFR andspeciﬁc marker of kidney damage such as hematuria, urine
albumin, or cysts), together with specialized investigations(Figure 8 ). Not all evaluations of cause are required in all
people. Information from the clinical context and initialtests may lead to further evaluations ( Table 6 ), which are
likely to be conducted as part of specialized kidney careservices and dependent on resources (Chapter 5 ).
Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a
kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test
to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions
when clinically appropriate (2D).
This recommendation places a high value on an acceptable safety
proﬁle of kidney biopsies when used to evaluate the cause of
CKD and to plan appropriate treatment.

providers are through improved understanding of the iden-
tiﬁed disease state and the extent of active and chronic lesions.
The harms include the possibility of complications of theprocedure (bleeding risk/pain), the obtaining of a non-diagnostic or insuf ﬁcient sample (wasted resource), and the
anxiety induced while awaiting the results.
The systematic review performed by the ERT identi ﬁed 37
studies assessing the prognostic bene ﬁt and safety of kidney
biopsy among people with CKD. Ten studies examined thediagnostic and/or prognostic bene ﬁt of kidney biopsy or in-
ﬂuence of biopsy results on management decisions. Thediagnostic ﬁndings were heterogeneous and variable, which
did not lend themselves to further synthesis. The rate ofmortality after native kidney biopsy in people with suspectedor diagnosed CKD was low. Across the 15 studies that re-ported on mortality after a native kidney biopsy, there were 3reported deaths. The rate of perirenal hematoma across 14studies was estimated to be 16% (95% con ﬁdence interval
[CI]: 12% –22%). No studies reported on retroperitoneal
hemorrhage (Supplementary Table S4
106–126).
Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for
kidney biopsy and outcomes of harms is very low ( Supplementary
Table S4106– 126). The critical outcomes, mortality and perirenal
hematomas, were primarily assessed in observational studieswithout a comparison group. Because of the potential forconfounding, the ERT considered the body of evidence to haveTable 6 | Guidance for the selection of additional tests for evaluation of cause

serious study limitations. The certainty of the evidence for
mortality was further downgraded because there were fewevents reported. The certainty of the evidence for perirenal
hematomas was downgraded because there was signi ﬁcant
statistical heterogeneity in the results across studies. The ERT
did not identify any studies that reported on the criticaloutcome of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that many
people with CKD would choose to undergo a kidney biopsyto establish the cause of their CKD more accurately andpotentially offer prognostic information. Thus, this recom-
mendation puts a high value on the speci ﬁcity of a kidney
biopsy for the evaluation of cause as well as the very low
certainty evidence demonstrating a low risk of complicationsassociated with kidney biopsy. Because the potential that theinformation gleaned from the biopsy may not directly orimmediately bene ﬁt the person, the Work Group judged that
some people may prefer to decline a kidney biopsy. The de-cision to pursue biopsy should be a shared decision and be
informed by probability of and utility of the information
obtained on both diagnostic and prognostic fronts.
Resource use and costs. Resources available for evaluation
of cause will vary worldwide and is dependent on thehealthcare systems. People with CKD may not be able to payfor biopsy or afford the time away from work for the pro-cedure. Resources in speci ﬁc countries may not permit
appropriate analysis of the obtained samples. Thus, healthcare
providers ’decisions to perform a kidney biopsy in the pres-
ence of limited resources may therefore be in ﬂuenced based
on expected yield for that individual and the perceived value
of the extra information gained.Considerations for implementation. To optimize bene ﬁt and
safety, a standardized approach for kidney biopsy with avetted and standardized operating protocol designed for localimplementation is warranted. Of note, most studies reportedusing ultrasound-guided biopsies and older literature sug-gesting higher bleeding rates were conducted in the absence
of guided biopsies; thus, we might infer that there is a po-
tential for higher rate of harms in “blind ”/unguided biopsies.
Rationale
Kidney biopsy is an important part of the investigations forthe cause of CKD. It is often deferred because of the potentialfor harm or lack of recognition of potential utility. The evi-dence to support safety of biopsy is heterogeneous andtherefore uncertain, but in the studies evaluated, appears toconfer low risk of harm, supporting our suggestion thatkidney biopsies should be considered when it is thought thatthey can provide information to identify cause, facilitate
prognostication, and inform treatment strategies.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Children and young people with
kidney failure are more likely to have a genetic cause of theirdisease than adults. In some healthcare settings, genetic
testing may be pursued ﬁrst, obviating the need for kidney
biopsy and the associated risks, which may be different inchildren than adults.

excretory function but is widely accepted as the best overall
index of kidney function because it is generally reduced afterwidespread structural damage and most other kidney func-tions decline in parallel with GFR in CKD.
In this section, we describe the overall approach for the
evaluation of GFR. As in the previous KDIGO ClinicalPractice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease,
1theﬁrst method to evaluate GFR
should be eGFRcr. If necessary for greater accuracy, theapproach then recommends subsequent supportive testsfrom either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurementof GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous
ﬁltration markers. In contrast to the previous guideline, we
emphasize the use of eGFRcr-cys based on accumulatingevidence for its greater accuracy across populations and theuse of mGFR given the known residual errors in allestimating equations. We also describe laboratorytechniques and standards that satisfy the requirements forrobust result reporting. We encourage healthcare providersto have a clear understanding of the value and limitations
of both ﬁltration markers and mGFR, the importance of
standardization of assays for creatinine and cystatin C, and
quality control procedures for exogenous markers. Finally,we describe currently available, validated estimatingequations that can be used for the reporting of GFR byclinical laboratories.
1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR
Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR ”when referring
to the speci ﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use
the more general term “kidney function(s)” when dealing
with the totality of functions of the kidney.
The kidneys play several roles in the body, including
metabolism and excretion of substances, volume and BPregulation, erythropoietin production, and regulation ofelectrolytes, acid-base status, and mineral homeostasis.Glomerular ﬁltration is one of many functions of the kidney.
GFR is considered the best overall assessment of kidneyfunctions as, in general, losses of these other functions
correlate with the loss of GFR. The term “kidney function ”
reﬂects the entirety of different and complex physiological
functions of the kidney; thus, kidney function should not be a
term used interchangeably with GFR.
Assessment of the overall functions of the kidney is a
complex task. GFR is used as the primary tool to assess kidneyfunction in practice. Loss of other kidney functions areknown as complications of CKD and are addressed in
Chapter 3 . This section focuses on how GFR can be evaluated
using both mGFR and eGFR.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. There are numerous kidney dis-
orders in children that may present with tubular dysfunction
(e.g., Bartter ’s and Dent disease) rather than decreased GFRor albuminuria. These primarily result in polyuria and/orelectrolyte disturbances and may or may not progress toreduced GFR or kidney failure. Thus, the exclusive use of GFRin diagnosing CKD would not be of value in children, high-
lighting the importance of appreciating different markers
linked to different kidney functions.
1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers
We describe a framework for evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Tables 7 and8
127–142).
Figure 11 depicts an algorithm for evaluation of GFR from
initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decisions for when toperform supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR(Tables 7 and8). Healthcare providers should consider both
potential sources of error in eGFR as well as whether theclinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR whenconsidering the need for additional tests. The level ofaccuracy that is needed for a clinical decision for the use ofpotentially toxic medications, a medication with a narrowtherapeutic window, or for other therapies with potentialfor adverse events, may exceed the capability of any eGFRequation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed.
This assessment would ideally be performed every time a
GFR value is used to make a clinical decision.
Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and
an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR(Figure 11 ).
There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of
less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of
assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, esti-
mating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging,and monitoring the progression of CKD, and observationaldata documented an increase in CKD recognition and referralto nephrologists shortly after the implementation of reportingof eGFR by clinical laboratories, especially for females andelderly people.
143–145GFR is used in many routine and
complex clinical decisions as an assessment of excretory
kidney function ( Table 4 ) to detect and stage AKD and CKD,
determine CKD progression, dose medications, determine
appropriate use of diagnostic tests, and guide treatmentdecisions around KRT therapies. Equations are availablethat estimate GFR using SCr and adjusting for sex and age,and professional societies throughout the world haverecommended that GFR estimates should be used inassociation with SCr reporting. Sources of error in GFR
estimation from SCr concentration include non– steady-state
conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement
error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinineassays. GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levelsthan at lower levels, and healthcare providers should remainaware of caveats for any estimating equation that mayinﬂuence the accuracy in an individual person.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org
S176 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Most people with CKD and their healthcare providers would
prefer the more accurate assessment of kidney function resulting
from the use of GFR estimating equations compared with SCr
alone. Minimal cost or resources issues are expected because
creatinine is available in healthcare settings globally, and evalu-ating GFR with the use of creatinine in the form of GFR esti-mating equations has been recommended for >20 years.
eGFR from creatinine is widely used. Attention is required
to implement and ensure the quality of eGFR reporting byclinical laboratories and ensure coordination with the elec-tronic medical record (EMR), including those eGFR reports
from point-of-care settings (Section 1.2.2 ).Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using
eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is lessaccurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making
(Table 8
127-142)(1C).
This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of
GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in
clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequateassessment of GFR. There is consistent evidence that eGFRcr-cysprovides more accurate estimates of mGFR than eGFRcr andeGFRcys in ambulatory people.Initial test – eGFRcr*

Figure 11 | Approach to glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests. The algorithm describes the
approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a ﬁnal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in
individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most
people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a moreaccurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C –based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys
is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR shouldbe measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous ﬁltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or
eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in musclemass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speci ﬁc medications.

Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. Please see Practice Point
1.2.2.1 regarding the bene ﬁt of accurate assessment of GFR for
clinical decision-making. In clinical practice, there may be
situations where the estimation of GFR from SCr alone may
be a source of error, for example, muscle wasting/loss, or
where greater accuracy of GFR estimation is required forclinical decision-making (e.g., drug dosing). In most of thesesituations, estimating GFR using a combined creatinine andcystatin C equation provides the required degree of accuracyand obviates the need for expensive and time-consumingmeasurement of GFR using an approved gold standardmethodology. GFR estimating equations that incorporate both
creatinine and cystatin C have particular bene ﬁt in terms of
improved accuracy in relation to mGFR compared with
equivalent equations using only one of these markers.
91,92,146–149
In 2 large-scale studies in pooled cohorts of general pop-
ulation cohorts and clinical populations in North Americaand Europe, the P
30(deﬁned as the percentage of the eGFR
values within /C630% of mGFR) using eGFRcr-cys is in the
range of 90%,91,147which is considered optimal.1Greater
accuracy of eGFRcr-cys compared with eGFRcr or eGFRcysis also observed in studies evaluating GFR estimatingequations compared with mGFR in other countries such asBrazil, Congo, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan, and China, withP
30estimated between 80% and 90%,77,78,83,88,93,136,150–154
which is considered adequate for most decision-making.1
Potential harms include increased costs, as described
below, and greater complexity in the interpretation of GFR
with discrepant results between eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and
eGFRcr-cys. This in turn may lead to an increased number ofnephrology consults, especially initially as healthcare pro-viders may be unfamiliar with these new tests.
Certainty of evidence. The Work Group considered the
overall certainty of the evidence to be moderate to high inambulatory people who were neither frail nor had acute orchronic illnesses, and low in other populations due to in-consistencies and imprecision in the studies currently avail-able in the literature. Most of the studies used in thedevelopment and initial external validation of these equationswere performed in ambulatory people who were neither frailnor had acute or chronic illnesses. There remains a paucity ofstudies examining the accuracy of eGFR in such pop-ulations.
142Many studies that have been performed in such
populations are small, increasing risk for analyticalvariability, and show inconsistent results among the studieseven within the same disease. Some reports in populationswith cancer, HIV, or obesity demonstrate greater accuracyfor eGFRcr-cys than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys.
132–135,155–157
Consistent with these ﬁndings, a large study of people living
in Stockholm, Sweden referred for an mGFR test who haddiagnoses for heart failure, liver failure, cancer, CVD, or
diabetes found eGFRcr-cys to be the most accurate and
least biased.
82In other studies of sick or frail people, such
as very advanced liver or heart failure or those admitted tothe intensive care unit, all eGFR tests demonstrated verylow levels of accuracy.
73,137,158–161
There are insuf ﬁcient data to indicate the accuracy of
eGFRcr, eGFRcys, or eGFRcr-cys for many diseases. Forexample, in people with high cell turnover such as hematologic
cancers, we expect that cystatin C would provide highly inac-
curate estimates due to the increase in cystatin C because of cellturnover rather than decreased GFR disease.
162–165However,
there are no data to evaluate that hypothesis. Importantly, evenfor people from populations where eGFRcr-cys has beendemonstrated to be more accurate, healthcare providers shouldassess the potential sources of error in eGFR and the need for ahighly accurate level of GFR. Among people who are frail or
with multiple comorbid illnesses, eGFRcr-cys may be insuf ﬁ-
ciently accurate due to large contributions from non-GFR
determinants of creatinine, cystatin C, or both markers.Conversely, in otherwise healthy populations with decreasedTable 7 | Description of initial and supportive tests for the evaluation of GFR

creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased
creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use ofspeciﬁc medications, it is possible that eGFRcys rather than
eGFRcr-cys would be preferred.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most
people and most healthcare providers would want to use themost accurate assessment of GFR available to them andwould, therefore, wish to estimate GFR from a combinationof creatinine and cystatin C, when available. However, theywould also balance additional costs associated with cystatin Cagainst the potential bene ﬁts.
Differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys may prompt
recognition that both are estimates of GFR and both are asso-ciated with error, requiring interpretation as to the best esti-mate of GFR. In our view, this is desirable, and uncertainty as tothe level of GFR is an indication for nephrology referral.
Resource use and costs. Costs for the higher frequency of
cystatin C testing include one-time costs associated with initi-ation of the assay within a laboratory, which include buildingthe information technology infrastructure and method veri ﬁ-
cation studies, and continuous costs associated with main-taining the assay, which include reagents, daily quality control,requirements for calibration veri ﬁcation, and pro ﬁciency
testing. Reagent costs are currently more expensive thancreatinine but are lower compared with other commonly usedbiomarkers. If cystatin C is performed in an outside laboratory,other costs, as with any laboratory test, may ensue. Additionalcosts may also be a result of the increased referrals to ne-
phrologists to assist the interpretation of potentially discordant
results between eGFRcr and eGFRcys. Ideally, these decreaseover time with increased utilization.
Considerations for implementation. We recognize that for
these recommendations to be implemented, cystatin C needsto be widely available. Wherever possible, access to bothcreatinine and cystatin C measurements should be madeavailable when evaluating GFR. Education for healthcare
providers and people with CKD for optimal use and inter-
pretation of these tests is required. See Section 1.2.3 for details
regarding the measurement of creatinine and cystatin C byclinical laboratories.Rationale
We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous
ﬁltration marker that is now increasingly available. Its assay
can be put on autoanalyzers, and therefore its utilization couldbe increased with clinical demand. eGFRcr-cys provides the
most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary
supportive test for people in whom there are concerns abouteGFRcr accuracy ( Table 8
127–142). However, there remain
residual errors with some groups of people having a very highlevel of errors. In such people, we advocate using mGFR. Weanticipate that such considerations be made at every encounterwhere GFR is being used for a clinical decision.
Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment
of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR usingplasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous ﬁltration
marker ( Table 9).
Given the bene ﬁt of accurate assessment of GFR for clin-
ical decision-making, there is a need to appreciate the valueand circumstances in which directly mGFR is required. Thegreatest bene ﬁt of mGFR is that it is less in ﬂuenced by non-
GFR determinants, in contrast to eGFR. GFR is measuredusing exogenous ﬁltration markers and urinary or plasma
clearance. The precision of mGFR can be determined from
variability with repeated measures. Time-to-time variability is
the method used to assess error.
One systematic review summarizing the available data
comparing current GFR measurement methods to each otherand to the classic gold standard of inulin urinary clearance rec-ommended the use of iothalamate, iohexol, ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) as exogenous markers of choice.

subsequent study recommended against plasma99mTc-DTPA,
especially when clearances are performed over 2 –4h o u r s .167
Several studies demonstrate that the method by which theclearance of exogenous markers is measured may impactaccuracy. For example, for people with lower GFRs, delayedblood sampling is most accurate, whereas for people with

better-preserved GFRs, earlier blood sampling is most accurate,
and in people with extensive edema or ascites, plasma clearanceprotocols are very inaccurate and not recommended; instead,
urinary clearance protocols are recommended.
167Finally, it is
well recognized that assessing GFR using the imaging of
nuclear tracers is less accurate than eGFR, and we do notrecommend it as a method to measure GFR.
168
The evaluation of time-to-time variability of plasma
clearance of iohexol and eGFR found a within-subject bio-logical coef ﬁcient of variation (CV) for mGFR of 6.7% (95%
CI: 5.6% –8.2%), whereas CVs for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and
eGFRcr-cys were approximately 5.0%.
169Other studies have
observed CV for this same mGFR method ranging fromapproximately 5% to 10%.
169,170There are less data for
other methods; for urinary clearance of iothalamate,estimated CVs were 6.3% and 16.6% across 2 studies.
171–173
The Work Group judged that there will be some clinical
situations where estimating GFR from both creatinine andcystatin C will be insuf ﬁciently reliable or precise, and the
greatest bene ﬁt and least harm will be achieved by measuring
GFR with the appropriate standardized methods.
Costs for mGFR are variable and harder to quantify. The
infrastructure required is greater, as testing requires bothpatient and personnel time for inserting a peripheral intra-venous catheter, administering the exogenous marker, col-lecting serial blood specimens over several hours (dependingon the protocol), and the associated materials for the
collection and measuring blood levels by high-performance
liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Utilization ofmGFR may require input from a nephrologist in some set-tings, which would also add to the costs of testing.
All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at
least 1 method to measure GFRusing plasma or urinary clearanceof exogenous markers. T o ensure highly accurate measurements,these clearance methods should be performed using standard
operating procedures. External quality assessment (EQA) should
be used for assays of the exogenous markers. Special consider-ations in clearance methods are required for some populations toobtain a high level of accuracy (e.g., later sampling time forpeople with low GFR or urinary, instead of plasma clearance foredematous people). GFR centers, under the direction of anephrologist champion or laboratory director, analogous tocardiac imaging, are likely to help both increase utilization and
ensure high quality results. There will be additional requirements
for storage, administration, and disposal if radionuclide meth-odologies are adopted. National kidney societies can work withpayers to support reimbursement for mGFR procedures. TheEuropean Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) together withthe European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and LaboratoryMedicine is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol
plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures
for GFR measurements in the near future.
Decisions to measure GFR should be made by both ne-
phrologists and other physicians using the framework sug-gested in Figure 11 . Physicians should determine how accurate
the GFR needs to be for a speci ﬁc clinical decision. If greater
accuracy is needed than can be achieved using eGFR, mGFRis recommended. Greater accuracy may be required due to
inaccuracy of eGFR in the individual person due to the
presence of non-GFR determinants or due to the requirementof the clinical setting. Table 10 lists indications for when one
might consider mGFR as opposed to eGFRcr-cys.
We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginning
with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). mGFR is recommended when there are
concerns about the accuracy of eGFRcr-cys ( Table 8
127-142)o r
where an accurate level of GFR is required for optimaldecision-making, as described in Table 10 .
Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitationsin both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate
(mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in ﬂuence
SCr and cystatin C measurements.
All studies evaluating the performance of eGFR compared
with mGFR observe error in any GFR estimate. Even inpopulations where there is a high accuracy (i.e., P
30of 90%),
10% of the population would have errors $30% relative to
mGFR. Within these studies, error rates are likely to be higherin some subgroups and lower in others. A critical componentof the recommended approach to evaluation of GFR ( Figure
11) is that physicians have a clear understanding of the
value and limitations of eGFR and mGFR, which de ﬁnes
when a person requires one or another supportive test.
The source of error in eGFR may be related to errors in eGFR
or in mGFR ( Figure 12
174). The most important sources of error
are non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C. Thenon-GFR determinants of creatinine include generation by dietand muscle mass, tubular secretion, and extrarenalelimination.
130,175The non-GFR determinants of cystatin C
are less well understood but thought to be higher adiposity,
smoking, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess,
and chronic in ﬂammation (as indicated by insulin resistance,
higher levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor,or lower levels of serum albumin).
129,130,176–185Table 10 | Indications for measured GFR
Clinical conditions in which eGFRcr-cys is inaccurate or uncertain due to potential non-GFR determinants of creatinine and cystatin C. This may include
catabolic states, such as serious infections or in ﬂammatory states, high cell turnover as in some cancers, advanced cirrhosis or heart failure, use of high-
dose steroids, or the very frail. See Figure 12 for approach to individual decision-making.
Clinical settings in which greater accuracy is needed than is achieved with eGFRcr-cys. For example, decisions about simultaneous kidney transplan ta t
the time of other solid organ transplant, kidney donor candidacy, and drug dosing if there is a narrow therapeutic index or serious toxicity (e.g.,chemotherapies that are cleared by the kidney).

mGFR also differs from the true physiological GFR, which
itself cannot be directly measured. Errors may be related to
analytical errors in the assay or the clearance procedure. For
example, the overestimation of GFR is seen if late samples are
not taken for people with low GFR.167,186Urinary clearances
are preferred to plasma clearance methods in people withextensive third spacing of ﬂuid.
169–173In the absence of
changes related to disease progression, a change in mGFRfrom time to time may occur due to preanalytical (e.g.,patient preparation and time of day), analytical (laboratorymeasurement variability), and biological (changes in true
physiological GFR) variability, as is the case for eGFR. This
does not detract from the advantage of mGFR as being freefrom non-GFR determinants. It is important fornephrologists to appreciate and understand these errors andnuances to appropriately order the right tests in speci ﬁc
circumstances.
Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires
consideration of dietary intake.
Most studies measuring GFR for clinical or research pur-
poses are performed in the morning after a period of fasting or
moderate protein intake. Ideally, optimal application of eGFRwould simulate these conditions. Several studies havedocumented the impact of a cooked meat or ﬁsh meal on
creatinine concentrations.
187For example, one study
demonstrates increase in SCr of approximately 20 mmol/l
(0.23 mg/dl) which in the study population was equivalent todecrease in eGFR of approximately 20 ml/min per 1.73 m
2.
Maximum postprandial effects were reached in some subjectsby 2 hours and others by 4 hours. Waiting for at least 12hours before the measurement of SCr, after meat or ﬁsh
intake, best avoids this effect. We recognize that this approachmay be challenging to implement in the clinical environment.
Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in
eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.
When evaluating a change in eGFR over time, the question
is whether the true GFR is changing. However as describedabove, there are several other potential causes for a change inobserved eGFR, other than AKI, such as changes in non-GFRdeterminants of the ﬁltration markers or analytical errors in
the assays. Healthcare providers should consider whether
there has been a change in non-GFR determinants (e.g., a
recent meat meal now or at the ﬁrst measurement or change
in muscle mass or extreme activity). The impact of thecombined effect of analytical and biological variation oneGFR in determining progression is discussed in Chapter 2.

Figure 12 | Sources and magnitude of error around measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR). It is
important to determine how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for clinical decision-making. P 30for eGFR refers to the percent of
eGFRs that are within 30% of mGFR. If accuracy within 30% is acceptable (P 30>80%) or optimal (P 30>90%), eGFR may be suf ﬁcient, provided
that there are not large deviations in non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C. If greater accuracy is needed, mGFR is advised. The
accuracy for mGFR is based on time-to-time variability. P 15for mGFR refers to the percent of one mGFR that was within 15% of the second. At a
GFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 42 to 78 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to
51 to 69 ml/min per 1.73 m2. At a GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 21 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15%
accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 26 to 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Non-GFR determinants of endogenous ﬁltration markers include generation,
tubular handling, and extrarenal elimination. Nonideal properties of exogenous ﬁltration markers include tabular handling and extrarenal
elimination. Reproduced from Kidney International , volume 96, issue 2, Inker LA, Levey AS. Knowing your GFR —when is the number not (exactly)

When evaluating a change in GFR using mGFR, the com-
bined effect of changes in biological and analytical variationshould be considered as part of the interpretation of the re-sults ( Figure 12
174).169
Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C –based
estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some
speciﬁc circumstances.
The combination of eGFRcr and eGFRcys together is more
accurate than eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone.91,147The greater
accuracy is due to the fact that the non-GFR determinantsfor each marker are different, and therefore using both
leads to convergence on the estimate of GFR and minimizes
the effect of either marker.
188
In individuals where non-GFR determinants of creatinine
or cystatin C are substantially greater than for the othermarker, eGFRcr-cys would not provide the more accurateestimate. This imbalance is more likely to occur for creati-nine, given its association with diet and muscle mass, whichcan vary greatly across various people. In such cases, it would
be reasonable to use eGFRcys.
The non-GFR determinants for cystatin C are less well
studied, and it is erroneous to assume that eGFRcys provides
the more accurate estimate in all circumstances. We, there-fore, advise limiting this strategy to selected clinical settingswhere people are otherwise healthy with known changes innon-GFR determinants of creatinine. For example, in 1 studythat compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys before and after ampu-
tation in otherwise healthy military veterans, there was a
sizable change in eGFRcr as would be expected with the lossof a limb and loss of mobility, but no change in eGFRcys.
128
In another study of people with anorexia, serum levels ofcystatin C were more strongly correlated with mGFR thanwere levels of SCr, but this has not been further evaluatedusing eGFR and standardized assays.
127Other situations
may be where there are medications that inhibit tubular
secretion of creatinine, although there are no studies to
provide evidence to drive guidance.
Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of dif-
ferences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may beinformative, in both direction and magnitude of thosedifferences.
For people who have simultaneous SCr and cystatin C
values, the agreement or discrepancy between eGFRcr andeGFRcys may help to guide further actions. Several studieshave demonstrated that 25% –30% of people have discordance
between eGFRcr and eGFRcys as large as or larger than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m
2or$20%.82,138,189One study demonstrated
that factors associated with higher values for eGFRcrcompared with eGFRcys included older age, female sex,non–Black race, higher eGFR, higher BMI, weight loss, and
current smoking.
190Two recent studies demonstrate that
when there is concordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys,there is high and similar accuracy for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, andeGFRcr-cys with estimated P
30of 87% –91%.82,138,189Incontrast, when there is discordance, eGFRcr-cys is moreaccurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. This suggests thatwhen eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, it is reasonableto continue to measure cystatin C serially in addition to
creatinine in those settings where GFR will affect clinical
decisions. It is also reasonable to consider performing/conducting mGFR when using medications with narrowtherapeutic index or high toxicity or to inform criticaltreatment decisions (Chapter 4 ).
Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections formeasured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and
eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate.
mGFR is not available everywhere. In these settings, it
might be reasonable to consider measured urinary creatinine
clearance (CrCl). It is widely available and thereforecommonly used but is highly prone to error due to under- orovercollection. A systematic review of GFR methods observeda mean bias of 25% across 23 studies, and as such, did notﬁnd this method to reach suf ﬁcient accuracy.
166The errors
occur in both directions and thus do not appear solely dueto the presence of tubular secretion of creatinine, whichwould be expected to overestimate mGFR. For example, inthe pilot study for the African American Study of KidneyDisease (AASK), 25% of participants had a 24-hourmeasured CrCl that was at least 18% lower than the mGFR,and another 25% had measured CrCl at least 23% greaterthan the GFR. Of note, measured CrCl had substantially
better correlation with mGFR when it was measured during
an mGFR procedure
191; therefore, if measured CrCl is to be
performed, then it should ideally be supervised given thehigh risk of inaccuracy with urine collection.
Special considerations
Sex and gender considerations. It is unclear how best to
estimate GFR in people who are transgender, gender-diverse,
or nonbinary, where a person ’s gender identity is different
from their sex assigned at birth. Gender-af ﬁrming testos-
terone therapy is associated with an increase in SCr concen-
tration,192with less certainty for the impact of estrogen.
Gender-af ﬁrming testosterone therapy is associated with an
increase in serum cystatin C and gender-af ﬁrming estradiol,
and antiandrogen therapy is associated with a decrease inserum cystatin C.
193The impact of gender-af ﬁrming
hormone therapy, if any, on true GFR is unknown. Inkeeping with guidance from the American Association ofClinical Chemistry and the National Kidney Foundation,
194
evaluation of eGFR should use a shared decision-makingapproach with the person with CKD, taking into accountmuscle mass, sex hormone milieu, sex assigned at birth,and gender identity. We also note that the new EKFCcystatin equation does not include a variable for sex.
Pediatric considerations. There are currently insuf ﬁcient
externally validated data to assess if combining creatinine andcystatin improves the performance of pediatric eGFR equa-tions. Internal analysis of the Chronic Kidney Disease inwww.kidney-international.org chapter 1
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S183
Children (CKiD) cohort revealed that averaging the eGFRcr
and eGFRcys reduced mean bias in people who are Black,White, and other race. Likewise, averaging eGFRs derivedfrom the equations improved accuracy to 89% –91% (as
assessed by P
30) across race groups. This has not been
externally validated.195
1.2.3 Guidance to clinical laboratories
Practice Point 1.2.3.1: Implement the laboratory standardsof care outlined in Table 11 to ensure accuracy and
reliability when assessing GFR using creatinine andcystatin C.
Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical
laboratories may consider the possibility of measurementof both creatinine and cystatin either as an in-house test oras a referred test.
Consistency, standardization, and comparability of labo-
ratory measures of creatinine and cystatin C; the reporting ofresults and of GFR estimates; and the ﬂagging of reported
results where indicated are of paramount importance. Theassays used should have the required speci ﬁcity for the ana-
lyte, and the calibration of assays is essential for the inter-pretation of kidney function measures. Results should betraceable to reference materials and methods listed on theJoint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine(JCTLM) database.
Estimation of GFR improves identi ﬁcation of CKD.
Adoption of the laboratory standards described here willensure that healthcare providers receive eGFR reports in aconsistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracyand reliability of the result. Flagging decreased values foreGFR can alert healthcare providers to the possibility ofkidney disease and may indicate the need for additionalevaluation or adjustment of doses of medications that areexcreted by the kidney.
Globally, most creatinine measurements are undertaken
using a colorimetric method (Jaffe). This method also reactswith a variety of substances that are not creatinine (so-called“non-creatinine chromogens, ”e.g., glucose and acetoacetate),typically comprising some 20% of the measured substancereported as creatinine in adults at physiological creatinineconcentrations. Enzymatic assays are available that are morespeciﬁc for creatinine and less susceptible to chemical and
chromogenic (e.g., icterus and hemolysis) interferences.Although enzymatic methods are not totally immune to theinterferences affecting the Jaffe method and may be suscep-tible to other interferences speci ﬁc to the enzymatic approach,
in the majority of people, use of an enzymatic method willreduce the possibility of interference ( Table 12
127,196–215). It is
likely that cystatin C measurements will be less susceptible tochemical and spectral interferences affecting creatinine assays,but inevitably, interferences will surface with more extensiveclinical experience, for example, those due to circulatingantibodies that are seen with other immunoassays.
216–218
After venipuncture, in unseparated samples, there is a
gradual increase in measured SCr over time when the Jaffeassay is used. This effect is not seen when enzymatic assays areTable 11 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of GFR assessments using creatinine and cystatin C

The nature of interference (magnitude and direction of bias) from the listed com-
pounds is dependent on the precise reaction conditions in use, in relation to timingof spectrophotometric readings and chemical composition of the reagent: different
versions of the Jaffe and enzymatic methods used by different manufacturers will
respond in variable ways to interferences. Further information may be found in

used.219We therefore advise that serum should be removed
from the red blood cells within 12 hours of venipuncture
when the Jaffe assay is being used.
As described in Section 1.2, eGFR is an imperfect estimate
of mGFR. At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% ofmGFR. As shown in Figure 12 , one of the sources of error
is analytical variability in measurement of the ﬁltration
markers. Optimization of laboratory measurements ofcreatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertaintyinherent in GFR estimation. The components ofmeasurement error that laboratories must address areaccuracy (trueness of the result), imprecision (analytical
variability of the result, commonly expressed as a CV), and
speciﬁcity (reduction of interferences in the measurement).
The availability of international reference standards for bothcreatinine
220and cystatin C221and demonstration that the
laboratory results have minimal bias compared with thesehelp to ensure the accuracy of results. Imprecision targetsare commonly based on the known biological variability ofbiomarkers (https://biologicalvariation.eu/ ). Analytical
variability that is less than half the within-person biologicalvariability is generally considered desirable.
222The target
CVs proposed here for creatinine and cystatin C should beachievable by automated laboratory methods. Achieving thetarget precision and bias goals proposed will ensure thatlaboratory error contributes to a less than 10% increase inroot mean square error when estimating GFR.
205
Most people with CKD, healthcare providers, and policy
makers would want laboratories to implement calibrated as-says for creatinine and cystatin C that comply with interna-tional standards and use reagents for analysis that conform tointernationally approved reference materials. Compliancewith the recommended standards would ensure con ﬁdence in
the results and in clinical decisions and any changes inmanagement and treatment made as a consequence.
Globally, most GFR estimates are currently produced using
creatinine results generated by Jaffe assays, which are rela-tively inexpensive. Use of more speci ﬁc enzymatic creatinine
assays can improve the estimation of GFR. However, enzy-matic creatinine assays are more expensive than Jaffe assays.Use of cystatin C in combined creatinine-cystatin C GFRequations can also further improve GFR estimation, butcystatin C measurement adds signi ﬁcantly to the cost.
Although the per-patient cost increase of enzymatic creatinine
and cystatin C measurement is relatively small, the imple-
mentation of these more expensive approaches has signi ﬁcant
cost implications across entire healthcare systems.
Implementation considerations include the following:
Creatinine. Resource limitations that may restrict access to
enzymatic creatinine should not be seen as a barrier toimplementation of a GFR reporting program based on Jaffecreatinine measurement.
Cystatin C. Ideally, cystatin C will be available for timely
same-day results, which requires either measurement withinthe local laboratory or alternatively as a referred test incentralized laboratories. A range of commercially availableroutine clinical biochemistry analyzers from a variety ofmanufacturers can support cystatin C assays and will allow
turnaround time for results as rapid as that for routine
electrolytes and creatinine when provided locally. Timelinesswill affect utilization (i.e., if results are available on the sameday), then the test is more likely to be useful for routine orurgent decisions, and this may increase the pressure on lab-oratories to provide this test locally.
Estimated GFR. Implementation and modi ﬁcation (e.g., a
change in equation) of GFR estimation require close
communication between the laboratory and a range of clinical
users, including primary and secondary care healthcare pro-viders, pharmacists, dietitians, and people with CKD.
223
Laboratories should only use GFR estimating equations thathave been suf ﬁciently validated in the population to which
they are being applied and that are appropriate for thecreatinine and cystatin C assays in use (Section 1.2.4 ).
223
They should also ensure that their end-to-end reporting
processes, including calculations embedded within the
laboratory information system, are subject to regular EQA.Laboratory reports for computed values should indicate theﬁltration marker (i.e., eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and eGFRcr-cys).Documentation should indicate which equation was used.
To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare
systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number ofmeaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach in
relation to reporting units of GFR, creatinine, and cystatin C
should be implemented. Input age may be rounded to wholenumbers or as a fractional year because the in ﬂuence on
eGFR is small. To adjust GFR for differences in body size,mGFR is commonly adjusted for body surface area (BSA),with a population average BSA value of 1.73 m
2being used. In
practice, eGFR values derived using most equations arealready adjusted for BSA, because BSA was taken into account
when the equations were originally developed using regres-
sion modeling against BSA-adjusted mGFR.
eGFR is mostly computed using the information recorded
in the sex variable in EMRs. Some EMRs include legal sex, sexassigned at birth, and gender identity, whereas others includeonly one variable. In some cases, this variable may be missingor reported as nonbinary. In these cases, eGFR values cannotbe computed and will be displayed as a missing value. Lab-
oratories should add a comment directing healthcare pro-
viders and people with CKD to online calculators to facilitatea shared decision-making approach to the person with CKD.The comment may also include a suggestion to use cystatin Cas there is less difference between eGFRcys values for malesand females and where there is now an option for computingeGFR without the use of sex.
Together, the set of statements allow for a consistent
approach to the measurement and reporting of serum ﬁltra-
tion markers and eGFR in clinical practice.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1

Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in
infants or small children must ensure their quality controlprocess include the lowest end of the expected range ofvalues for the group of interest.
Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of
enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher
relative contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to
measured creatinine in children when using the Jaffe assay,and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samplesin the neonatal period.
Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per
1.73 m
2can be ﬂagged as “low”in children and adolescents
over the age of 2 years.
In the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the
Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease,1a
cutoff of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2was chosen to de ﬁne“low”
GFR for children. In this update, we advise increasing the
cutoff to 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2for children and adolescents.
In children and adolescents, a reduced GFR is likely to
deteriorate further and, therefore, warrants closer monitoringand early intervention. Children with lower-than-normal GFRoften experience deterioration in GFR during periods of rapidgrowth in adolescence.
224Those with subnormal GFR during
adolescence are more likely to eventually experience clinicallyimportant low GFR later in life. Even mild decreases ineGFR (i.e., CKD G2) are associated with poor kidneyoutcomes. In a US study of over 7 million children captured
by electronic health record data, 8600 had CKD G2. At 10
years from cohort entry, the rate of reaching kidney failureor a 50% decline in eGFR ranged from around 10%(nonglomerular CKD) to around 40% (glomerular CKD).
225
Furthermore, eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2
is sometimes associated with impaired linear growth andwith hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents.
226,227
A higher cutoff de ﬁning low GFR for children and ado-
lescents also re ﬂects their longer life expectancy. Early inter-
vention may have profound protection of GFR. CKD G2 haslong been considered to re ﬂect decreased GFR in children,
reﬂected by the inclusion of children and adolescents with
CKD G2 in pediatric CKD trials and cohort studies, includingEffect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition onthe Progression of CRF in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE),
228
Hypertension Optimal Treatment in Children with Chronic
Kidney Disease (HOT-KIDS; United Kingdom),229CKiD
(North America),230KoreaN cohort study for outcomes in
people with pediatric CKD (KNOW-PedCKD; South
Korea),231and the Kids with CKD (KCAD; Australia and
New Zealand).232The de ﬁnition of CKD remains
unchanged; the ﬂagging of GFR <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2as
low for children and adolescents re ﬂects the need for closer
assessment for evidence of kidney damage and monitoring.1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations
Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a
validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR
from serum ﬁltration markers (eGFR) rather than
relying on the serum ﬁltration markers alone (1D).
Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within
geographical regions (as de ﬁned locally [e.g., continent,
country, and region] and as large as possible). Within such
regions, equations may differ for adults and children.
The recommendation places a high value on the use of an
estimating equation for GFR that has been validated in the
population of interest and which has been shown to be most
accurate in comparison with mGFR and a low value on the
comparison of performance characteristics across differentequations. The key points are to use an equation validated inand most suited to the population of interest.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. This recommendation rec-
ognizes that there are now a number of validated GFR esti-mating equations available. They have differing performance
characteristics, which may differ depending on the population
of interest. The intention of suggesting the use of the sameequation within a region is to reduce clinical confusion ifpeople with CKD go to different laboratories within a regionand to enable appropriate population comparisons. Use ofdifferent equations (and thus different eGFR values for thesame person) may lead to confusion for both the individualperson and their healthcare providers.
The Work Group judged that there is potential for harm if
people get different eGFR values when receiving care indifferent settings. As described in Section 1.2.2 ,t h e r ea r e
several sources of variability in eGFR. Differences betweenvalid equations are often substantially less than these sourcesof variability, but that might not be understood by mosthealthcare providers or people, leading to excessive anxietyand repeated testing for small changes in GFR as related to
the use of a different GFR estimating equation. Using the
same equation within the same geographical region caneliminate the source of variation that is related to the speci ﬁc
parameters of the GFR estimating equation.
There is bene ﬁt to clinical care, research, and public health
with the use of validated equations such that decisions,research ﬁndings, and public policy are informed by accurate
estimates of CKD.
Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on
Work Group consensus regarding good clinical practice to usea GFR estimating equation validated in the population ofinterest. Table 13 lists criteria for validated equations.
The criteria were developed by accumulated evidence from
assessment of the performance of eGFR versus mGFR acrossequations and populations. For example, use of equationsdeveloped using assays that are not traceable to referencechapter 1 www.kidney-international.org
S186 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
materials cannot be applied to settings with differences in
assays,233or use of equations developed in one population
may not perform well in other populations with verydifferent characteristics.
153,234,235
Values and preferences. There are now several valid equa-
tions that can be reasonably used in local settings. The WorkGroup recognizes that different values and preferences maylead to different decisions in selection among validated GFR
estimating equations. Thus, instead of being prescriptive, we
list a set of criteria that de ﬁnes a valid equation, a set of
equations considered valid at this time, and a list of metrics todeﬁne better versus worse performance as evaluated in the
local area. It is of value that GFR thresholds for de ﬁnition and
staging be standardized using valid equations optimized for aspeciﬁc region helps to ensure this occurs. Where possible,
inclusion of representation from key constituents in the
population in the development of the equation and ensuring
that it remains valid in those populations is also of value.
Using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy of
assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no singleequation performs consistently across all populations. The WorkGroup judged that people with CKD and their healthcare pro-viders would want GFR estimated using the equation providingthe greatest accuracy in the population of their geographical
region. The Work Group recognizes that across the world there is
signiﬁcant variation in the sociodemographic and ethnic
makeup of populations and that even well-validated equationsdeveloped in different populations may not perform as well asothers developed and validated in the population of interest.
Resource use and costs. There are a number of initial costs
including human resource costs associated with taking the timeto decide on which equation, then time and technical infor-
mation resources to be considered to change the computation,
and the laboratory and nephrology teams to test the newequation and inform the clinical partners on the change. Inaddition, education for primary care providers, people withCKD, and other healthcare providers is also required, whichincurs both direct and indirect costs. There will be costs, bothhuman resource and meetings costs, associated with decision-making around which equation to use. Additional costs will beaccrued if validation and impact studies are required.
Considerations for implementation. Each region should have
a mechanism for review and selection of equations forimplementation by laboratories. For most countries, this
might be through the national kidney society working in
collaboration with laboratory physician organizations orregional laboratory groups, as has occurred in the UnitedStates and Europe, respectively.
236,237Decisions at this level by
continental or national organizations are likely to minimizethe likelihood that decisions for equation use will be madewithin small geographical areas or governed by localdecisions, leading to greater variation in eGFR and
uncertainty by people with CKD and healthcare providers.
Considerations in decisions about implementation willreﬂect the balance of the criteria listed in Table 13 .
There are likely to be tradeoffs between optimal accuracy
in local regions versus uniformity. Equations optimized for aspeciﬁc region can help to ensure that the GFR thresholds for
disease de ﬁnition, classi ﬁcation, and risk estimation have the
same implications across regions. However, it would lead to
barriers to implementation, as it will not be possible for all
regions to conduct a suf ﬁciently large and representative
study to evaluate these equations and develop modi ﬁcations.
If not possible, or in the interim, we advise using equationsthat were developed in populations most similar to theavailable populations. For example, until more accurate re-gion-speci ﬁc equations are available in countries within
Central or South America, it may be reasonable to use CKD-
EPI given the inclusion of Black and Hispanic participants in
the development of equation, and within African countries, touse the EKFC equations using the Q-values, the median SCrconcentration in a cohort developed in 2 African countries.

However, other considerations may also be relevant for the
regional organization making these decisions. We also notethat if cystatin C is available, then using eGFRcr-cys wouldsimplify the selection of the equation as the performance of
eGFRcr-cys computed from the different equations is more
similar than that of eGFRcr.
Rationale
The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu-ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease recom-mended “to report eGFRcr in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI
creatinine equation. An alternative creatinine-based GFR
estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown to
improve accuracy of GFR estimates compared to the 2009CKD-EPI creatinine equation. ”We are updating this recom-
mendation to accommodate the availability of alternativeequations that also have high levels of accuracy. Since thepublication of the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guidelinefor the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-ease
1for GFR estimation in adults, there have been 3 main
sources of validated equations: those developed by theCKD-EPI, those developed by EKFC, and modi ﬁcations of
each for use in speci ﬁc regions ( Table 14
83,91,147,148,235,238–
243).Table 15 lists thresholds for key performance metrics
that can be used to guide comparison between equations.
The CKD-EPI Research Group developed equations for
estimating GFR from creatinine, cystatin C, and the combinationof both, with and without inclusion of a coef ﬁcient for Black
race. The concerns about the continued use of race in GFR thatled to the removal of the race coef ﬁcient are described in the
rationale that follows Practice Point 1.2.4.2. The 2009 CKD-EPIcreatinine equation includes creatinine, age, race, and sex.
238The
2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation was re ﬁtted without race and
includes creatinine, age, and sex.147As a consequence of not
including the Black race coef ﬁcient, the 2021 CKD-EPI
creatinine equation leads to a small overestimate of GFR in
non-Black individuals and a small underestimate in Black
individuals. The 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is moreaccurate than the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation in thenon-Black race group, as indicated by the percentage of eGFRswithin 30% of mGFR (P
30), although the change in the level of
accuracy is small compared with the known variability inmGFR and eGFR, and P
30remains at the level consistent with
recommended targets as indicated in prior CKD guidelines
(Table 1483,91,147,148,235,238– 243Section 1.2.2, Figure 12174).1,147
The 2021 CKD-EPI eGFR creatinine-cystatin C equation that
includes both ﬁltration markers but does not include a term
for Black race leads to improved accuracy in both race groups,with less difference between race groups in all metrics. TheEKFC developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinineand cystatin C.
91,240Before implementation in other regions,
the authors recommended that local regions specify
population-speci ﬁc Q-values for the creatinine-based EKFC
equation, which is the normal level of creatinine in that region.
T o make the SCr-based EKFC equation applicable for children,age-adjusted Q-values were de ﬁned. The original EKFCcreatinine equation had a Q-value developed from Belgiumand Sweden but was validated in 7 European studies and isrecommended for use in White Europeans.
240They have
recently published Q-values for Black Europeans developed
from a cohort of 90 kidney donors in Paris and for Black
Africans developed from 2 cohorts in RépubliqueDémocratique de Congo Cote D ’Ivoire. The EKFC cystatin C
equation includes only age and cystatin C, that is, it does notinclude sex or race. The Q-value for cystatin C was developedin a White cohort in Uppsala, Sweden. The cystatin C –based
EKFC equation has been validated in White Europeans, BlackEuropeans, White Americans, and Black Africans. T o increase
accuracy and precision, EKFC recommends averaging
creatinine and cystatin C to obtain an estimate of GFR thatincludes both ﬁltration markers. eGFRcr-cys (the average of
the EKFC creatinine and EKFC cystatin C) also provides themost accurate estimates, consistent with the ﬁndings of CKD-
EPI eGFRcr-cys.
In both the CKD-EPI and EKFC external validation data-
sets, there are consistent ﬁndings that the eGFRcr-cys provides
improved performance in estimating mGFR compared withthe respective creatinine- or cystatin-only equations. This re-inforces the recommendation in Section 1.2.1 emphasizing the
greater use of eGFRcr-cys for decisions that require GFR.
There have been several modi ﬁcations to the CKD-EPI
equations for use in individual countries, including China, Japan,and Pakistan.
83,153,235We expect country-speci ﬁcm o d i ﬁcations
of both CKD-EPI and EKFC to continue to be developed. One
recent study in China reported no clinically meaningful
difference in the performance of the Asian-modi ﬁed CKD-EPI
and EKFC equations compared with mGFR.244
Studies vary in their consistency and precision. Direct
comparisons of available estimating equations in populationswith worldwide applicability are lacking, and so too arevalidation studies comparing equations against mGFR in allpopulations of interest. The overall certainty of the evidence is
therefore low but where the performance characteristics of
GFR estimating equations in the population of interest areknown, there are data to support the use of one equation overanother for improved accuracy of GFR reporting.
Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of
eGFR should be avoided.
Estimating equations for GFR have historically incorpo-
rated demographic variables of age, sex, and race to explainvariation in serum concentrations of endogenous ﬁltration
markers that are unrelated to GFR, thereby minimizing sys-tematic errors in subgroups de ﬁned by these variables and
systematic differences between groups.
Age, sex, and race variables were included in the 2009
CKD-EPI equation as previous studies indicated higheraverage SCr for the same mGFR level in people who are older
versus younger, males versus females, and people who are
Black versus non-Black. Incorporation of these variablesminimized systematic errors in groups and systematic dif-ferences between groups.

Race differs from age and sex, as race (and ethnicity) is dy-
namic, shaped by geographic, cultural, and sociopolitical forces,and thus the de ﬁnition can change across geography and over
time.
246,247Consistent with this, in the past several years,
inclusion of race in GFR estimating equations, along withother algorithms in medicine, faced increasing scrutiny,particularly in the United States but also elsewhere in theworld.
248–254Concerns included, ﬁrst, race is a social and not a
biological construct, and thus the de ﬁnition of a race group is
subject to change over time. Second, using a binary variable toassign race groups ignores social and biological diversity withinand among people with similar racial background groups.Third, there are differences across countries and regions inself-reported race and ethnicity, thus leading to uncertainty asto how to apply the term, and blanket use can lead to error.
Thus, even though the inclusion of an indicator for race
group leads to improved accuracy compared with mGFR in
some studies, these concerns and other considerations led to the
2021 recommendation for it not to be used in the computationof eGFR in the United States.
255Other countries have also
recognized that race should not be included in computationand elected to use the CKD-EPI 2009 age, sex, race –non-
Black, as the population of people who are Black wassufﬁciently small to not warrant error for other groups.
236,256
We recognize that speci ﬁc countries or regions (e.g., Japan
and Thailand) have developed “region-speci ﬁc”equations.153
We advocate for modifying equations based on the populationbeing tested.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children usingvalidated equations that have been developed or validatedin comparable populations.Examples of validated equations include the CKiD under 25
years old (U25) 2021 eGFRcr equation, the EKFC, and theCKD-EPI40. The Work Group judged that many healthcareproviders would choose the CKiD U25 2021 eGFRcr equation
given it was derived in a multiracial cohort of children with
CKD and has been externally validated in cohorts with reducedand normal GFR. The performance of the CKiD U25 2021eGFRcr equation is uncertain in the very young, those with verylow GFR, or in populations outside of Europe and NorthAmerica.
257An alternative height/sex/age/creatinine-based
GFR estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown toimprove accuracy of GFR estimates in the population of
interest ( Table 14
83,91,147,148,235,238–243). The EKFC equation
has been validated in a large cohort of European children (N
¼1254), as well as in adults.240Of interest, the EKFC
equation in children is the same as in adults. Thus, bothCKiD U25 and EKFC allow a GFR estimation for childrenwith CKD without changes in calculated eGFR at thetransition between adolescence and young adulthood. Inchildren with neurological disorders, muscle wasting, or who
have metabolic disorders and are on a very low –protein diet,
a cystatin C –based equation is likely more appropriate.
1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria
Albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine
(urine ACR $30 mg/g or $3 mg/mmol). Albumin is one type
of plasma protein found in the urine in normal subjects andin larger quantity in people with kidney disease. In the KDIGO2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation andManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease,
1clinical terminology
was changed to focus on albuminuria rather than proteinuriaas albumin is the principal component of urinary protein in
most kidney diseases. Epidemiologic data demonstrate a strong
relationship between the quantity of urine albumin with bothkidney and CVD risk and observed CVD even at very lowlevels, and assays to measure albumin are more precise andsensitive than assays to measure urine protein. We refer toalbuminuria or urine albumin when discussing generalconcepts and will refer either to total protein, albumin, or otherspeciﬁc proteins when discussing that parameter speci ﬁcally.
1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers
Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for
initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of prefer-
ence). In all cases, a ﬁrst void in the morning midstream
sample is preferred in adults and children.
(i)urine ACR, or
(ii)reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR withautomated reading.
If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements:
(i)urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR),
(ii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with auto-mated reading, or
(iii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein withmanual reading.Table 15 | Criteria for equation comparison for comparison of

S190 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when
albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods.
/C15Conﬁrm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or pro-
teinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement andexpress as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible(i.e., quantify the ACR or PCR if initial semiquantitativetests are positive).
/C15Conﬁrm ACR ‡30 mg/g ( ‡3 mg/mmol) on a random
untimed urine with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void in
the morning midstream urine sample.
Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affectinterpretation of measurements of urine albumin andurine creatinine and order con ﬁrmatory tests as indicated
(Table 16 ).
The practice point advocating for the use of spot samples
measuring albumin or protein greatly facilitates its incorpo-ration into clinical practice by avoiding the need for timedurine collections. Such spot samples can over- or underesti-mate urine albumin due to variation in dilution. Use of ACRor protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) in spot urine samplescan decrease this error. ACR is an estimate of total urine al-bumin loss. The creatinine excretion rate varies substantially
between people. ACR or PCR will overestimate urine albumin
loss in people with low creatinine excretion and will under-estimate urine albumin or protein loss in people with veryhigh creatinine excretion.
The decision by prior guideline Work Groups not to have a
sex-speci ﬁc threshold and to use easy-to-remember values
regardless of units may also lead to some misclassi ﬁcation. On
balance, the current Work Group agrees with this approach
given the continued underutilization of urine albumin in the
assessment of CKD.
It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measure-
ment with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric(effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to bemissed. The signi ﬁcance of this issue is thought to be low in
adults.
258–261
In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24
hours) are lost in the urine. Urine albumin measurementprovides a more speci ﬁc and sensitive measure of changes in
glomerular permeability than urinary total protein.
262–264
There is evidence that urinary albumin is a more sensitive testto enable the detection of glomerular pathology associatedwith some other systemic diseases including diabetes, hy-pertension, and systemic sclerosis.
265–268
T otal protein measurement is problematic in urine due to
imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations —relatively
large increases in urine albumin loss can occur without causing asigniﬁcant measurable increase in urinary total protein,
264large
sample-to-sample variation in the amount and composition ofproteins, high and variable concentrations of non –protein
interfering substances relative to the protein concentration,and high inorganic ion content. Most laboratories currentlyuse either turbidimetry or colorimetry
269to measure total
protein. These methods do not give equal analytical speci ﬁcity
and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency269–271to react
more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other
non-albumin proteins,272–275and many have signi ﬁcant
interferences causing falsely high results.275–277There is no
reference measurement procedure and no standardized
reference material for urinary total protein measurement(https://jctlm.org/ ). The variety of methods and calibrants in
use means that there is inevitably signi ﬁcant between-
laboratory variation.
278–280
Studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of tests to
quantify urine albumin and other proteins usually comparetests with laboratory quanti ﬁcation from 24-hour urine col-
lections. It is generally recognized that a 24-hour sample is thedeﬁnitive means of demonstrating the presence ofTable 16 | Factors causing biological variation in urine albumin or urine protein

albuminuria. However, timed samples are often collected with
error. Overnight, ﬁrst void in the morning, second void in the
morning, or random sample collections are therefore rec-ommended as ﬁrst-line tests.
281,282Because creatinine
excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allowscorrection for variations in urinary concentration.
283,284
ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement of urinealbumin loss.
285–290PCR on random or early morning
untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance andcorrelation with 24-hour collection.
281,291–298
We acknowledge that reagent strip devices can have a role
in settings where access to laboratory services may be limited(see Section 1.4).
Implementation of ﬁrst morning voids will be dif ﬁcult to
obtain in most healthcare settings. Nephrology of ﬁces could
develop protocols to send people with CKD home with aurine collection container and instruction on how to obtain aclean catch, which the person brings back before their nextvisit. Alternatively, obtaining blood and urine tests before the
next visit can facilitate ﬁrst morning voids. However, in the
absence of a ﬁrst morning void, a random sample may still be
used. Negative ﬁndings in people at high risk for CKD, for
example, where the urine sample is diluted, can be con ﬁrmed
with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void. Positive ﬁndings in
people at low risk for CKD, where the ACR level is just above
the threshold where the urine samples are concentrated, canalso be con ﬁrmed with a ﬁrst morning void.
The numeric equivalence of ACR in mg/g (mg/mmol) to
approximately g/d is based on the simple assumption thatcreatinine excretion rate (CER) approximates 1 gram/d (10mmol/d). T o better estimate urine albumin in individuals withcreatinine generation that is very different from the average, onemight consider measuring a timed urine collection if the valuewould affect clinical decisions. As with assessment of GFR usingmeasured CrCl, use supervised urine collections. Alternatively,
equations are available that estimate creatinine generation from
prediction equations and then multiply that value by the ACR tocompute an estimated albumin excretion rate (AER) that ac-commodates the lower or higher level of CER.
299,300
Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended because
it is relatively standardized and because it is the single mostimportant protein lost in the urine in most CKDs. Use ofurinary albumin measurement as the preferred test for pro-
teinuria detection will improve the sensitivity, quality, and
consistency of approach to the early detection and manage-ment of kidney disease.
Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total
protein are insuf ﬁciently sensitive for the reliable detection of
proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and areonly semiquantitative. Furthermore, there is no standardizationbetween manufacturers. The use of such strips should be
discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements
of albuminuria or proteinuria, or validated point-of-care de-vices for urine albumin/ACR (Section 1.4). When used, reagent
strip results should be con ﬁrmed by laboratory testing.Although the reference point remains the accurately timed
24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a dif ﬁcult
procedure to control effectively and that inaccuracies in urinarycollection may contribute to errors in estimation of albumin
and/or protein losses. In practice, untimed urine samples are a
reasonable ﬁrst test for ascertainment of albuminuria. A ﬁrst
morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion, has relatively lowintraindividual variability, and is required to exclude thediagnosis of orthostatic (postural) proteinuria. A random urinesample is acceptable if no ﬁrst morning void sample is available.
The concentration of albumin or protein in a urine sample will
be affected by hydration (i.e., how diluted or concentrated a
urine sample is), and reporting the albumin or protein to thecreatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration andreduce intraindividual variability.
205,261,301,302
There is biological and analytical variability in urine albu-
min and urine protein loss. There are several biological factorsthat affect urine albumin or protein loss, separate from kidneydisease ( Table 16 ).
259All of these can lead to false detection of
CKD or its progression. Thus, positive tests should beconﬁrmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD.
Large changes would be repeated to con ﬁrm increasing urine
albumin and urine protein. Chapter 2 discusses themagnitude of change to be considered a real change given theknown biological and analytical variability.
There is also biological variability in urine creatinine
excretion. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can
also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently
of changes in protein loss. In general, urine creatinine mea-surements are less susceptible to factors that interfere withSCr assays. If a more accurate quanti ﬁcation of albuminuria
or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin ortotal protein in a timed collection under supervised condi-tions as recommended above.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a ﬁrst morning
urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and pro-teinuria (in descending order of preference):
(i)Both urine PCR and urine ACR,
(ii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and foralbumin with automated reading, or
(iii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and foralbumin with manual reading.
Consistent with the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice
Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of ChronicKidney Disease,
1PCR is advised and preferred as initial
screening for children as the majority of children haveunderlying developmental abnormalities often referred to asCAKUT and a much higher proportion of children than
adults have tubular pathology.
303Testing for ACR may miss
tubular proteinuria. However, testing exclusively for
proteinuria does not allow characterization of the source. Ifurine PCR is used, urine ACR should also be measured tochapter 1 www.kidney-international.org
S192 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
better characterize proteinuria. Signi ﬁcant albuminuria
generally re ﬂects glomerular damage.304Importantly, in the
context of screening for children with diabetes, ACR
remains the standard, in line with adult guidelines.
The same considerations of using ﬁrst morning samples
(because of orthostatic proteinuria) and considering tran-siently increased proteinuria during intercurrent illness orafter exercise apply to children as well as adults. Orthostaticproteinuria is estimated to affect 2% –5% of adolescents.
305
Age and body size are important for interpreting proteinuria
and albuminuria. In term and preterm neonates, PCR is high(PCR 1000 –3000 mg/g [100 –300 mg/mmol]) in the ﬁrst days
and weeks of life, and is related to glomerular and tubular lossesof protein from immature nephrons, as well as very low creati-nine from low muscle mass. Recent studies outline proteinuriaranges for neonates, including for preterm and low-birth-weightneonates. As the tubules mature, proteinuria slowly declines. Ingeneral, a PCR of <500 mg/g ( <50 mg/mmol) (or a 24-hour
protein of <150 mg/m
2/d) is considered normal for infants aged
6 months to 2 years. For children over 2 years, a ﬁrst morning
urine PCR of <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) protein, or <150 mg/
m2/d, or a ﬁrst morning urine ACR <30 mg/g ( <3m g / m m o l )i s
usually considered normal.83,306–309More comprehensive values
can be found in Pediatric Nephrology .310
1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories
The following comments are focused on the laboratoryassessment of albuminuria, rather than total proteinuria, givenalbumin measurement is the preferred approach to proteinuriaevaluation (Section 1.3.1. ) However, some of these practice
points (sample type and storage, reporting as a PCR) would
apply equally to total protein measurement practices.
Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting
and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure
accuracy and reliability of the ﬁndings when assessing
urine samples.
Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external
quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and
creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferredpractice for laboratories.
Adoption of the reporting and handling standards for
assessment of urine samples is of paramount importance toensure that healthcare providers receive urine ACR reports ina consistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracyand reliability of the result.
Measurement of urine albumin for the detection of kidney
disease as with any analyte should be with methodologytraceable to international standards using a standard referencematerial. This is currently not the case, and results may varyby greater than 40% between laboratories depending on themethodology used with attendant impact on the interpreta-tion of reported results.
The type of urine collection and the analytical method
inﬂuence result interpretation. Twenty-four-hour urine col-
lections present problems in terms of completeness ofcollection, specimen storage, and timing accuracy. Therefore,the assessment of ACR from a single void is a common andconvenient clinical practice. The ACR accounts for hydrationand has similar diagnostic performance to 24-hour urineAER. The collection method should remain consistent, pref-erably using the ﬁrst morning void specimen.
If specimens are being stored for future analysis, careful
attention must be paid to the storage conditions to avoiddegradation of albumin leading to quanti ﬁcation error. The re-
ported effects of frozen storage on urine albumin are somewhatinconsistent. Albumin is generally stable in urine stored at 2
/C14C–8
/C14C for 7 days. However, losses of albumin have been reported
when urine is stored frozen at temperatures higher than /C080/C14C.
Precipitates often form when urine is stored refrigerated orfrozen but can be redissolved on warming: samples should be
warmed to room temperature and mixed before analysis.
290
Albumin losses may be affected by factors including period of
storage, sample albumin concentration, and individualvariation.
311It should be possible to provide refrigerated
storage and process samples for albumin measurement in alaboratory within 7 days in most healthcare settings.
The internationally accepted laboratory quality standards
are variably met worldwide, and laboratories are at different
levels with respect to quality. However, the Work Group placed
a high value on the accuracy and reliability of quanti ﬁcation of
albuminuria and judged that people with CKD, their healthcareproviders, and policy makers would want laboratories to ach-ieve these reporting and handling standards.
The direct costs of total protein measurement in urine are
lower than those of urine albumin. However, total proteinmeasurement lacks sensitivity for the detection of low but
clinically signi ﬁcant levels of albuminuria. For this, and other
reasons discussed in Section 1.3.1 , the measurement of ACR is
preferred to that of PCR.
Urine albumin should be measured using immunological
assays capable of speci ﬁcally and precisely quantifying albu-
min at low concentrations and of producing quantitative re-
sults over the clinically relevant range. The biologicalvariation of urine albumin exceeds 60%. Target analytical
variation (CV) should be based on an optimal level of <0.25
biological variation, approximately 15%. This is in keeping
with good practice recommendations from the NationalAcademy of Clinical Biochemistry.

Signiﬁcant progress has been made in developing a certi-
ﬁed reference material for urine albumin and a reference
measurement procedure.313,314However, current
commercially available assays for urine albumin are not
standardized against this reference material. Laboratories
should ensure that they are enrolled and demonstratesatisfactory performance in, an EQA scheme for urinealbumin, creatinine, and ACR.
Urine albumin (and protein) concentrations in urine
should be reported as a ratio to creatinine —ACR (or PCR).
Reporting as a ratio to creatinine corrects for variations inurinary ﬂow rate and enables reporting on untimed, spot
samples, obviating the need for timed, including 24-hour,collections, which are prone to collection error and tediousfor people to undertake. Reporting albumin as a ratio tocreatinine reduces the intraindividual variability in albumin-uria compared with reporting as albumin concentration alone(mg/mmol or mg/g).
315
To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare
systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number of
meaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach should
be used in relation to reporting units of ACR and PCR. ACRresults should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol)or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assaysare generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine inurine, although high concentrations of glucose can interferein Jaffe urine creatinine measurement and produce clinicallymeaningful errors in ACR.
1.4 Point-of-care testing
Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-
care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine andurine albumin measurement where access to a lab-
oratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-
care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C).
Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for
creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the samepreanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteriarelating to the specimen collection and performance of thedevice, including external quality assessment, and the
interpretation of the result is used.
Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine
testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use theequation consistent with that used within the region.
Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for
albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing
creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the
ability of the POCT ACR devices to produce a positiveresult in 85% of people with signi ﬁcant albuminuria (ACR
‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/mmol), as part of the evaluation and
consideration of using the device.This recommendation places a high value on the advantages
of POCTs including convenience, elimination of sample trans-portation to the central laboratory, minimal sample processing,simple analytic process, minimal sample requirement, and im-
mediate availability of results. It places a lower value on the
limited and heterogeneous data related to their diagnosticaccuracy.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. POCTs for both creatinine
and urine albumin have several potential bene ﬁts. POCT may
lead to earlier diagnosis, and as a result, earlier treatment ofCKD. They may also be used to monitor CKD progression,which enables more timely treatment decisions. The rapidreporting, low cost, and convenience to people with CKDcompared with central laboratory testing are also important
beneﬁts of POCTs. However, its provision can raise challenges
in relation to maintenance of analytical and diagnostic per-
formance, and governance arrangements. In addition, thesetests may be less accurate than laboratory testing, which maylead to misdiagnosis, misclassi ﬁcation, overtreatment, or
undertreatment. The balance of bene ﬁts and harms needs
rigorous evaluation speci ﬁc to each clinical situation.
For creatinine, the ERT identi ﬁed a systematic review from
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE)/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) diagnosticguideline that evaluated point-of-care creatinine tests to assessGFR before computed tomography (CT) scanning withcontrast media.
316The ERT also updated the ﬁndings of this
systematic review. The review from NICE/NIHR identi ﬁed
and qualitatively synthesized data from 54 studies ondiagnostic accuracy: eGFR diagnostic accuracy (n ¼12),
SCr diagnostic accuracy (n ¼7), and correlation and bias
of POC creatinine tests compared with laboratory-basedtests (n ¼50). One study
317was identi ﬁed in the update of
the NICE/NIHR review assessing POC creatinine testcompared with laboratory standards in a pediatricpopulation with malaria in Uganda.
These studies covered 3 types of devices: StatSensor, i-
STAT, and ABL devices. In general, all 3 devices demonstrated
acceptable accuracy at lower levels of eGFR (< 30 ml/min per
1.73 m
2).316Results showed that i-STAT and ABL devices may
have higher probabilities of correctly classifying people in the
same eGFR categories as the laboratory reference thanStatSensor devices.
For albumin, the ERT identi ﬁed a systematic review pub-
lished in 2014, by McTaggart et al. ,
318that evaluated the
diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative
protein or albumin urine dipstick tests compared with
laboratory-based tests among people with suspected ordiagnosed CKD. The ERT included relevant studies fromthis review and conducted an update.
Sixty- ﬁve studies (in 66 articles)
319–344,345–368,369–384eval-
uated the accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative pro-tein or albumin dipstick tests in a general population not onchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org

KRT or receiving end-of-life care. Studies addressed the
following critical outcomes: measurement bias (n ¼1),
analytical variability (n ¼5), analytical sensitivity (n ¼2),
and analytic speci ﬁcity (n ¼63) (Supplementary Table
S5336,347,363,372,373,377,382–384). Speci ﬁcity ranged from 17.5 to
99.5 when evaluative ACR $30 mg/g ($ 3 mg/mmol) and
30.0–98.7 when evaluative ACR $300 mg/g ($ 30 mg/
mmol). For PCR, speci ﬁcity ranged from 80.8 –96.9 when
evaluative PCR >200 mg/g (> 20 mg/mmol) and 75.6 –95.2
when evaluative PCR >500 mg/g ( >50 mg/mol).
The evidence regarding the performance of POCT for
creatinine and urine albumin is heterogeneous limiting the
determination of overall ﬁndings across these critical out-
comes. However, given the cost-effectiveness bene ﬁts, avail-
ability of the test in the absence of laboratory studies, and the
acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that inspeciﬁc clinical scenarios, POCT should be used.
Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence for POCT
for creatinine testing was rated as low due to consistentreporting of reference standards across all outcomes, with
some concerns regarding patient selection and ﬂow and
timing and directness of the evidence. The certainty of evi-
dence regarding performance of all POCT for urine albuminwas very low based on the Quality Assessment of DiagnosticAccuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) assessment of individualstudies due to sparse data, heterogeneous ﬁndings, and con-
cerns about patient selection, index tests, and unclearreporting of the reference standards.
Values and preferences. The recommendation suggested
that the majority of people with CKD who have limited accessto laboratories would choose to use POCT. These tests mayfacilitate people with CKD being seen at home or in remotesettings. Many people with CKD will value the immediateresults available with POCT versus waiting for the tests from alab. In addition, some people with CKD will place a highervalue on avoiding expensive lab tests that may not be covered
by their insurance, dif ﬁcult travel to central healthcare facil-
ities, and exposure to infection risk in hospital. These people
with CKD may also place a lower value on the potentialinaccuracies associated with POCTs compared with in-centerlaboratory testing.
Resource use and costs. For people with CKD, the use of
POCTs may be less expensive than tests conducted in aclinical laboratory. In areas with limited access to healthcare
and insurance, these tests may be cost saving and increase the
detection for CKD.
385,386For the healthcare system, some
direct reagent and staff costs of POCT tend to be higher ona per test basis than those of centralized laboratory testing,but these costs may be offset by other savings in the clinicalpathway, for example, through more rapid disease detectionor avoidance of hospital referral.
Considerations for implementation. POCTs may not be
available everywhere. Support from the local laboratory ser-
vice should be sought to guide the purchase, evaluation,
implementation, governance, and ongoing quality assuranceof POCT. The ability to test creatinine in a person ’s home may
have applicability to “virtual ward ”settings (hospital at
home).
It is worth noting that for albuminuria testing, the Na-
tional Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has proposed thatdevices should have 95% sensitivity for the detection of
albuminuria.
312This is not always achieved by POCT devices,
especially those that produce semiquantitative results.318
Rationale
POCT can be carried out in a wide range of settings including
primary care, community clinics, rural communities, andsecondary care supporting timely diagnosis, monitoring, andtreatment. Importantly, in locations where laboratory services
may be limited or nonexistent (e.g., rural and remote com-
munities), the ability to test versus not testing blood andurine was important. Advantages of POCT include conve-nience, elimination of sample transportation to the centrallaboratory, minimal sample processing because the analysis isof whole blood/urine, simple analytic process, minimalsample requirement, and immediate availability of results.However, these tests may be prone to errors and inaccuracies.
For these reasons, the recommendation suggests the use of
these tests based on the speci ﬁc clinical need or geographical/
social circumstances.
Use of POCT may facilitate access to earlier diagnosis and,
thus, care and can be implemented in rural and remote lo-cations. The value of POCT for currently underserved pop-ulations cannot be overstated and should include the capacityfor generating creatinine-based eGFR equations. The POCT
devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and
urine for albumin and creatinine to measure ACR and bestandardized and calibrated with similar rigor as is recom-mended for laboratory tests.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. The ability to use a small sample
volume, ﬁngerprick sample as opposed to venipuncture, may
have applicability to testing in children.

Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD
2.1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD
based upon GFR and ACR categories
Practice Point 2.1.1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or
albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at leastannually in people with CKD.
Monitoring CKD through the surveillance of albuminuria
and GFR serves to update staging for prognosis, identifytiming of intervention strategies, and assess the effectivenessof speci ﬁc treatments. No clear threshold de ﬁnes a clinically
relevant change in GFR or albuminuria, as any worseningcould re ﬂect deterioration in kidney health. However, over-
interpretation of small changes in these measures may lead tounnecessary changes in clinical management that could beunhelpful or even deleterious. Education for healthcare pro-
viders and people with CKD about the variability of speci ﬁc
laboratory measurements in kidney disease is important to
facilitate understanding and to mitigate inappropriatechanges in treatment strategies due to nonclinically signi ﬁcant
ﬂuctuations in either positive or negative directions.
There is an expected variability in GFR caused by both
biological and analytical factors of the biomarkers used(Figure 12 ). We have chosen to consider the 95% CI of test
reproducibility for both eGFR and ACR as an importantfactor for determining thresholds for clinical evaluation.The initial evaluation of an observed change in either eGFRor ACR should be to repeat the test(s) so as to determine ifthe observed change is clinically signi ﬁcant progression of
CKD or is within biological and analytical variability of thetest.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Monitoring of children in the per-
ipubescent phase should be undertaken more frequently thanthe CKD stage –based recommended frequency of monitoring
as puberty is a period of high risk of progression.
387Reasons
for this are incompletely understood, but potentialmechanisms include inability of diseased kidneys to undergothe hypertrophy needed to accompany the rapid somatic
growth that characterizes puberty and the negative effect of
increased levels of sex steroids.
388A study of over 900
children with CKD due to CAKUT showed a decline thatwas>10 times faster in creatinine-based eGFR after the
period of peak growth than before that period.
388The CKiD
study (including children with CKD of any cause) showedmore rapid declines in both eGFR (creatinine- and cystatinC–based) and mGFR after the period of peak growth velocity
than before.
387Frequency of monitoring should beindividualized, and informed by the severity of CKD, stage of
puberty, and observed recent rate of progression.
Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more
often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progressionwhen measurement will impact therapeutic decisions.
Previous guidelines have suggested the routine monitoring
of albuminuria and GFR. Prior guidelines have suggestedannual monitoring for those with CKD G1 –G2, every 6
months for those with CKD G3, every 3 months for CKD G4,
and every 6 weeks for CKD G5 disease. Given the greater risk
of disease progression, those with higher risk of diseaseprogression should undergo more frequent monitoring(Figure 13
29). More frequent monitoring may be indicated in
people with changing clinical status, intercurrent events, andafter therapeutic interventions to assess response andadherence and ensure safety. In addition, progression riskmay vary by the etiology of CKD within a speci ﬁc stage
based on GFR and albuminuria or proteinuria.
Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in
eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected
variability and warrants evaluation.
Within-subject variation in measured and eGFR is well
described (Figure 12 ). Thus, the ability to distinguish between
biological and analytical versus pathological variation in themGFR and eGFR is important for healthcare providers and
people with CKD. Studies show that intraindividual
biological variation in eGFR is similar across eGFRequations: CKD-EPI-creatinine (5.3% [4.5% –6.4%]), CKD-
EPI-cystatin C (5.3% [4.5% –6.5%]), and CKD-EPI-
creatinine-cystatin C (5.0% [4.3% –6.2%]). The reference
change value (RCV) is de ﬁned as the threshold of change
that differs from the individual’ s prior value with 95% CI;
in a cohort of people with CKD, eGFRcr and eGFRcys had
RCVs ranging from 14% –20% in the positive and negative
directions. Although attention to progressive loss of eGFR is
important, smaller changes in GFR may not be related totrue changes in kidney health, especially if transient andrequire cautious interpretation.
Thresholds for CKD progression used in clinical trials and
epidemiological studies are different than those suggested formonitoring of people with CKD. In research studies, 30% –
40% declines in GFR have been associated with increased riskfor kidney failure, and treatment effects on these endpointshave been associated with changes in risk for kidney failure.Because these are evaluated at the group level, small errors inindividual people with CKD are minimized.chapter 2 www.kidney-international.org
S196 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate
hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of>30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability
and warrant evaluation.
Acute eGFR decline after intensive BP control has been
observed in people with CKD, with reductions of 10% –20%
being typical within the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment. These
declines in eGFR are hemodynamically mediated, represent-ing a response to BP falling below the lower threshold of aperson ’s autoregulatory response. For many, this initial
decline in eGFR is transient and will stabilize or resolve overtime, as resetting of the autoregulatory function occurs. Thus,acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of <20%–30% are
expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents,
which may be important for cardio- and kidney-protective
effects in the long term. This phenomenon is especiallycommon when using ACEi/angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARBs), as they both lower BP and alter arteriolar ﬂow
through the glomeruli, and SGLT2i through similar hemo-dynamic mechanisms.
Post hoc analyses of trials of SGLT2i treatment in people with
diabetes, heart failure, and CKD suggested that participants
with>10% initial drop in eGFR have similar eGFR trajectories
and kidney bene ﬁts from SGLT2i compared with the“nondipper ”who received SGLT2i, except in unusual cases
when the acute “dip”in eGFR was >30% from baseline.
389,390
These ﬁndings were consistent across all subgroups.
A signi ﬁcant drop in eGFR (> 30%) while initiating anti-
hypertensive agents, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
(RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or
SGLT2i should prompt a review into other causes and war-
rants close monitoring. However, healthcare providers shouldavoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents,particularly because these earlier “dips”are typically reversible
and not an indication of drug toxicity.
Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people
with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test
exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.
Small ﬂuctuations in albuminuria or proteinuria levels
may not indicate disease progression. Appreciation of factors
that impact albuminuria and changes in the measure isimportant for healthcare providers. Routine surveillance us-ing ACR or PCR is warranted in higher risk people with CKD,as changes in urine ACR are associated with kidney failure.Speci ﬁcally, in large population studies, a doubling of the
ACR within a 2-year duration is associated with an increase inthe risk of progression to kidney failure by 50% –100%.

However, changes in albuminuria within an individual have
substantial variability, with large ﬂuctuations expected given
that the 95% CI around repeat ACR testing isapproximately 50%. For this reason, the Work Group has
deﬁned a doubling in albuminuria or more as exceeding the
expected variability and warranting evaluation if replicated
upon repeat testing. Conversely, reductions of the ACR byup to 50% are also consistent with random ﬂuctuation.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Increases in albuminuria and
proteinuria are also associated with increased risk of diseaseprogression in pediatric populations. A number of studies inpediatric subjects detailed in Table 18
225,228,393–398highlight
the value of measurement of albuminuria/proteinuria.
Considerations in older adults. Urine ACR in older adult
population may be elevated due to the loss of muscle massleading to lower SCr and lower urinary CrCl. In older adultsor people with frailty, the interpretation of urine ACR shouldtake into consideration age-related changes in muscle massand/or sarcopenia.
2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD
The CKD staging heatmaps re ﬂect RRs for each CKD cate-
gory compared with persons who do not have CKD at apopulation level; however, a person ’s absolute risk for each
outcome requires the use of risk prediction equations for thespeciﬁc adverse event.
Individual-level risk prediction can inform key clinical de-
cisions, improve the patient-healthcare provider dialogue, andenable personalized care for persons with CKD.
399The heatmap
concept introduced in the KDIGO 2012 CKD guidelineemphasizes the RR of adverse outcomes by levels of eGFR andalbuminuria in populations, and encourages healthcareproviders to classify those people with CKD as high risk forkidney, cardiovascular, and other adverse events based on those
2 parameters.
400The heatmaps also reinforce the importance
to all of using both eGFR and ACR for assessing severity and
prognosis of CKD and are color-coded to indicate those RRs inpopulations but do not enable individual risk prediction.
However, the people within a speci ﬁc“cell”on the grid or
within an eGFR/ACR category have a wide range of absoluterisks for each of the adverse outcomes of interest. An indi-vidual person ’s risk for each outcome is in ﬂuenced by their
underlying etiology of CKD, demographic characteristics,comorbid conditions, and other factors including lifestyle,SES, nutrition, and intercurrent events. Thus, the RRs shownin the heatmap tables can be crudely interpreted as a multi-plier superimposed upon the aforementioned other charac-teristics. There can be substantial variability and overlap, upto 8000% in the risk of CKD progression or 4000% in the riskof kidney failure, for 2 people in the same heatmap category
or CKD stage ( Figure 14
401,402)402; therefore, individual risk
prediction using accurate and externally validated risk
equations is important in the personalization of care andcan be used to inform absolute risk for individual people.
The corollary to individualizing absolute risks versus RRs
is appreciating the absolute versus relative bene ﬁts of disease-
modifying therapies. Although the relative bene ﬁts of medi-
cations such as SGLT2i may appear similar across subgroups,
the actual bene ﬁt on speci ﬁc outcomes is highest among
people who have the higher absolute risks for that
outcome.
403Risk prediction equations can be used to better
identify these people and perform better than healthcareTable 18 | Impact of albuminuria/proteinuria on CKD progression in pediatrics
Study Impact of albuminuria/proteinuria
ESCAPE228A 50% reduction of proteinuria within the ﬁrst 2 months of treatment initiation more than halved the risk of progression of kidney
disease over 5 years.
Gluck et al.225In a cohort of over 7 million children, 0.1% had CKD G2 or higher. The relative risk of CKD progression, de ﬁned as reaching CKD G5 or
having a 50% decline in eGFR, was doubled for those who had $1þproteinuria on dipstick without hypertension and was
quadrupled for those with proteinuria and hypertension over a median follow-up of 5 years.
CKiD393ACR of >300 mg/g ( >30 mg/mmol) was associated with an 84% higher risk of disease progression over a median follow-up of 3 years
compared with an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol). PCR of 630 mg/g (71 mg/mmol) was associated with an 87% higher risk of
disease progression compared with a PCR of 140 mg/g (16 mg/mmol).

study394,395Each log higher value of ACR was associated with a 50% higher risk of kidney failure or a 50% decline in eGFR over a median
follow-up of 3 years. A 115% increase in albuminuria was associated with faster disease progression after cessation of RASi in children
with advanced CKD.

survival over 5 years in the lower proteinuria groups: 97% and 94% vs. 45%.

provider subjective estimation of risk.404Several risk
prediction tools have been developed speci ﬁcally for people
with CKD, and when implemented, allow healthcare
providers to more precisely estimate risk for individualpeople for speci ﬁc outcomes, which supports a deeper
personalization of CKD management.
405,406Besides
improving individual risk prediction, these tools may beused to more effectively use specialized and often scarce,nephrology resources, identify people for earlier use of
disease-modifying therapy, or enable personalized
discussions of overall goals of care. Importantly, some ofthe developed prediction models have been externallyvalidated in multiple populations, have high discriminationperformance (C-statistics >0.8 or higher), and are easily
used via online calculators ( Table 19
9,10,407–411).
Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3– G5,
we recommend using an externally validated risk
equation to estimate the absolute risk of kidneyfailure (1A).This recommendation places a high value on the need and po-
tential bene ﬁts for individual risk prediction to deliver person-
alized care for people with CKD. The recommendation is worded
to encourage healthcare providers, patients, researchers, andpolicy makers to go beyond broad categories of RR for popula-tion and to estimate the absolute risk of outcomes for each in-dividual. The recommendation also places a high value onexternally validated prediction equations that can be applied indiverse healthcare settings and the need for implementation
science in laboratory information systems and EMRs to enable
the delivery of risk-based care for people with CKD.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. There is a large body of
evidence to support the use of the validated risk equations toestimate the absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysisor transplant in people with CKD G3 –G5. Risk equations
using routinely collected data have been developed, externallyvalidated, and implemented in labs, EMRs, and healthsystems.

Multiple systematic reviews and quality assessments of risk
prediction equations have been performed in the last 10 years,
with the most recent review published in 2020.405This review
included 35 development studies and 17 external validation
studies, and described the variables included in the
prediction models and provided a decision aid for selectingthe best model for the prediction horizon and theunderlying etiology of kidney disease. More recently, anadditional externally validated model using serum cystatinC has also been developed in Germany and externallyvalidated in 3 European cohorts.
409A summary of
externally validated models for kidney failure is provided
below and in Table 19 .9,10,407–411
We highlight here 3 validated models, The Kidney Failure
Risk Equation (KFRE), the Veterans Affairs model, and the Z6
Score model. All of these use routinely collected data fromlabs or EMRs and have been validated in different pop-ulations, both in North America and internationally tovarying degrees. Detailed review of all existing predictionmodels is beyond the scope of this document.
The KFRE was developed and initially validated in 8391 adults
from 2 Canadian provinces, and subsequently validated in721,357 individuals from more than 30 countries spanning 4continents.
9,10In this large validation study, cohorts from both
general populations and nephrology clinic settings wereincluded. Discrimination was excellent (C-statistic >0.80 in 28/
30 cohorts), and the use of a calibration factor improvedcalibration for some regions outside of North America; the
validation populations now exceed 2 million individuals in
more than 60 cohorts from nearly every continent.
407,408The
KFRE is consistently highly accurate and has not been improvedby the addition of longitudinal slopes or variability of eGFR andurine ACR, or by adding cardiovascular comorbidities.
407
A further 2 externally validated models from large US
health systems (Kaiser Permanente North West and VeteransAffairs) also use routinely collected data and predict kidney
failure with high accuracy within a 5-year horizon.
410,414Only
1 externally validated model for kidney failure has been
developed using serum cystatin C (Z6 model), and althoughit is highly accurate in 4 European cohorts, it has not beenvalidated in other continents.
409
The Work Group judged that the published externally vali-
dated models (delineated in Table 199,10,407–411) all had
sufﬁcient accuracy to be used in clinical settings. Given the
potential bene ﬁts and utility of knowing the risk of kidney
failure, patients and healthcare providers should beencouraged to use these tools. Assessing risk of progressioncan aid in optimizing healthcare delivery services, facilitatethe earlier identi ﬁcation of individuals for disease-modifying
therapy, help with planning for modality education, andidentify goals of care planning. There are limited butsupportive studies describing the better prediction of
outcomes when using risk equations compared with care that
is delivered according to isolated eGFR values and clinicaljudgment. Potential harms from the use of predictionequations could result from inappropriate use in the settingsof AKI or AKD or in younger individuals with CKD G1 –G2
who may be at high risk of progression but low risk of kidneyfailure in the next 5 years. In these people, more proximaloutcomes such as 40% decline in GFR or lifetime risk were
judged to be more appropriate (i.e., establishing a validated
risk equation for the appropriate outcome of interest, derivedfrom the population of interest). As described above,healthcare providers should be cognizant of the impact ofbiological and analytical variability in albuminuria and eGFRvalues and the subsequent impact on calculation of predictedrisk of kidney failure.
Certainty of the evidence. To assess the certainty of evidence,
the ERTexamined 2 existing systematic reviews addressing thequestion of the ability of risk prediction models to predictkidney failure (see Supplementary Table S6 ).
406,415The 2021
review from NICE in the United Kingdom (UK) assessed thecertainty of evidence for a variety of risk-based equations topredict kidney failure and concluded that there was high-quality evidence to state that the chosen risk predictionequations accurately predict kidney failure.
415There was high
certainty of the evidence (C-statistics were high, and the CIswere narrow). The Tangri 2013 review did not assess thecertainty of evidence as part of the review (SupplementaryTables S6 –S9
9,85,89,94,96,408,416).406
The Work Group agreed with the NICE assessment and
considered evidence from other systematic reviews andrecently published validation studies. The certainty of evi-dence was based on the established and growing evidence base
for clinical validation and clinical utility as well as feasibility
for validated risk prediction equations that predict kidneyfailure.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that the
accurate prediction of kidney failure was of importance topeople with CKD, their families, and healthcare providers,and that most people with CKD would choose to receiveprognostic information about their individual risk of kidney
failure as part of routine care. For a global guideline, the Work
Group focused on prediction equations that were externallyvalidated, had a low risk of bias, and included variables thatwere routinely available in most healthcare settings.
Resource use and costs. Most externally validated risk
equations for predicting kidney failure use routinely collecteddata including laboratory variables such as eGFR, albumin-uria, and serum albumin, phosphate, calcium, or hemoglo-
bin, or information on demographics and comorbid
conditions that can be easily obtained. As such, these modelscan be easily implemented at low cost to health systems. Only1 externally validated model (Z6 Score) used cystatin C, andits usability in global health will depend on the potentialincreased routine availability of cystatin C in laboratoriesworldwide.
Considerations for implementation. Given the potential
value of risk prediction models for planning and care de-cisions, healthcare providers should consider how to integraterisk prediction models into clinical practice, either in EMRs,laboratory information systems, or using other mechanismschapter 2 www.kidney-international.org
S200 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
(mobile apps). These should aid clinical work ﬂow and deci-
sion-making and even patient understanding. Where possible,
laboratories should report the results from a validated riskequation speci ﬁc to the region automatically for individuals
with CKD G3 –G5 when the required variables are available.
Simpler equations can be implemented and reported whenminimal data are available and more complex equations,requiring additional variables, can be implemented if therequired data are present.
The reporting of risk in the laboratory reports and EMRs
should be standardized with appropriate guidance on riskthresholds, when available. Local validation studies can be
performed to determine optimal calibration of the speci ﬁc
risk prediction equations before implementation. Imple-
mentation of risk equations that are externally validated anduse routinely collected data should be prioritized for healthequity and global health considerations.
Rationale
Risk prediction equations that are externally validated, andlocally calibrated, when possible, can lead to improvement inthe delivery of CKD care. These equations should be used asthey can further personalize care plans for people with CKDand enable discussions about the bene ﬁts and harms of dis-
ease-modifying therapy.
This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group
judged that the evidence supporting both the clinical validityand clinical utility of risk prediction equations was suf ﬁciently
strong to recommend widespread adoption. The Work Groupjudged that most externally validated equations rely onroutinely collected data and could therefore be implementedequally in low-resource settings. The Work Group also judgedthat the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calcu-lating the risk of kidney failure and discussing the risk and
related treatment decisions with patients and caregivers.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Work from the CKiD group (2015)
provides a risk calculator for disease progression, using age, sex,
glomerular versus nonglomerular disease, eGFR, hypertensionand laboratory parameters (calculator available at https://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculatorPedRiskCalc ).
417
Further analyses combining the CKiD data with that from theESCAPE trial (of BP control in CKD progression in children)resulted in a risk calculator that uses diagnosis, eGFR and
proteinuria, and can be accessed at www.ckdprognosis.
com.
418The 4-value KFRE has been validated in the CKiD
cohort with good discrimination.416However, further
evaluation of the calibration in the cohort revealed
incongruence between predicted and observed outcomes inthose with higher predicted risks of kidney failure (who hadlower observed risks).
419
Considerations regarding sex and gender. There is uncer-
tainty around whether sex assigned at birth or gender identityis to be used in risk equations. At present, a holistic approachshould be used that takes into account sex assigned at birth,sex hormone milieu, and gender identity with shared deci-sion-making with the person with CKD.
Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% –5%
can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in
addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and otherclinical considerations.
In most developing and developed countries, there are
insufﬁcient nephrology care resources to manage all people
with CKD. Using an objective tool to appropriately triagethose most likely to bene ﬁt from referral may help to manage
those nephrology resources in an evidence-informed manner.Because only a small fraction of the CKD population is athigh risk for progression to kidney failure, those people withlower risks of progression to kidney failure may be effectively
managed in primary care settings with guideline-based
treatments to delay CKD progression (Figure 15 ). Referral
criteria for nephrology services that include a risk thresholdof 3% –5% over 5 years have been examined retrospectively
and have also been implemented prospectively in severalhealthcare settings.
420,421
In settings within Canada and the UK, retrospective
studies have found that the use of these risk thresholds has
avoided harms from nonreferral or delayed referral of those
progressing to kidney failure.412In addition, prospective
evaluation has demonstrated a reduction in nephrology

referral wait times, particularly for high-risk individuals. In
other clinical settings with relatively scarce access tonephrology care, these thresholds should be adjusted toensure that wait times are acceptable for local standards.
421
Discussion of risk should also consider the individualperson, their comorbidities, and their risk of death fromother causes.
Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10%
can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary
care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinicalconsiderations.
People with CKD G4 –G5 are more likely to develop con-
current complications of CKD including anemia, hyper-kalemia, bone mineral disorders, and/or metabolic acidosisand protein-energy wasting. In addition, they remain at highrisk for adverse events including AKI, emergency departmentvisits, and hospitalizations. As such, in many countries andhealthcare settings, these people may be enrolled in inter-disciplinary care clinics or receive care management resources
to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs, and to avoid un-
planned dialysis initiation.
A risk threshold risk of >10% over 2 years has been
studied and implemented in some jurisdictions in Canada asthe key eligibility criteria for access to interdisciplinary carethat includes a nurse, pharmacist, renal dietitian or accreditednutrition provider, and other allied health support. Thispractice point is based on results from these studies, which
demonstrate acceptance and preference of a risk-based
criteria by patients and providers.
422Given the costs
associated with delivery of care management resources andinterdisciplinary models, risk-based thresholds offer a usefulguide to the selection of the ideal target patient populationto derive most bene ﬁt from the highly specialized team. It
is important to note that people with CKD at earlier stagesor those at lower risk of progression may bene ﬁt from an
individual allied health resource (e.g., pharmacist ordietitian); however, risk-based thresholds provide a guide toidentify people with CKD who bene ﬁt most from an entire
multidisciplinary team.
Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold
of>40% can be used to determine the modality education,
timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy
(KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for
transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria andother clinical considerations.
The appropriate timing for modality education, timing of
vascular access planning, or referral for transplantation in aperson with low or declining GFR can be dif ﬁcult to predict.
Vascular access planning in all adults with CKD G4 wouldlead to the unnecessary placement of ﬁstulae, whereas waiting
until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m
2may lead to
inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysisinitiation. Studies have described the potential utility of risk-based thresholds in planning for dialysis access speci ﬁcallyand found acceptable speci ﬁcity and positive predictive values
for the risk-based threshold criteria as compared with eGFRalone. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular ac-cess guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based
threshold >50% or eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m
2for
initiation of vascular access planning, while acknowledging
that access to surgeons and primary failure to maturationrates may vary by patient and by center.
423
Based on current evidence, a threshold of >40% risk or an
eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2is acceptable to use for
initiating vascular access referral. Lower risk thresholds, suchas>20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate
modality education, and may be appropriate for presurgicalvascular access planning or referral for transplantation incenters with longer wait times.
Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations
developed for use in people with CKD G3 –G5, may not be
valid for use in those with CKD G1 –G2.
The Work Group recognizes that the progression of CKD
can occur at all severities, and that in earlier stages of disease(G1–G3), large declines in eGFR can occur in 2- to 5-year
time frames without reaching kidney failure (Figure 16
424).
Risk prediction models developed in populations with later
stages of CKD are not accurate in CKD G1 –G2, whereas
alternative, accurate, externally validated risk predictionequations have been developed for predicting 40% decline ineGFR or kidney failure at all stages of CKD. For this

intermediate CKD progression outcome, 3 recent publica-
tions present models for people with or without diabetes,using both regression and machine learning –based methods,
with or without biomarkers ( Table 20 ).
8,424,425Given the
potential utility of these new models to identify high-riskpeople for early intervention, they should be used to predictdisease progression in people with CKD G1 –G2 and may
supplement established risk equations among people with
CKD G3. People with CKD identi ﬁed as intermediate risk
(e.g.,>1% per year) with these tools may bene ﬁt from the
earlier initiation of therapy and closer follow-up, and those
identi ﬁed as high risk (e.g., >5% per year) may have the
largest bene ﬁt from multidrug therapy to slow progression.
Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speci ﬁc, externally vali-
dated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin
A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease (ADPKD).
Risk prediction models for speci ﬁc etiologies of CKD have
also been developed, are externally validated, and used inhealthcare settings to guide clinical care. For autosomal domi-nant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 2 equations can beuseful in determining the longer-term risk of kidney failure andmay guide therapy with tolvaptan— the Mayo Clinic Classi ﬁ-
cation tool and the Predicting Renal Outcome in PolycysticKidney Disease (PROPKD) score,
426,427which incorporates
genetic data. Of these, the Mayo Clinic Classi ﬁcation tool has
been shown to be accurate in external validation.
In people with IgAN, 2 externally validated prediction
tools (clinical or clinical þhistology) have been developed
using large international cohort studies. Models that includedthe mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hyper-
cellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular at-
rophy/interstitial ﬁbrosis (T) (MEST) histological score were
more accurate (C-statistic: 0.81 –0.82 vs. 0.78) and showed
improved reclassi ﬁcation in development and external vali-
dation datasets.
428,429Given the availability of accurate
externally validated models, these should be preferentiallyused over more general CKD models in people with anestablished diagnosis of IgAN or ADPKD. It is important to
note that the clinical presentation of IgAN can include
rapidly progressive disease, and people with rapidlyprogressive GN may not have been well represented in thecohorts used to develop existing prediction tools.2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with
CKD
Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to
guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use externallyvalidated models that are either developed within CKDpopulations or that incorporate eGFR and albuminuria.
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportion-
ately affect people with CKD, and risk prediction toolsdeveloped in the general (non-CKD) population may un-
derestimate the risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) or
heart failure in CKD populations. Absolute risk is used todetermine eligibility for disease-modifying pharmacologicaltherapy in CVD guidelines, and underestimation of risk maylead to suboptimal treatment of people with CKD, perpetu-ating biases (“ renalism ”) that have existed for more than 2
decades. New models that have been developed speci ﬁcally in
adults with CKD (QRISK3
430) and severe CKD (ckdpc.org ),6
and modi ﬁcations to existing CVD models (pooled cohort
equations [PCE]/Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation[SCORE]
431) that include eGFR and albuminuria should be
used to predict cardiovascular events in individuals withCKD.
390–393,427,428,430,431,432In the case of the PCE, the
CKD patch signi ﬁcantly improves the calibration of ASCVD
risk, and the eGFR patch improves the prediction of CVDmortality using SCORE. Recently, the American Heart
Association Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT /C212
,
pending) equations were developed in over 6 million US
adults aged 30 –79 years without known CVD with
outcomes of incident ASCVD and HF (combined and
separately).433,434These equations included eGFR in the
primary model and included ACR in an add-on model, sothey may be particularly appropriate for people with CKD.
Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide
discussions about goals of care, use externally validatedmodels that predict all-cause mortality speci ﬁcally devel-
oped in the CKD population.
People with CKD are at high risk of all-cause mortality,
and the competing risk of death can affect clinical decision-making, particularly for older adults with CKD G4, who maysimultaneously be at high risk of kidney failure requiringdialysis. All-cause mortality can be challenging to predict dueto the multiple biological pathways and differences inTable 20 | Externally validated risk models for predicting a 40% decline in GFR

by risk prediction models. Models developed by the CKD-PCfor multiple outcomes in CKD G4 þpredict the risk of death,

years and were developed using multinational data.

A 5-year mortality model was also developed in the Car-
diovascular Health Study in older adults from the United
States, where the majority of people had CKD G3.434Both
models have modest discrimination (C-statisticsapproximately 0.70). These may be more appropriate toidentify high-risk groups, where earlier discussions aboutconservative care pathways or alternative goals of care mayhave been helpful. These models should not be used to
determine the futility of initiating KRT.

Chapter 3: Delaying CKD progression and managing
its complications
3.1 CKD treatment and risk modi ﬁcation
Practice Point 3.1.1: Treat people with CKD with a
comprehensive treatment strategy to reduce risks ofprogression of CKD and its associated complications
(Figure 17 ).
Risk factors associated with CKD progression, CVD, and
other CKD complications are highly interrelated,
435and
hence so is their management. We use the term “CKD
treatment and risk modi ﬁcation ”to encompass the aim of
CKD treatment, which is to impart meaningful bene ﬁcial
effects on “CKD manifestations” and on “CKD outcomes ”
(Figure 17 ). CKD manifestations include symptoms and
clinical/laboratory abnormalities associated with CKD,
which confer health implications. These include increasedBP, anemia, dyslipidemia, CKD-mineral and bone disorder(CKD-MBD), potassium disorders, severe acidosis,decreased fertility, and increased risk of complications ofpregnancy. CKD outcomes refer to progression to kidneyfailure and CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. Theseare wide ranging and include several CVDs, hospitalization,
infections, and gout. Reducing the risk of CKD progression
by targeting its underlying pathophysiology may havebeneﬁcial effects on a range of CKD manifestations and
CKD-associated outcomes, although some complicationsmay need speci ﬁc targeted interventions. Healthcare systems
should aim to provide safe and proven cost-effectivetherapies that achieve CKD treatment and risk modi ﬁcation
and to minimize limitations to access for people with CKDas their disease can substantially impact on QoL andhealthcare system resources. A key goal for healthcareproviders should be to identify people at risk and to startsuch treatments early in the course of CKD to maximizepotential bene ﬁts.
This chapter provides evidence-based guidelines to sup-
port holistic management of the risks associated with CKD
(Figure 18 ). Previously published KDIGO clinical practice
guidelines for the management of BP, diabetes, lipids,
anemia, and CKD-MBD in CKD are available and supportour statements.
19–21,23,436This chapter also describes certain
laboratory abnormalities including bicarbonate, potassium,and uric acid, together with a summary of the observedranges associated with different stages of CKD
3.2 Lifestyle factors
Practice Point 3.2.1: Encourage people with CKD to under-take physical activity compatible with cardiovascular health,
tolerance, and level of frailty; achieve an optimal body mass
index (BMI); and not to use tobacco products. Referral toproviders and programs (e.g., psychologists, renal dietitiansor accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, physical andoccupational therapy, and smoking cessation programs)should be offered where indicated and available.

This practice point calls out the need for a comprehensive
and integrated approach to lifestyle modi ﬁcation and recog-
nizes that in some circumstances, there is value in referring
people to professionals or programs with expertise in lifestyle
modi ﬁcation. We also appreciate that different healthcare
systems and regions will have variable access to suchspecialized services or teams, and thus availability may be anissue.
3.2.1 Avoiding use of tobacco products
The Work Group concurs with the previous KDIGO recom-mendations to advise people with diabetes and CKD who uset o b a c c ot oq u i tu s i n gt o b a c c op r o d u c t s
23and extends that advice
to all people with CKD who use tobacco products to reduce therisk of associated premature mortality from CVD, as well as risk
of respiratory diseases and cancer.
437Intensive nurse-led
programs appear effective at supporting smoking abstinence
and can be combined with pharmacological intervention (e.g.,nicotine replacement therapy of nicotine-receptor partialagonists) to improve smoking abstinence over 16 weeks.

3.2.2 Physical activity and optimum weight
The Work Group concurs with all the recommendation and
practice points relating to physical activity from the KDIGO
2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Managementin Chronic Kidney Disease
23and considers that they should
extend to all adults with CKD. We draw attention to thefollowing statements:
Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that peo-
ple with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-
intensity physical activity for a cumulative durationof at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level
compatible with their cardiovascular and physical
tolerance (1D).
Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical ac-
tivity should consider age, ethnic background, presence ofother comorbidities, and access to resources.
Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised
to avoid sedentary behavior.
Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls,
healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensityof physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and thetype of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both).
Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/
encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight.
BMI relates to levels of adiposity on a population scale (though
imperfectly), and a BMI of over 25 kg/m
2in adults (i.e., overweight
or obese) is associated with an inc reased risk of multiple chronic
diseases including development of CKD.439,440Such adiposity-
CKD associations appear to be causal.441,442BMI can
overestimate risk in people with high muscle mass,443and risk
for a given BMI may vary by ethnicity (with Asians being athigher risk of metabolic disorders at lower BMIs than
Europeans).
443,444Nevertheless, it is important to provide people
with CKD advice about their weight using BMI in conjunction
with other information, including ethnicity, diet, comorbidity,physical activity levels, risk of falls, and laboratory values.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD toundertake physical activity aiming for World Health Or-ganization (WHO) –advised levels (i.e., ‡60 minutes daily)
and to achieve a healthy weight.
The WHO recommends 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity daily for children 5 –17 years old, including aer-
obic activities as well as activities that strengthen muscle andbone.
445Limits on sedentary time, particularly screen time, are
also recommended. For children 1 –5y e a r so fa g e ,1 8 0m i n u t e s
per day of physical activity is recommended; young children int h i sa g eg r o u ps h o u l dn o tb er e s t r a i n e d( i . e . ,i nas t r o l l e ro rcarrier) for >60 minutes at a time. Only 13.4% of 224
participants of the CKiD study aged $12 years (median: 15
years) met these WHO targets,
240,257,303,305,446compared with
25% of general population children of comparable age.447Less
than 2% of CKiD participants met screen timerecommendations ( <2 hours per day on school days)
compared with 27% of the general population. Physical activityhas numerous bene ﬁts for cardiovascular, mental, and social
health. Given that children with CKD are at higher risk forproblems in all these areas, physical activity may be even moreimportant in the CKD population.
3.3 Diet
Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt
healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of
plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and alower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.
Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited
nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about di-etary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potas-sium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs,
and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions.
Plant-based diets use proportionately more plant-based food
choices, and animal-based food is consumed in moderation.
Diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension(DASH) are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fatdairy foods. A Mediterranean diet pattern is built aroundvegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, whole grains, and seafoodbut also includes moderate amounts of dairy, meat, and eggs.
By de ﬁnition, vegan and vegetarian diets are plant-based. A
whole-food, plant-based diet low in animal-based and ultra-
processed foods may be helpful to slow the progression of CKDand delay need for dialysis via reduction of cardiometabolic riskfactors such as hypertension, CVD, diabetes, and obesity.
448,449
Ultraprocessed foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fastfoods, frozen meals, chips, candy, and pastries are high insalt, sugar, and fat, and low in nutritional value, and they
promote in ﬂammation, which may contribute to worsening
kidney function. A plant-based diet is rich in anti-
inﬂammatory nutrients, ﬁber, and phytochemicals, and has
been shown to reduce proteinuria and decrease metabolicacidosis.
448,449The probiotic nature of plant-based foods may
also support the microbiome and reduce in ﬂammation and
intestinal production of uremic toxins.450A recent systematic
review evaluated the association of dietary patterns and
kidney-related outcomes.451,452Dietary patterns that include
more plant-based unprocessed protein have been
demonstrated, in cohort studies and small RCTs, to slow thetrajectory of eGFR decline, reduce the risk of kidney failure,reduce risk of mortality, and improve scores in some QoLdomains (e.g., DASH and Mediterranean diet).www.kidney-international.org chapter 3
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S207
3.3.1 Protein intake
Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a
protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults
with CKD G3– G5(2C).
Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg
body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression.
Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing
and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, considerprescribing, under close supervision, a very low –protein
diet (0.3 –0.4 g/kg body weight/d) supplemented with
essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kgbody weight/d).
Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low –
protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD.
This recommendation places a higher value on slowing the
rate of GFR decline without the challenges associated with
adherence to lower-protein diets, potential adverse effects, andthe contraindications in people with sarcopenia, cachexia, orundernutrition. The Work Group judged that many well-informed people with CKD G3 –G5 would choose to implement
this recommendation.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. The Work Group considered
that maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight perday in adults in the absence of indications for a higher orlower protein intake was congruent with a person ’s culture
and QoL. Considerations for protein restriction in the contextof individual preferences, true impact on CKD progressionbased on etiology, and other factors need to be consideredand weighed against any potential adverse impacts, such asmalnutrition.
In many societies, most adults and older adults consume
more protein than recommended, with average protein intakesof 1.2 g/kg/d.
453,454There is general agreement that, in the
absence of intercurrent disease, the protein requirements forpeople with CKD are not different from those of healthysubjects.
455The Work Group thus suggests maintaining a
protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d, a target consistentwith the WHO Recommended Dietary Allowances for thegeneral population.
456,457Figure 1923shows some examplesof the amount of protein in grams that would berecommended based on body weight. Clinicians shouldadvise people with CKD not to confuse grams of protein perday with the weight of food in grams (i.e., 100 g of meat
contains only approximately 25 g of protein; Figure 20
23).
Unlike carbohydrates and fats, excess dietary proteins
cannot be stored in the body and are catabolized, leading to
accumulation of protein waste products such as urea andother uremic toxins. As CKD progresses, these byproductsaccumulate and affect organ function. High-protein intakealso contributes to increased intraglomerular pressure andglomerular hyper ﬁltration, which, in turn, may lead to glo-
merulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury.
458,459
Progressive decline in kidney function is also associatedwith a spontaneous loss of appetite potentially leading toinadequate protein and energy intake.
460The Work Group
therefore encourages maintaining protein intake in adultswith CKD within the recommended range around 0.8 g/kgbody weight/d, and particularly avoiding excess proteinintakes ( >1.3 g/kg of body weight/d), which may be
harmful for the kidney.
455There is observational evidence
suggesting that excess protein intake may accelerate kidneyfunctional decline.
461–463
The protein type, not only the quantity, may also be
relevant. Table 21 brieﬂy summarizes the impact of plant-
based diets in people with CKD.464–470In another cohort
study of older subjects (N ¼291, mean age 76 years) with
eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, there was no signi ﬁcant
association between vegetable protein intake and change ineGFR.
460Observational studies452,464,465and an RCT466
have associated a higher plant-based protein relative toanimal-based protein consumption or adherence to plant-based protein dominant diets with slower eGFR declineover time and lower risk of death; no study so far hasassessed the measures of patient preferences.
471It is unclear
whether the associations are attributed to plant-based
protein intake per se or to other nutrients or lifestyle habits
that accompany the plant-based protein intervention;
however, there is biological plausibility. A crossover study of10 healthy individuals fed for 3 weeks evaluated the effectof a plant-based protein diet versus an animal-based proteindiet on kidney function parameters. Both diets provided thesame amount of total protein per day. Compared withanimal-based protein, a plant-based protein diet reduced
renal plasma ﬂow, increased renal vascular resistance, and
lowered the fractional clearance of albumin.

A low-protein intake (< 0.8 g/kg body weight/d) reduces
uremia and uremic toxin generation and improves kidney
hemodynamics by constricting the glomerular afferent arte-rioles and lowering intraglomerular pressure.
458,474,475Low-
protein diets and very low –protein diets have been used for
almost a century as a strategy to reduce clinical symptomsand postpone the need to start maintenance dialysistreatment. They may also reduce uremic complications andsymptoms, such as metabolic acidosis and phosphate load.
476
The Work Group considers that the evidence does not sup-
port a recommendation to follow low-protein diets alone (i.e.,0.4–0.6 g/kg of body weight/d) as a strategy to slow the pro-
gression of CKD. In a meta-analysis of people with CKD withoutdiabetes,
477a low-protein diet compared with a normal-protein
diet in participants with CKD G3a and G3b (9 studies) or CKDG4 (1 study) found little or no difference in mortality or eGFRdecline and little or no difference in the number of
participants who reached kidney failure (6 studies, 1814
participants: RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.73 –1.53). Similar null
associations were observed in a meta-analysis of 8 studiesinvolving people with diabetes and CKD.
478
However, there is some evidence that very low –protein diets
(i.e., 0.3 –0.4 g/kg of body weight/d) under strict supervision
can favorably impact kidney outcomes. A meta-analysis ofstudies including people with CKD G4 –G5 without diabetes
reported that very low –protein diets compared with low-pro-
tein diet or normal-protein diet may reduce the number ofpeople who reach kidney failure (10 studies, 1010 participants:RR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49 –0.85).
477Data on adverse effects, such
as weight loss and malnutrition, and on QoL were limited.There is limited evidence on the use of very low –protein diets
in people with CKD and diabetes.

Very low –protein diets are usually vegetarian or vegan diets
and may risk de ﬁciencies of some essential amino acids. A
strategy to counteract this is the addition of supplements of
essential amino acids or precursors of essential amino acids (i.e.,
ketoacid analogs). By lacking the amino group, ketoacid analogs
serve as substrates for protein synthesis without the productionof toxic nitrogenous waste products. Limitations of ketoacidanalogs are, however, high pill burden and high cost. Fifteenmonths of strict adherence to vegetarian very low –protein diets
of 0.3 g/kg body weight/d supplemented with 0.125 g/kg bodyweight/d of ketoacids in people with an average eGFR of 18 ml/min per 1.73 m
2at baseline slowed the decline in eGFR,
increased bicarbonate levels, and reduced the need for KRTcompared with a control group that ate a mixed-protein diet of0.6 g/kg body weight/d.
479A recent pragmatic trial was not able
to reproduce this ﬁnding,480potentially attributed by the
authors to challenges in patient compliance with the treatment.
There is concern that low-protein and very low –protein diets
may result in malnutrition. However, in the meta-analysis byHahn et al.,
47712 studies reported no evidence of malnutrition
in their study participants, whereas 3 studies reported smallnumbers of participants in each arm with worseningnutritional status. The estimated average requirement forprotein intake in adults is approximately 0.5 –0.6 g/kg body
weight/d, which corresponds to the amount of proteinrequired to avoid negative nitrogen balance.
456Thus under
correct supervision, these diets may not lead to malnutrition.Malnutrition may arise if the reduction in protein is followed
by a reduction in energy intake. This may be preventable by
adequate patient education on food choices and closesupervision by renal dietitians or accredited nutritionspecialists. A patient-centered approach involves a sharedunderstanding of treatment goals, effective communication toalleviate anxieties around food or food misconceptions,individualized advice that matches cultural values andpreferences, and assistance with implementation of dietetic
advice in the face of a large symptom burden.
Some of the trials on low-protein diets were conducted
before treatment with RASi was introduced, and all of them
before the SGLT2i era. Because the mechanism of action ofthese medications and that of low-protein and very low –
protein diets are complementary, it has been postulated thatthese strategies may synergize and maximize their combinedeffect on delaying CKD progression.
475,481,482Studies are
needed to demonstrate this hypothesis.
Low- or very low –protein diets are not indicated in people
who are metabolically unstable or during periods of metabolicinstability. This includes conditions that may exacerbate therisk of malnutrition in the context of low-protein intake, suchas sarcopenia, cachexia, active in ﬂammatory or infectious
diseases, periods of hospitalization or the early postoperativeperiod, poorly controlled diabetes, consumptive diseases such
as cancer, treatment of antibiotic or immunosuppressive
medications, and signi ﬁcant short-term loss of body weight.
Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence was moder-
ate that there was little to no difference in the critical outcome ofall-cause death and kidney failure prevention when comparingvery low –protein to low- or normal-protein diets, and moderate
that there was some bene ﬁt to the critical outcome of kidney
failure for the comparison of very low –protein diets with low- or
normal-protein diets as demonstrated by the wide CIs for theseoutcomes including potential for important bene ﬁts and harms.
In addition, there was important and unexplained heterogeneitypresent. It is uncertain whether low- or very low –protein diets
impact a change in GFR.
The certainty of evidence was very low when comparing low-
protein to normal-protein diets for a change in GFR and low whencomparing very low –protein to low- or normal-protein diets. This
is because the CIs included potential for important bene ﬁts and
harms. There was important and unexplained heterogeneitypresent; the outcome was reported as a surrogate outcome; andthere was unclear allocation concealment in 4 studies.
The overall certainty of evidence for the remaining out-
comes was very low because of increased risk of bias andsmall studies with wide CIs. In addition, many studies wereunclear about allocation concealment/random sequence
generation, and had signi ﬁcant, unexplained heterogeneity,
wide CIs for important bene ﬁts and harms, and use of sur-
rogate outcomes.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that some
clinically suitable people would choose to implement a diet
with protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d unless there areconditions that contraindicate such as sarcopenia, cachexia,or undernutrition. In addition, the Work Group judged that
protein restriction would be implemented by many people as
a way of managing their kidney disease. It will also have animpact on overall QoL with the adoption of a more plant-based diet; however, there may be challenges with imple-menting and adhering to these changes.
Resource use and costs. The risks, bene ﬁts, resource use,
and costs of dietary protein interventions should be consid-ered when treating people with CKD. The Work Group
considered that plant-based proteins could have a cost-bene ﬁt
effect compared with animal-based protein, but evidence in
this topic remains limited.
Considerations for implementation. Protein restriction
without support and advice from renal dietitians or otheraccredited nutrition providers may result in low dietary di-versity and limited food choices, adversely impacting QoLand altering fundamental components of a person ’s culture
and daily life. The use of culturally appropriate foods that aremore familiar to people, nutritional status, goals of care, QoL,and patient preferences should be considered in the imple-mentation of these recommendations and practice points.
Rationale
The Work Group suggests dietary protein interventions basedon consideration of the possible bene ﬁts of plant-based foods,
kidney protection, and avoidance of adverse effect of unsu-pervised protein restriction. People with CKD not on dialysiswith or without diabetes may opt for some degree of dietaryprotein moderation, especially as control of dietary intakechapter 3 www.kidney-international.org
S210 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
empowers people with CKD and supports self-care manage-
ment. People put a large value on diet, cultural preferences,and QoL; however, adherence to a low-protein diet remainschallenging, may impact social and psychological well-being,
and given that most of the trials for protein restriction were
conducted before RASi and SGLT2i were implemented, maynot be worth the sacri ﬁce/change in lifestyle. The impact of
protein restriction and the use of non –animal-based protein
diets should be evaluated in the context of new care para-digms to ascertain the incremental gain of these strategiesrelative to the efforts and costs.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake inchildren with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment.
The target protein and energy intake in children with CKD
G2–G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for
healthy children to promote optimal growth.
Children with CKD likely have similar resting energy
expenditure to healthy children and should have total energyrequirements in the normal range.
483As in adults, protein
restriction was considered for children with CKD in the past.Two RCTs have compared low-protein versus normal-protein
diets in children with CKD.
484,485One found poorer growth
for those on a low-protein diet, and the other found no
difference in eGFR between the groups. A 2007 Cochranemeta-analysis concluded that there was uncertainty over thepossible harm of strict low-protein diets on growth in younginfants.
486The 2009 KDOQI guidelines and the 2020 Pediatric
Renal Nutrition Taskforce suggest maintaining an intake ofdietary protein at 100% –140% of the dietary reference intake
(DRI) or the SDI for ideal body weight in children with CKDG3 and at 100% –120% of the DRI/SDI in children with CKD
G4–G5.
487,488
Older adults.
Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlyingconditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higherprotein and calorie dietary targets.
In older adults with CKD, nutritional management should
consider potential challenges stemming from simultaneousand potentially con ﬂicting risks of CKD progression and
malnutrition/protein-energy wasting. In older adults, proteintargets should be set after careful individual assessment to
identify the most urgent clinical challenge.
Geriatric guidelines recommend protein intakes of 1.0 –1.2 g/
kg body weight/d to prevent age-related malnutrition and pre-
vent sarcopenia.
489Such protein intakes may be appropriate in
some people with stable or slowly progressing CKD, whoseclinical picture is dominated by old age and related challengesto their nutritional and functional status. On the other hand,protein restriction may be appropriate in older adults whose
primary clinical challenge is CKD with signi ﬁcant progression,
provided they are metabolically stable.
490The course of action
should consider patient preferences and when necessary,
involve family members and caregivers.3.3.2 Sodium intake
The Work Group concurs with the following recommenda-tion from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease
23and the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for theManagement of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease .
21
Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium
intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of
sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day)
in people with CKD ( 2C).
Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually
not appropriate for patients with sodium-wastingnephropathy.
Global average sodium intake is estimated to be 4310 mg/
d (10.78 g of salt per day), which far exceeds the physiologicalrequirement and is more than double the WHO recommenda-
tion of <2 g of sodium (equivalent to <5 g of salt) per day in
adults.
491This perhaps re ﬂects the pervasive use of sodium in
many commercial food products, which makes achieving
WHO targets challenging to meet for many people. There arelarge-scale RCTs quantifying the bene ﬁts of restricted salt
intake (e.g., using 75% sodium and 25% potassium chloridesalt substitutes) to lower BP and reduce the risk ofcardiovascular events in the general population.
492In RCTs
with up to 36 weeks of follow-up, reduction in dietary sodiumhas also been shown to lower BP and levels of albuminuria inpeople with CKD.
492–494Although presumed to reduce the risk
of CKD progression and CVD, longer term trials have notbeen conducted to con ﬁrm these effects translate into reduced
r i s ko fc l i n i c a lo u t c o m e si nC K D .
493Given the effects of
sodium restriction on BP , it is reasonable to recommendsodium restriction to people with CKD in combination with
pharmacological strategies to minimize the risk of kidney and
CVDs. People with CKD may have salt-wasting kidney disease,malnutrition, or be exposed to extremely hot climaticconditions. In such scenarios, this recommendation may notapply.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based RecommendedDaily Intake when counseling about sodium intake forchildren with CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood
pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height.
The WHO recommends that the maximum intake of <2g / d
sodium ( <5 g/d salt) in adults should be adjusted downward
based on the energy requirements of children relative to those
of adults ( Table 22
495). Children born with low birth weight
(<2.5 kg) are at increased risk for CKD in later life and may
also be at higher risk for hypertension and increased saltsensitivity. Salt sensitivity is a physiological trait by which BP
in some people exhibits changes parallel to changes in salt
intake. Children born with low birth weight may have a 37%increased salt sensitivity (de ﬁn e da sa ni n c r e a s ei nm e a nB Pwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S211
$3 mm Hg over 24 hours while on a high salt diet, when
compared with a controlled salt diet). That sensitivity may
increase further in those who are small for gestational age.496
Children with CKD often have underlying tubular condi-
tions that predispose them to numerous electrolyte losses,including sodium. For these children, a supplemented ratherthan restricted sodium intake will be required. For non –salt-
wasting children, salt intake should be limited to the age-based Recommended Daily Intake.
3.4 Blood pressure control
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure inChronic Kidney Disease , which encourages individualized BP
targets and use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, andother comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and toleranceto treatments.
21We highlight the following guidance:
Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults
with high BP and CKD be treated with a target
systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg,
when tolerated, using standardized of ﬁce BP
measurement (2B).
Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering
therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and frac-
tures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic posturalhypotension.
RCTs have not demonstrated that intensive BP-lowering
results in meaningful reductions in the risk of kidney failure,but the RCT evidence supporting important cardiovascularbeneﬁts should encourage such a strategy. By aiming for an SBP
<120 mm Hg, more adults with CKD will achieve an SBP
<130 mm Hg, even if they do not meet the <120 mm Hg
t a r g e t .O b s e r v a t i o n a l l y ,o na v e r a g e ,e a c h2 0m mH gh i g h e rt h a nusual SBP and 10 mm Hg higher diastolic BP is associated withan approximate doubling of cardiovascular risk, with no lowerlimit down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.
497Data from the Systolic
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) support the SBPtarget of <120 mm Hg (when measured using a standardized
ofﬁce BP measurement) to reduce cardiovascular risk in
adults aged >75 years, or aged >50 years with 1 or more of
the following risk factors: clinical or subclinical CVD (otherthan stroke), eGFR 20 –60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2,o r$ 15% 10-
year cardiovascular risk.498Compared with a target of 140
mm Hg, this approach reduces the risk of major adversecardiovascular events (MACE) by one-quarter (hazard ratio[ H R ] :0 . 7 5 ;9 5 %C I :0 . 6 4 –0.89), and that relative bene ﬁtw a s
similar in people with and without CKD. The SPRINT trialexcluded people with diabetes, but cardiovascular bene ﬁts of
intensive BP lowering on risk of stroke and heart failure areclearly apparent in people with diabetes in individual patientlevel data meta-analysis of intensive versus standard BP-lowering trials.
499
Standardized BP monitoring can be challenging to offer in a
clinic setting due to the time required500;h o w e v e r ,i ti s
considered potentially hazardous to apply the recommendedSBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a
nonstandardized manner.
500A practical solution to ensure the
identi ﬁcation of high BP is by using home-based monitoring
(or telemonitoring). Trials have shown that 2 morning andevening BP measurements taken during the ﬁrst week of every
month can be used to titrate antihypertensive medication andreduce BP more than “usual care ”approaches.
501
People who are frail, have limited life expectancy, or have a
history of falls and fractures may have increased risk of addi-
tional events if BP targets of <120 are achieved. Postural
hypotension in these people is associated with adverse out-
comes, and thus weighing the bene ﬁts of some attenuation of
eGFR decline versus the life-changing impact of falls, fractures,and other events should be considered in choosing speci ﬁc
targets.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. The Work Group concurs with the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Managementof Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease , and we high-
light the following guidance
21:
Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children
with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
should be lowered to £50th percentile for age, sex,
and height (2C).
Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM
and every 3– 6 months with standardized auscultatory of ﬁce
BP in children with CKD.
Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is
not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatoryofﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized
setting, of 50th –75th percentile for age, sex, and height
unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptomsof hypotension.
These statements with respect to children are generally
worded to maintain consistency with the KDIGO 2021Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of BloodPressure in Chronic Kidney Disease,
21where the full rationale
and evidence behind the statements are available. However,
the suggestion to target auscultatory of ﬁce SBP at the 50th –
75th percentile when ABPM is not available departs fromTable 22 | Age-based sodium intake recommendations495
Age Recommended adequate sodium intake (g/d)

the BP guideline (the previous guideline suggested a target
<90th percentile). Although of ﬁce BP may be higher than
BP measured by ABPM, this is not universally the case.Given the evidence that intensive BP control may slow CKD
progression together with the very low risk of adverse
effects of intensive BP lowering in children,
228we consider
that more intensive BP lowering targeting around the 50thpercentile is reasonable. However, a target even lower thanthe 50th percentile has not been shown to offer additionalbeneﬁts. Recent trial data found that using a target of of ﬁce
auscultatory SBP at 50th to 75th percentile versus intensivecontrol to below the 40th percentile did not result in
signiﬁcant differences in left ventricular mass index.

3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
The Work Group highlights recommendations from the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Managementof Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected
practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021
Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of BloodPressure in Chronic Kidney Disease
21and the KDIGO 2022
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management inChronic Kidney Disease .
23The Work Group considers
several recommendations to apply even in the absence ofhigh BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BPguideline to remove this requirement. Key recommendationsand practice points are highlighted:
Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting
renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angio-
tensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or
angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for peoplewith CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1 –
G4, A3) without diabetes (1B).
Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEior ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increasedalbuminuria (G1 –G4, A2) without diabetes (2C).
Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend startingRASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD andmoderately-to-severely increased albuminuria
(G1–G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B).
Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding
any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin in-hibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or
without diabetes (1B).Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be
administered using the highest approved dose that is
tolerated to achieve the bene ﬁts described because the
proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses.
Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine,
and serum potassium should be checked within 2 –4
weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi,depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.
Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use
of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the
serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the doseor stopping RASi.
Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy
unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within
4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increasein dose.
Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or dis-
continuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symp-tomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemiadespite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms
while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltra-
tion rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m
2).
Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD
with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi
(ACEi or ARB) for speci ﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hyper-
tension or heart failure with low ejection fraction).
The role of RASi (speci ﬁcally ACEi or ARB) in the manage-
ment of BP and people with CKD, diabetes, and/or high BP havebeen speci ﬁcally considered in recent KDIGO guidelines.
21,23
Although temporarily stopping RASi may be a valid treatmentstrategy for emergent hyperkalemia, we advise to ensure the
reinitiation of treatments once the adverse event is resolved, so
that people are not deprived of a needed medication (PracticePoint 4.3.3).
502–506The Work Group offers the new Practice
Point 3.6.6 and a revised algorithm for initiation of RASi(Figure 21 ).
23The algorithm has been updated to suggest a
$30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine)
should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying othercondition. This represents a threshold above which the eGFR
change is greater than would be expected from natural
variation. Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intakemay help ensure maximal effects of RASi.
Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people
with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per1.73 m
2.
In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean
eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing
RASi in CKD G4 –G5 did not result in any kidney or car-
diovascular bene ﬁts.507Two observational studies have also
found that associations suggesting outcomes were worseamong participants who stopped RASi after reaching anwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S213
eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, compared with those who
continue.508,509In addition, a recent individual patient level
data meta-analysis demonstrated a bene ﬁt in delaying KRT
in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.510
3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT2i)
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic
Kidney Disease , which stated: “We recommend treating pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/
min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A).”23However, in this
guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation foradults with CKD. We also highlight practice points fromthe KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management inCKD, which are also relevant for people with CKD withoutdiabetes:
Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an
eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m
2with an SGLT2i (1A).
Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is
reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR fallsbelow 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,unless it is not tolerated
or KRT is initiated.Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2iduring times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or criticalmedical illness (when people may be at greater risk for
ketosis).
Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating
adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following
(1A):
/C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200
mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or
/C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria.
Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not
necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring andthe reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generallynot an indication to discontinue therapy.
Use of SGLT2i in people with T2D is recommended in previous
guidelines irrespective of level of albuminuria. This new recom-mendation (3.7.2) places high value on the importance of reducingrisk of kidney failure, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failurein people with CKD and high value on the large relative reductionsin risk for kidney disease progression in a series of large, placebo-controlled RCTs. It also places moderate value on the bene ﬁts of
SGLT2i on risk of AKI, hospitalization for heart failure and
myocardial infarction, risk of hospitalization from any cause,
and high value on the demonstrable net absolute bene ﬁts
versus absolute harms in people with CKD (particularly in thoseInitiate ACEi or ARB

without diabetes who are at very low risk of ketoacidosis). SGLT2i
also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, measures of ﬂuid over-
load, the risk of serious hyperkalemia, and do not increase risk of
hypoglycemia. The recommendation is consistent with but ex-
pands on Recommendation 1.3.1 from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kid-ney Disease to include people with causes of CKD not related to
diabetes .
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. Beneﬁ ts.Several large, pla-
cebo-controlled RCTs have provided clear demonstrations ofthe ef ﬁcacy of SGLT2i, which substantially reduce the risk of
kidney failure, AKI, and hospitalization for heart failure, andalso moderately reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and
myocardial infarction in people with and without CKD. These
beneﬁts appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of
kidney disease, or level of GFR.
511,512The bene ﬁts of SGLT2i
in people with diabetes and CKD have been fully described inthe KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Kidney Disease.
23
Two large RCTs using 2 different SGLT2i recruited 10,913
participants and focused on CKD populations at risk of
progression, reporting bene ﬁts in terms of kidney diseaseprogression.403,513Key differences between the 2 trials were
the inclusion of a large number of causes of kidney disease
not related to diabetes, lower eGFR, and lower levels of
ACR in The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With
Empagli ﬂozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) compared with the
Dapagli ﬂozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in
Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial.
In a collaborative metanalysis including those 2 and 11
other trials (13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized par-ticipants) in comparison with placebo, those allocated to anSGLT2i experienced a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney
disease progression and a 23% reduction in the risk of AKI
irrespective of diabetes status ( Figure 22 ).
511
The same meta-analysis showed that, compared with pla-
cebo, allocation to an SGLT2i reduced the risk of the com-posite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heartfailure by 23% irrespective of diabetes status (Figure 23
511),
although there were limited numbers of cardiovascularevents in people with CKD without diabetes. SGLT2i also
afford an approximate 10% RR reduction in MACE,
primarily from reduced risk of cardiovascular death andmyocardial infarction with no clear effect on stroke.
511,512
Furthermore, SGLT2i also importantly reduce the risk of
hospitalization from any cause,403reduce BP ,403,513,514uricMean

Harms. SGLT2i are well tolerated with high levels of
adherence in the RCTs in CKD.403,513,514In the studied
populations, any risk of ketoacidosis or lower-limb
amputation resulting from SGLT2i use was substantially
lower than the potential absolute bene ﬁts and generally
restricted to people with diabetes. Meta-analysis estimates of
absolute bene ﬁts and harms for each 1000 people with
CKD and T2D treated for 1 year with an SGLT2i were 11fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heartfailure, for approximately 1 episode of ketoacidosis andapproximately 1 lower-limb amputation, respectively (andalso 11 fewer people developing kidney disease progression
and 4 fewer people with AKI). The corresponding bene ﬁts
in people with CKD without diabetes were 15 fewer people
with kidney disease progression, 5 fewer with AKI, and 2fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heartfailure per 1000 patient-years of treatment with no excessrisk of ketoacidosis or amputation observed.
511The vast
majority of urinary tract infections in people taking SGLT2iare not caused by SGLT2 inhibition, and there is noincreased risk of hypoglycemia. There is an increased risk ofmycotic genital infections (in men and women), but theseare generally mild and treating these infections with low-cost topical agents should help treatment adherence.
Certainty of evidence. SGLT2i have been studied in a
series of large trials with consistent effects observed be-tween trials, using different agents in the class. The trialshave robust double-blind designs that minimize risk ofbias, and they have provided precise estimates of effectwith no risk of publication bias due to the Nuf ﬁeld
Department of Public Health (NDPH) Renal StudiesGroup and SGLT2 inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-RenalTrialists ’Consortium (SMART) collaboration, which
brought together all the trialists that have conducted therelevant large trials. The totality of the evidence provideshigh levels of certainty of ef ﬁcacy, with larger effect sizes
observed in many populations. Relative effects on kidneydisease progression appeared to be larger among peoplewith higher levels of albuminuria who are at highest ab-solute risk of progression. The size of RR reductionsMean

appears to be irrespective of the level of GFR, with no
evidence of a threshold level of eGFR below which ben-eﬁts start to attenuate.
For the 1A recommendation (3.7.1), also see the 2022
update to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline in DiabetesManagement for details of the certainty of the evidence.
23Our
ERT speci ﬁcally also undertook a systematic review limited to
people with CKD and no diabetes and considered thecertainty of the effect in this subgroup to be moderate. TheERT identi ﬁed the collaborative meta-analysis,
511which
included data from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2i amongadults with CKD without diabetes.
403,513Both RCTs were
considered to have a low risk of bias. The collaborativemeta-analysis harmonized the de ﬁnition of CKD
progression among the trials. The certainty of the evidencefor CKD progression was graded as high (no concernsregarding the risk of bias of the studies or the consistency,directness, and precision of the results). The certainty of theevidence for the kidney failure outcome in people withCKD without diabetes was downgraded to moderate due to
imprecision (although clear bene ﬁts are demonstrated in
the CKD trials: Figure 24
518). Neither RCT reported on the
critical outcome of hospitalizations for any cause in the
subgroup without diabetes.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that fully
informed people with CKD with an indication for anSGLT2i would choose to receive SGLT2i for their provenbeneﬁts on risk of CKD progression, AKI, and a range of
cardiovascular outcomes, their generally good safety pro ﬁle,
and simplicity to implement (assuming local availabilityand insurance coverage if required). SGLT2i also conferhealth bene ﬁts that may motivate people with CKD due tothe reduced risk of hospitalization and serious hyper-kalemia and uric acid levels, all of which are commonCKD complications.
Resource use and costs. Because of the high cost of KRT,
SGLT2i have been found to be cost-saving in the people withCKD and diabetes recruited in the completed trials.
519
Generic SGLT2i are already available in some countries.From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the costburden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable,and QoL may be preserved longer from their avoidance.Speci ﬁcs as to whether people bear the costs of these
medications will be country-dependent.
Considerations for implementation. The Work Group
considered it safe to continue or even initiate an SGLT2iwhen the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m
2and
continue their use until the time KRT is initiated (as wasthe approach used in the large CKD populationRCTs
403,513,514). We also considered that initiating SGLT2i
does not necessitate alteration of frequency of laboratorymonitoring. It is not routinely necessary to recheck blood
tests after initiating an SGLT2i in adults with CKD (see
Practice Point 3.7.3).
403
Reduced glomerular hyper ﬁltration resulting from
SGLT2i can result in a dip in eGFR which is reversible.None of the large trials demonstrated an increased risk ofAKI in people treated with SGLT2i (Figure 22 ), and the
intervention does not induce hyperkalemia (an importantdifference compared with inhibitors of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, which generally require
additional monitoring after initiation [Figure 21 ]).
Note that adults with polycystic kidney disease were
excluded from the large CKD trials testing SGLT2i.Mean

Rationale
Large trials individually and when combined in meta-analysis
demonstrate clear net bene ﬁts of SGLT2i, with net bene ﬁts
particularly large in people without diabetes due to almost norisk of serious harm from ketoacidosis or lower-limb ampu-tation.
Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults
with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m
2with urine
ACR<200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i
(2B).
This recommendation places high value on the potential for long-
term use of SGLT2i in people without diabetes who have a sub-stantially decreased GFR to reduce the risk of kidney failure butrecognizes remaining uncertainty in this population due to the
short follow-up in the RCTs. It also places moderate value on the
beneﬁts of SGLT2i on risk of AKI, cardiovascular death and
myocardial infarction, and risk of hospitalization from any cause.SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, ﬂuid overload,
and the risk of serious hyperkalemia. Note that a person with CKDand heart failure has a clear indication for the use of SGLT2i toreduce risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heartfailure irrespective of level of albuminuria ( Figure 24 ).
Key information
Bene ﬁts and harms. Several large placebo-controlled RCTs
have provided clear demonstrations of the ef ﬁcacy of SGLT2i,
which substantially reduce the risk of kidney disease progressionand kidney failure ( Figures 22 and24)a sw e l la sm o d e r a t e l y
reduce the risk of CVD events ( Figure 23 ) in people with and
without CKD. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the kidney
disease progression outcome subdivided by primary kidney
diagnosis demonstrated that there was no signi ﬁcant subgroup
interaction by primary kidney diagnosis, and SGLT2i reducedthe risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes(Figure 22 ).
511SGLT2i also reduce the risk of hospitalization
for any cause in people with CKD.403,520Some uncertainty
remains about the effects on kidney disease progression inpeople without diabetes with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/
mmol), which led to a different grading of therecommendation for that population. EMPA-KIDNEY was thekey trial to assess effects in people with CKD at risk ofprogression with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) and
found evidence of signi ﬁcant interaction by ACR status for its
primary outcome (trend P¼0.02). Relative effects appeared to
be larger in people with higher levels of albuminuria. The slowrate of progression and small number of outcomes in the A1
subgroup limited the power for EMPA-KIDNEY to assess
effects on the primary outcome in this subgroup. There were,however, important effects on the chronic (i.e., long-term)slope in all albuminuria subgroups, and signi ﬁcant reductions
in progression using total slope analyses over the 2 years offollow-up in the A2 and A3 groups were considered separately(Figure 25
403).
Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for
the ef ﬁcacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with
CKD without diabetes is moderate (see Supplementary Table
S1023,403,511,518,521–524). The ERT identi ﬁed an individual
participant data (IPD) meta-analysis,511which included data
from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor among adultswith CKD but not diabetes.
403,513Both RCTs were considered
to have a low risk of bias. The IPD meta-analysis harmonizedthe de ﬁnition of CKD progression among the trials. The
certainty of the evidence for CKD progression was graded as
high as there were no concerns regarding the risk of bias of
the studies or the consistency, directness, and precision of theresults. The certainty of the evidence for kidney failure wasdowngraded to moderate due to imprecision.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that fully
informed adults without diabetes and low levels of albuminuria(urine ACR <200 mg/g [< 20 mg/mmol]) who have established
CKD and an eGFR of 20 –45 ml/min per 1.73 m
2may be
particularly motivated to take SGLT2i for the bene ﬁts identi ﬁed
on rate of decline in GFR as they already have substantiallyreduced GFR. Adults with established CKD are highly likely towant to start treatment early to maximize bene ﬁts. Extrapola-
tion of the ﬁndings from eGFR slope analyses (Figure 25 ) could
mean substantial delays in any future requirement for KRT.People with CKD may also be motivated by the potential forSGLT2i to reduce risk of AKI, hospitalization, serious
hyperkalemia, ﬂuid overload, and uric acid levels, all of which
are common CKD complications.
Resource use and costs. Health economic analyses are
required in people with CKD without diabetes and low levels
of albuminuria to establish their level of cost-effectiveness.From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the costburden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable, andQoL may be preserved longer from their avoidance. Speci ﬁcs
as to whether people bear the costs of these medications willbe country-dependent.
Considerations for implementation.. The considerations for
implementation in people with CKD and low levels of albu-minuria are no different to people with albuminuria (seeabove for details).
Rationale
Large trials considered individually and combined in meta-analysis demonstrate clear net bene ﬁts of SGLT2i, but ev-
idence for bene ﬁts on CKD progression in people without
diabetes and with low levels of albuminuria is limited toeGFR slope analyses in heart failure trials and one CKDtrial all with relatively short follow-up periods. However,extrapolation of these eGFR slope results suggests thatimportant bene ﬁts would accrue for such people if treated
long term.chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org

Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. SGLT2i have not been tested in
clinical trials on children with kidney disease. Limited
observational data and phase II trial data exist for childrenwith and without kidney disease. Four studies (99 childrenand young adults with diabetes and normal GFR) found that
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were likely to be
the same in children and adults.
525–528Recent work modeled
pediatric dapagli ﬂozin dosing for smaller children based on
known pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.483Side
effects reported from the prior studies included an increasein glycosuria and infrequent reporting of nausea, genitalinfection, dehydration, and abdominal pain. In an RCT,there were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and similar
numbers of hypoglycemia between placebo and
dapagli ﬂozin, mostly occurring in those on insulin.
529There is limited research on kidney effects of SGLT2i in
children. One study of 8 children with CKD and proteinuriafound a reduction in 24-hour urine protein from a mean of 2.1g/d to a mean of 1.5 g/d over 12 weeks.
530Theoretically, the
glycosuric effect of SGLT2i may lead to a negative caloriebalance, interfering with optimal growth, especially in smallchildren with underlying growth retardation. Clinical trials inthe pediatric population are suggested, including in thosewith speci ﬁc etiologies and at different age groups (i.e.,
prepubescent, peripubescent, and postpubescent).

Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven
kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for adults with T2D,
an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, normal serum
potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( >30 mg/
g[>3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose
of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).
Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are mostappropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk ofCKD progression and cardiovascular events, asdemonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other
standard-of-care therapies.
Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added
to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD
in adults.
Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyper-
kalemia, select people with consistently normal serumpotassium concentration and monitor serum potassium
regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA
(Figure 26 ).
Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA
should prioritize agents with documented kidney or
cardiovascular bene ﬁts.
Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for
treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or re-
fractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or areversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly
among people with a low GFR.
MRAs reduce BP and albuminuria in people with CKD
531
and are part of recommended care for heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction.532The large Finerenone in
Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in DiabeticKidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD)
533and Finerenone in
Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in DiabeticKidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD)
534placebo-controlled trials
and their pooled analysis (FIDELITY)535demonstrated thatthe nonsteroidal MRA (ns-MRA) ﬁnerenone reduced
cardiovascular risk in people with CKD and T2D (HR: 0.86;95% CI: 0.78 –0.95). The bene ﬁt was in large part due to a
22% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure(HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66 –0.92), with no clear effect on stroke
(Figure 27 ).
535These trials have some limitations on their
generalizability to all people with CKD at risk of progression,given that study participants had an eGFR of $25 ml/min
per 1.73 m
2and an ACR of $30 mg/g ( $3m g / m m o l ) ,a n d
that people without diabetes were excluded.
Whether based on laboratory data or investigator reports,
ﬁnerenone approximately doubled the RR of hyperkalemia
compared with controls. However, risks were generally lowand average increase in serum potassium was approximately0.2–0.3 mEq from baseline values. The low absolute baseline
risk of hyperkalemia may be due to the selection of partic-ipants with serum potassium <4.8 mmol/l and careful
algorithmic monitoring of potassium during follow-up.Speci ﬁc analyses of FIDELIO-DKD reported that 2.3% and
11.0% of participants in the ﬁnerenone group withdrew or
interrupted treatment due to hyperkalemia (de ﬁned as
serum potassium >5.5 mmol/l), respectively, versus
0.9% and 5.2% for the placebo group.
535Overall, in
FIDELITY, permanent treatment withdrawal forhyperkalemia was 1.7% versus 0.6%. Hospitalization for
serious hyperkalemia was relatively rare with a <1% excess
risk over 3 years.
536Finerenone was also otherwise
generally well-tolerated with no excess risk for serious AKI
identi ﬁed in the 2 large trials. Further details are available
in the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline forDiabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.
23
Trials assessing the effect of combining an SGLT2i and
ﬁnerenone compared with either alone are ongoing (Clin-
icalTrials.gov Identi ﬁer: NCT05254002 ). Adequately pow-
ered, large-scale, clinical outcome, placebo-controlled trials
of steroidal and ns-MRAs have not been conducted inpeople with causes of CKD not related to diabetes, but areongoing.

3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1 RA)
The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice
point from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .23
Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD
who have not achieved individualized glycemic
targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhib-itor treatment, or who are unable to use those
medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA
(1B).
Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA shouldprioritize agents with documented cardiovascular
beneﬁts.Results of the FLOW trial assessing effects of GLP-1 RA in
a dedicated CKD population are awaited. It is a de ﬁnitive
assessment of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in 3534
people with CKD, albuminuria, and T2D.
537aNevertheless,
extrapolating current evidence from trials in people withT2D where kidney function was generally preserved
suggests GLP-1 RA safely improve glycemic control and
may reduce weight and risk of CVD in people withCKD.
23,538Meta-analysis of these large, placebo-controlled
cardiovascular outcome GLP-1 RA trials has shown reducedMACE in people with prior CVD or at high risk.
538The
size of RR reductions on cardiovascular risk appears similarin people with or without decreased GFR.
538Once
aggregated, GLP-1 RAs were shown to have modestly
reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.89;
95% CI: 0.82 –0.92) and separately reduced risk of death
from any cause (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82 –0.94).538The
KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Kidney Disease has recommendedthat long-acting GLP-1 RAs are prioritized ahead of insulinin people with T2D and CKD. GLP-1 RAs with provenOutcome Finerenone (n = 6519) Placebo (n = 6507) Hazard ratio

CKD include liraglutide, semaglutide (injectable), and
dulaglutide.23
3.10 Metabolic acidosis
As GFR decreases, the kidney ’s ability to excrete hydrogen
ions and generate bicarbonate decreases, resulting in thedevelopment of chronic metabolic acidosis. Metabolicacidosis is observationally associated with increased risk ofprotein catabolism, muscle wasting, in ﬂammation, and other
complications such as impaired cardiac function and mor-tality that are also associated with decreased eGFR.
539,540The
causality of such associations remains to be demonstrated.
Deﬁnition and prevalence. Serum bicarbonate concentration
begins to fall progressively once eGFR falls below 60 ml/minper 1.73 m2with reductions most evident in CKD stages G4 –
G5 ( Figure 28 ,541Table 23 ). The adjusted adult prevalence of
serum bicarbonate <22 mmol/l was 7.7% and 6.7% in those
with and without diabetes at stage G3, A1, respectively,
increasing to 38.3% and 35.9% by CKD stage G5, A3.
Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of
pharmacological treatment with or without dietary inter-vention to prevent development of acidosis with potentialclinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/l
in adults).
Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic
acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonateconcentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal anddoes not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, orﬂuid status.
The Work Group has not provided a graded recommen-
dation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scaleRCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was
justiﬁed because alkali supplementation may be a promising
low-cost, high-bene ﬁt adjunct treatment for people with CKD
and may be accessible to all populations. This was based on an
RCT that had suggested potential kidney disease progressionand nutritional bene ﬁts with no important increase in BP or
heart failure complications.
1However, since 2012, a number
of trials testing the hypothesis that sodium bicarbonatetherapy would slow kidney disease progression have been
reported, including several employing placebo control. A
2021 systematic review identi ﬁed 15 trials with $3 months
of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per
1.73 m
2and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral
sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no studymedication on kidney outcomes. Of the 15 trials (2445participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 werepublished since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains
limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analysis
restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not con ﬁrm
any important modifying effect of oral sodium bicarbonateversus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.54–1.22).

older people with chronic kidney disease and low-grade
acidosis (BiCARB) Study Group.543It contributed 33 of 152
versus 33 of 148 kidney failure outcomes to the meta-analysis in its bicarbonate versus placebo arms, respectively
(HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64 –1.49). Importantly, the BiCARB
trial, which studied people with CKD G3 –G4 aged $60
years and sodium bicarbonate concentration <22 mmol/l,
also found no evidence of bene ﬁt on nonkidney outcomes
to support oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (the
primary outcome was based on the Short PhysicalPerformance Battery at 12 months, and secondary outcomesincluded generic and disease-speci ﬁc QoL assessments,
anthropometry, kidney function, walk distance, BP, andbone and vascular health markers). Allocation to oralsodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs andlower European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 LevelVersion (EQ-5D-3L) assessed QoL over 1 year.
543
Licensed non-alkali oral interventions may be an alterna-
tive to oral sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis buthave not been shown to have particular advantages.
544,545
Although placebo-controlled trials have found no goodevidence that correcting sodium bicarbonate levels hasimportant effects on clinical outcomes, the Work Groupconcluded that the intervention is clearly effective atincreasing serum bicarbonate concentration and is asuitable treatment to avoid more severe acidosis withpotential for clinical implications. The Work Group suggeststhat a serum bicarbonate of <18 mmol/l in adults is
desirable to avoid, but large RCTs are required to determinea precise threshold whereby the treatment of low serumbicarbonate levels leads to improvements in clinicaloutcome. As correction of bicarbonate to the normal rangehas not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidneyfailure, lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/lcould be considered (see Research Recommendations ).
Dietary approaches. Dietary modi ﬁcations that limit the
consumption of acid-rich foods and/or increase the intake ofalkaline-rich foods reduce the net endogenous acid productionand can serve as an additional strategy to control metabolicacidosis in people with CKD.
546,547Such diets are generally low
in animal protein or have a higher consumption of plant-basedfoods over animal-based foods (i.e., plant-dominant diets suchas Mediterranean or vegetarian diets). Four small RCTs ofalkaline-rich plant-based diets in adults with CKDdemonstrate a comparable bene ﬁtt oo r a ls o d i u m
bicarbonate in controlling metabolic acidosis.
548–551
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. As in adults, children with CKD
often have metabolic acidosis. In the CKiD and the Cardio-
vascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease
Study (4C) studies, 38% –60% of children had a serum bicar-
bonate of <22 mmol/l, varying by CKD category. Low bicar-
bonate was associated with increased risk of diseaseprogression.
395,552It should also be noted that for younger
children, the normal range for sodium bicarbonate is as lowas 17 mmol/l. In children, metabolic acidosis is also likely tocause growth retardation. Data from the observational CKiD
study revealed that prepubertal children with acidosis who
were treated with alkali had improved growth.
553In children
with normal GFR but renal tubular acidosis, prolongedacidosis can also result in poor growth. The KDOQIguideline on bone metabolism for children with CKDrecommends the prevention of acidosis in children tooptimize growth.
554There have not been any trials examining
the effect of bicarbonate supplementation on CKD
progression or growth in children.
3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD
Deﬁnition and prevalence. Potassium is key to cell mem-
brane electrophysiology, with abnormalities predisposing to
abnormal cardiac conduction and arrhythmias. The kidneysplay a key role in potassium homeostasis with decreased GFRgenerally associated with increased potassium concentration(Table 24 ;Figure 29
555). The de ﬁnition of hyperkalemia is
based on the distribution of potassium values in the generalpopulation. Hyperkalemia is uncommon when the eGFR is>60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2and increases with lower GFR.
Adults with CKD G3, A1 in the general and high-risk pop-
ulation cohorts, contributing to the CKD-PC, had an adjustedprevalence of hyperkalemia (de ﬁned as a serum potassium
>5.0 mmol/l) of 8.8% and 4.5% in those with and without
diabetes, respectively, increasing to 34.4% and 23.7% by CKDG5, A3 (Figure 30 ).
541Note that there is variability in the
prevalence of hyperkalemia, and it is not inevitable at lower

levels of GFR, thus understanding potassium physiology and its
impacting factors are important in effective patient care.
Hyperkalemia in people with preserved GFR is less prev-
alent. An acute episode of hyperkalemia is a potassium resultabove the upper limit of normal that is not known to bechronic. At the current time, there is no consensus on themagnitude, duration, and frequency of elevated potassiumvalues that de ﬁne chronicity.
556In addition to decreased
eGFR, other risk factors for hyperkalemia included higherACR and prior diabetes, hyperglycemia, constipation,RASi,
557and MRA.536Note that SGLT2i do not appear to
increase serum potassium values.403,517
Studies have demonstrated a continuous U-shaped rela-
tionship between serum potassium and all-cause mortalityin a range of different populations (Figure 31 ).
555,558It has
also been associated with worse kidney prognosis.559
Observationally, the risk of death from the same degree ofhyperkalemia is lower in more advanced CKD stages.
560–564
This may suggest that there are adaptive mechanisms thatrender better tolerance to elevated levels of potassium incirculation.
561,565–568
3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium
measurement
There are several factors and mechanisms that may impact on
potassium measurements, including the actions of medicationsthat can increase the risk of developing hyperkalemia. These aresummarized in Tables 25
556,569– 575and26.23,576
Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of po-tassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and
mechanisms that may in ﬂuence potassium measurement
including diurnal and seasonal variation, plasma versus
serum samples, and the actions of medications.
The Work Group would like to highlight Figure 26 for the
monitoring of serum potassium during treatment with anonsteroidal MRA (ﬁ nerenone) from the KDIGO 2022
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management inChronic Kidney Disease.

Hyperkalemia has been associated with therapeutic actions
of either reducing or stopping RASi.577–580Steps can be taken
to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia and improve potassiumcontrol that could increase the use of RASi in people with anevidenced indication. For details on how to manage hyper-kalemia associated with the use of RASi and associated

cohorts from the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, by diabetes status. Hyperkalemia is de ﬁned as potassium >5 mmol/l. The
adjusted prevalence of hyperkalemia at each estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria stage was computed as follows: ﬁrst,
the random-effects weighted adjusted mean odds at the reference point (eGFR 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2) was converted into a prevalence
estimate. To the reference estimate, the meta-analyzed odds ratios for hyperkalemia were applied to obtain prevalence estimates at eGFR 95,80, 65, 35, and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2for each stage of albuminuria. The prevalence estimates were adjusted to 60 years old, half male, non-
Black, 20% history of CVD, 40% ever smoker, and body mass index 30 kg/m2. The 25th and 75th percentiles for predicted prevalence were the
estimates from individual cohorts in the corresponding percentiles of the random-effects weighted distribution of adjusted odds. A1,albuminuria <30 mg/g (<3 mg/mmol); A2, albuminuria 30 –300 mg/g (3 –30 mg/mmol); A3, >300 mg/g (> 30 mg/mmol). Reproduced from

information on continuing RASi after hyperkalemia events.
3.11.2 Potassium exchange agents
Practice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or
formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologicmanagement of nonemergent hyperkalemia.
The pharmacologic management of nonemergent hyper-
kalemia has a number of clinical tools with the increasednumber of licensed potassium exchange agents. These med-ications have differing mechanisms of action, onsets of clin-ical effects, and potential medication and disease-state
interactions ( Table 27
581,582). Although the classic potassium
exchange agents have had tolerability issues, the newer ones
appear to have fewer such issues and appear relatively safewhen used long term.
575,583,584Use of these newer exchange
agents may help facilitate essential use of RASi/MRA.However, it is important that the healthcare provider beaware of clinical nuances and local availability or formularyrestrictions in determining therapy selection.
583A
comparison of available potassium exchange agents can befound in Table 27 .
3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moder-
ate and severe hyperkalemia in adults
“Think Kidneys ”and the UK Kidney Association have pro-
vided a practical guide, which we have adapted ( Table 28 )f o r
repeat testing after a hyperkalemic episode.585The timing of
repeat testing is guided by the level of hyperkalemia and the
clinical context.5863.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia
In people with CKD and the management of nonemergent
hyperkalemia, a systematic approach of treating correctable
factors (e.g., correction of severe metabolic acidosis) andunderstanding the role of diet and medications may providea pragmatic framework. Figure 32 shows a stepwise
practical approach to the management of hyperkalemia inCKD.
3.11.5 Dietary considerations
In early stages of CKD, high intake of foods naturally rich inpotassium appears to be protective against disease progres-sion, and dietary restriction of foods naturally containingpotassium, such as fruits and vegetables, may be harmful tocardiac health; therefore, such restriction is not endorsed.
587
Practice Point 3.11.5.1: Implement an individualizedapproach in people with CKD G3 –G5 and emergent
hyperkalemia that includes dietary and pharmacologic in-terventions and takes into consideration associatedcomorbidities and quality of life (QoL). Assessment andeducation through a renal dietitian or an accreditednutrition provider are advised.
Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of
foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods)for people with CKD G3 –G5 who have a history of
hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy during diseaseperiods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.
Diet may increase serum potassium postprandially,

medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to
hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipationare more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalitiesthan diet.
545,556,572,589Although short-term dietary
restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a validstrategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foodshighest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportiveprevention strategy for people with a history of
hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk
is a concern.

restriction may not be needed.546,556,591Although guidelines
and available information to people with CKD have heavily
emphasized plant-based foods as potential causes of
hyperkalemia in CKD,592other healthy nutrients in plant-
based foods affect potassium absorption and
distribution588,593,594; therefore, the net bioavailable
potassium from plant-based foods may be lower thanappreciated.
595Highly processed foods (rich in potassium
additives), meats, dairy products, juices, and salt substitutesmade with potassium chloride are actually higher inabsorbable potassium than many plant-based fresh foods
(Figure 33
592).596–598
Teaching materials for people with CKD should place a
greater focus on highly processed versus unprocessed food
restriction for hyperkalemia management.592An example of
a patient resource for potassium management can befound at: http://www.bcrenal.ca/resourcegallery/Documents/
Potassium_Management_in_Kidney_Disease.pdf .
Cooking methods such as soaking foods for 5 –10 minutes
in previously boiled water can effectively reduce the potas-sium by half for some foods.
599Thus, educating peoplewith CKD and healthcare providers, using clear messaging,on dietary approaches to potassium management isneeded ( https://www.theisn.org/initiatives/toolkits/raasi-toolkit/
#1684867542809-330edb79-52b4 ), as well as a policy to
improve food labeling by detailing the added potassium usedin processing.
Special considerations
International considerations. For people with CKD and
severe recurrent hyperkalemia (potassium >6 mmol/l), the
balance to be considered is between the additional cost ofthe number needed to treat with potassium exchange agentsto prevent additional costs of hyperkalemia over and aboveCKD management costs. If the price for potassium-loweringtherapy is lower than the reduction of inpatient and
outpatient costs due to prevented hyperkalemia, the cost-
beneﬁt ratio will be favorable because in addition to the
health bene ﬁts, there is a net saving of healthcare costs
resulting from potassium-lowering treatment. The key is toimplement a successful affordable strategy for hyperkalemiamanagement that allows the maintenance of other therapies3rd line:
Last resort1st line:
Address correctable factors
2nd line: 
Medications• Review non-RASi medications (e.g. NSAIDs, trimethoprim)
• Assess dietary potassium intake (dietary referral) and consider
  appropriate moderation of dietary potassium intake  
Consider:
• Appropriate use of diuretics
• Optimize serum bicarbonate levels• Licensed potassium exchange agents
• Reduce dose or discontinue RASi/MRA
  (Discontinuation is associated with increased cardiovascular events.
  Review and restart RASi or MRA at a later date if patient condition allows.)

directed at reducing both progression of CKD and reduction
in MACE.
Pediatric considerations. As described for adults with CKD,
abnormal serum potassium levels are also commonly seen in
children with advanced stages of CKD, as well as those with
glomerular disorders, metabolic acidosis, and those onRASi.
600In addition, a small group of children with CKD can
have persistent hypokalemia, usually as a result of inherited oracquired renal tubular disorders.
In children with CKD, discontinuation of RASi was asso-
ciated with an acceleration of kidney function declinecompared with a matched control cohort of children in
whom RASi were continued.
395
In children with CKD, the dietary management of potas-
sium can pose unique challenges as the provision of adequate
energy, protein, and micronutrients for growth cannot becompromised, and specialized low potassium nutritionalformulas may not be widely available or palatable.

caregivers) for potassium management can be found at:

3.12 Anemia
The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in
Chronic Kidney Disease will be updated in 2024.436
Mean hemoglobin is, on average, lower in both men and
women with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2compared
with health adults and progressively falls with decreasing GFR
(Table 29 ;Figure 34541). For example, adults with CKD G3,
A1 in the general and high-risk population cohorts
contributing to the CKD-PC had an adjusted prevalence ofanemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dl in men; <11 g/dl in women)
of 14.9% and 11.5% in those with and without diabetes,respectively, and this prevalence increased to 60.7% and57.4% by CKD G5, A3. Note that a drop in Hb is expectedin pregnancy (physiologic anemia) and may not warrant
treatment (although the cutoff at which treatment is
desirable is unclear and requires clinical judgment). Pleaserefer to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemiain Chronic Kidney Disease publications for speci ﬁc
recommendations, selection, and dosing of speci ﬁc
therapeutic agents, as well as research recommendations.3.13 CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD)

Changes in bone mineral metabolism and alterations in
calcium and phosphate homeostasis occur early in the courseof CKD and progress as eGFR declines ( Figure 35

are detectable as abnormalities of serum calcium, phosphate,vitamin D metabolites, and circulating hormones (i.e.,
parathyroid hormone [PTH] and ﬁbroblast growth factor-

extraskeletal (i.e., vascular) calci ﬁcation related to these
abnormalities of metabolism. It has been recommended
that in people with CKD G3a– G5, treatments of CKD-MBD
should be based on serial assessments of phosphate,
calcium, and PTH levels considered together.20
Higher serum phosphate concentrations are associated with
mortality,602and experimental data suggest that serum phosphate
concentration is directly related to bone disease, vascular
calciﬁcation,603,604and CVD. Low-phosphorus diets and
binders are used to help lower serum phosphate to reduce thelong-term complications of CKD-MBD, although moreresearch is needed to fully understand the disease-modifying
impact of these interventions.
605Similarly, despite evidence
suggesting no bene ﬁto nc l i n i c a lo u t c o m e s ,606vitamin D
replacement and calcimimetics to control PTH levels and to
maintain calcium within the normal range are also commonstrategies. For recommendations regarding selection and dosingwith speci ﬁc therapeutic agents and research, please see the

Kidney Disease –Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) .

3.14 Hyperuricemia
Deﬁnition and prevalence. Uric acid is the end product of the
metabolism of purine compounds, and both increased urate
production and decreased kidney excretion of uric acid can leadto hyperuricemia. The American College of Rheumatologydeﬁnes hyperuricemia as a serum uric acid concentration of
$6.8 mg/dl (approximately $400
mmol/l).607
Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) 2015 –2016 found that the crude
adult prevalence of gout (de ﬁned as self-reported, doctor
diagnosis, or uric acid –lowering therapy use) was 3.9% with a
higher prevalence in men than women (5.2% vs. 2.7%). Afteradjustment for age and sex, an eGFR consistent with CKD G3was associated with about twice the prevalence of gout (oddsratio: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.05 –3.66).
608Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people
with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be
offered uric acid –lowering intervention (1C).
The Work Group placed high value on avoiding the un-
pleasant symptoms of acute gout and preventing long-termcomplications of recurrent gout among people with CKD.There are well-tolerated and low-cost oral medications thatcan effectively lower blood uric acid concentration in peoplewith CKD.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. Systematic review of the
management of gout by the American College of Rheu-matology found strong evidence for uric acid lowering inpeople with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due togout, or frequent gout ﬂares; some of whom also had
CKD.
607
The ERT assessed the safety of uric acid –lowering therapy
and found that uric acid lowering did not increase adverseevents among people with CKD and particularly focused onrisk of cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity (pooled RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.60 –1.65) and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR:
0.92; 95% CI: 0.37 –2.30). Uric acid –lowering therapy was also
found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in people with CKD.
150,609,610This reassuring
cardiovascular safety pro ﬁle is consistent with general
population data. In the open-label Allopurinol andCardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Ischemic HeartDisease (ALL-HEART) randomized trial, 5721 people aged$60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of
gout were included. Allopurinol did not modifycardiovascular risk compared with standard care (HR forthe composite primary outcome of nonfatal myocardialinfarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death: 1.04;
95% CI: 0.89 –1.21). Findings were similar when 540 people–20020406080100120140160180Parathyroid hormone, pg/m

with an eGFR of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2at baseline (among
whom 71 primary outcomes accrued) were compared with
the 5181 people with an eGFR of $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(568 outcomes).611
Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence
for uric acid –lowering therapy among people with CKD and
hyperuricemia is very low (see Supplementary Table
S11150,612–614). The critical outcome of delaying progression
of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615–619The 2 largest
RCTs were considered to have a low risk of bias.615,616The
certainty of the evidence was downgraded for inconsistencybecause there was substantial statistical heterogeneity
detected in the meta-analysis (I
2¼50%) and the estimated
RRs ranged from 0.05 to 2.96. The certainty of the evidence
was further downgraded because of very seriousimprecision. There were 81 kidney failure events among theparticipants in the 7 trials.
The overall certainty of the evidence for delaying pro-
gression is very low, and the certainty for the critical harmoutcomes, such as cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity, and
hepatotoxicity, was graded as low. However, the certainty of
evidence for uric acid –lowering interventions in reducing
frequency and severity of gout attack, and limiting tophaceousdeposition is consistently high, so the recommendation isgiven an overall grade of level C.
Values and preferences. People with gout have reported
that they were initially hesitant to start uric acid –lowering
therapy, but that after experiencing improved control of
inﬂammatory symptoms and tophi, they became strong
advocates for its earlier institution.607
Resource use and costs. There are several generic xanthine
oxidase inhibitors that are well tolerated and widely available
at low cost.
Considerations for implementation. In most countries, the
cost and availability of uric acid –lowering therapies make
the medications very accessible. The risk of serious adverse
events (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) is related to the
presence of speci ﬁc human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
*B5801, which is more common in those of Han Chinese,Korean, Thai, and African descent. In speci ﬁc regions,
assessment of the HLA type is recommended beforecommencing the drug; where testing is not available, closemonitoring at initiation of the medication should be un-dertaken. At the current time, there is no indication to
commence medication for high serum uric acid levels in
the absence of symptoms.
Rationale
Uric acid –lowering therapy reduces uric acid levels and their
associated symptomatic joint and skin complications, and aregenerally safe to use.Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid –lowering
therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout
(particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serumuric acid concentration is >9m g / d l[ 5 3 5
mmol/l]).
Although the initiation of uric acid –lowering therapy in
people with a ﬁrst gouty arthritis episode and no tophi was
not recommended by the American College of Rheumatology,uric acid –lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated
in people with CKD G3 –G5, serum uric acid concentration
>9 mg/dl ( >535
mmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their
ﬁrst episode of gout. This was justi ﬁed by the higher risk of
gout progression and development of clinical tophi in
CKD.607The ERT evidence review identi ﬁed that uric acid –
lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout ﬂare
during the ﬁrst 3 months after initiation in people with
CKD. This is an expected short-term risk of uric acid
lowering that people should be counseled about wheninitiating such therapy. Two relatively small randomizedtrials have suggested that starting uric acid –lowering
therapy during a gout ﬂare does not appear to extend ﬂare
duration.
620,621Once initiated, the American College of
Rheumatology suggests continuing uric acid –lowering
therapy inde ﬁnitely.607
Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitorsin preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD andsymptomatic hyperuricemia.
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol and
febuxostat) reduce serum uric acid concentration by reducingpurine metabolism into uric acid. Uricosuric agents enhanceits urinary excretion (probenecid is an example), but theireffect is blunted in the context of reduced GFR. Note that theCardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Par-ticipants With Gout and Cardiovascular Comorbidities(CARES) double-blind randomized trial of allopurinol versusfebuxostat in 6190 people with gout and prior CVD found
that these 2 interventions were noninferior with respect to the
composite primary cardiovascular outcome. However, overallmortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher in thefebuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (HR for deathfrom any cause: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01 –1.47 and HR for car-
diovascular death: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03 –1.73).
622In people with
T2D, post hoc analyses from 2 large, placebo-controlled RCTs
have reported that SGLT2i reduce serum uric acid
concentration and appeared to reduce gout adverse event
reports or initiations of uric acid –lowering therapy.515,623
Observational studies suggest that diuretics (thiazide andloop) increase serum uric acid concentration.
624The effect
is mediated through multiple potential kidney-centeredmechanisms, which are summarized in a review of drug-induced hyperuricemia.
625www.kidney-international.org chapter 3
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S231
Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute
gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oralglucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs).
The American College of Rheumatology recommended that
colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids are preferred ﬁrst-line
therapies for acute gout treatment based on demonstrated highlevels of evidence for ef ﬁcacy, low cost, and tolerability.
607
Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. Forcolchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg anhour later, with ongoing anti-in ﬂammatory therapy until the
ﬂare resolves) was highlighted.
607Dose adjustment should be
considered for CKD G5. Anti-in ﬂammatory treatment may be
useful as prophylaxis against a symptomatic ﬂare when
initiating uric acid –lowering therapy and may sometimes be
required long term (without diarrhea). We have advised thatlow-dose colchicine is preferable to NSAIDs given the safetyand tolerability pro ﬁle and may also reduce risk of
cardiovascular events.
626In contrast, NSAIDs can cause toxicity
in CKD and need to be used cautiously.627Short courses of
glucocorticoids titrated to symptoms response (e.g., 30 mgprednisolone orally for 3 –5d a y s )c o u l db eu s e da sa na l t e r n a t i v e .
Dietary approaches.
Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventionswhich may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol,meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake.
High alcohol intake, high purine intake, and consumption
of carbonated drinks are associated with higher levels ofserum uric acid. Consumption of these products in higheramounts is associated with both higher levels and goutsymptoms. In contrast, diets that are low in fat and dairy, andhigh ﬁber, plant-based diets are associated with lower inci-
dence of gout. Thus, diet modi ﬁcation may be of value in
people with CKD, high uric acid, and gout.
Serum uric acid levels among people with a history of gout
are higher in those with higher versus moderate levels ofalcohol intake ($ 30 units/wk vs. <20 units/wk), as is the risk
of recurrence.
624,628The odds of gout also appear higher
among those with higher median purine intake ( $850 mg
vs.<850 mg estimated purine intake in the last 24 hours).624
Experimentally, 2 hours after ingestion of 1 g/kg of bodyweight of fructose, serum uric acid concentration increases
by 1–2m g / d l( 5 9 . 5 –119
mmol/l),629and its consumption in
carbonated drinks is observationally associated with higher
serum uric acid concentration levels,630,631and incident gout
(whereas diet versions of these drinks are not).632Foods
associated with a low incidence of gout include low-fat dairy,and high- ﬁber and plant-based diets.
633
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. There are no uric acid –lowering
trials in children.
International considerations. Asian (as opposed to African
and Caucasian) ethnicities may be at higher risk of seriousskin cutaneous reactions if they carry the HLA-B*5801 allele.
It has been suggested that HLA-B*5801 allele screening may
be considered in people who will be treated with allopurinol(although there is uncertainty that screening would be cost-
effective).
634
Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using
agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKDand asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD
progression (2D).
The Work Group judged that most well-informed people with
CKD would prefer to optimize medical therapies that have
proven bene ﬁt for CKD progression, and that the evidence does
not support treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify
risk of CKD progression.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. On balance, despite obser-
vational studies implicating elevated serum uric acid levels inthe progression of CKD, the data from systematic reviews andmultiple RCTs do not support treatment in the absence ofsymptoms. Given the pill burden and lack of data, there islittle support for the use of uric acid –lowering agents.
Observational data that implicate elevated serum uric acidlevels in the progression of CKD have not been shown to
reﬂect causal associations,
635,636as RCTs evaluating uric acid
lowering on progression of CKD do not demonstrate clear
beneﬁt on progression, including data summarized in a
Cochrane systematic review comprising 12 RCTs that hadrandomized 1187 participants.
609Since the 2017 Cochrane
review, 3 large, important RCTs with negative results havebeen conducted in people with CKD and asymptomatichyperuricemia ( Table 30 ).
615,616,637
The ERT review identi ﬁed 25 studies (26 publications) that
compared a uric acid –lowering therapy with placebo, usual
care, or another uric acid –lowering therapy among people with
CKD and hyperuricemia.150,612–619,622,637–652Twenty-two
studies (23 publications)150,612–619,622,637–652were new studies
published since the Cochrane review or were not captured bythe Cochrane 2017 review.
609We did not include 9 studies
from the Sampson et al.609review because they did not
include a separate analysis among people with CKD orbecause the study was reported as a meeting abstract only.Among people with CKD and hyperuricemia, the effects ofuric acid –lowering therapy compared with placebo or usual
care were unclear in terms of progression of kidney failure(pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.43 –1.98 for studies ranged in
follow-up from 3 months to 7 years), cutaneous reactionsand hypersensitivity (pooled RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60 –1.65),
and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37 –2.30).
Lastly, within the various therapies among people with CKDand hyperuricemia, the effects of febuxostat compared withbenzbromarone on cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivitywere unclear (RR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.01 –4.01).chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org
S232 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of the evi-
dence for uric acid –lowering therapy among people with CKD
and hyperuricemia is very low. The critical outcome of delaying
the progression of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615–619
The certainty of the evidence was downgraded forinconsistency because there was some statistical heterogeneitydetected in our meta-analysis ( Supplementary Table S12
615–619,637,638,640,642,651,653). The certainty of the evidence was
further downgraded because of very serious imprecision, asthere were few events in the trials.
Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most
well-informed people with CKD would prefer to optimizemedical therapies that have proven bene ﬁt for CKD pro-
gression, and that there is little evidence to support thetreatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify the risk
of CKD progression.
Resource use and costs. There are no cost considerations,
beyond cost-savings, in our recommendation not to use uric
acid–lowering agents.
Considerations for implementation. There are no imple-
mentation considerations in our recommendation not to useuric acid –lowering agents.Rationale
There is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend the use of uric
acid–lowering therapies in asymptomatic hyperuricemia for
the speci ﬁc purpose of delaying CKD progression. We make
the recommendation not giving uric acid –lowering therapy in
asymptomatic hyperuricemia for slowing of kidney diseasebased on the current evidence that suggests unclear bene ﬁts.
We judge that it is best practice not to expose people tomedications that provide little bene ﬁt.
3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional
speci ﬁc interventions to modify risk
Prevalence and diagnosis. People with CKD are at increased
risk of CVD,654,655a key feature of which is structural heart
disease, heart failure, and sudden death.656–658Increased risk
of atherosclerotic disease also accompanies CKD.654These
risks increase progressively as eGFR declines ( Figure 3612).4
Risk of death from CVD exceeds the risk of progression to
kidney failure for the majority of people with CKD.
The diagnosis of cardiac disease can be more complex and
challenging in CKD, with many standard tests needing carefulTable 30 | Randomized controlled trials in the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in people with CKD

consideration in people with CKD.659,660For example, exercise
electrocardiography may be limited through inability to
exercise to a diagnostic workload, or presence of microvasculardisease. Perceived risks of contrast agents may limit the use of
diagnostic imaging, thus impacting treatment choices; the risks
of contrast agents may limit the use of imaging. In addition, astrain pattern may mask diagnostic ST depression, and acutecoronary syndrome is less likely to present with classicalischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic changes than inthe general population, instead often manifesting as heartfailure symptoms or syncope.
659,660In people with GFR <60
ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR categories G3a –G5), KDIGO has
previously recommended that serum concentrations oftroponin be interpreted with caution with respect to diagnosisof acute coronary syndrome.
1More sensitive troponin assays
maintain high diagnostic accuracy in people with CKD, buthigher assay-speci ﬁc optimal cutoff levels may be
considered.
661Regardless of assay, careful attention to trends in
troponin concentration over time is required through serialmeasurement.
662
Management. In people with CKD, the same principles
should be used to manage atherosclerotic risk as in peoplewithout CKD. The level of care for CVD offered to peoplewith CKD should not be prejudiced by their GFR. Datasuggest the underuse of proven effective treatment inpeople with CKD presenting with acute coronarysyndrome.
663
Prevention of ASCVD should consider pharmaceutical,
dietary, and lifestyle intervention, which target traditionalcardiovascular risk factors (e.g., BP and dyslipidemias), aswell as CKD-MBD, which accelerates vascular calci ﬁcation
resulting in both vascular intima (resulting in increasedamounts of calcium in atherosclerotic plaques
664) and
vascular media calci ﬁcation (leading to increased vascular
stiffness).604
3.15.1 Lipid management
Dyslipidemia in CKD is frequently characterized by high tri-glycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and an increased proportion
of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are small and
oxidized.
665In adults with newly identi ﬁed CKD, it has been
recommended to evaluate their lipid pro ﬁle (total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), butfollow-up lipid measurements are not required for themajority of people (i.e., a ﬁre-and-forget policy is
recommended).
19This is because treatment initiation is
based on risk, and the bene ﬁts of statin-based therapy have
been shown to be independent of the level of cholesterol. Forthose with a total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dl) and
a personal or family history of premature ischemic heartdisease (e.g., an event before the age of 60 years in anindividual or ﬁrst-degree relative), it is important to consider
familial disease and specialist referral.
666
The bene ﬁts of lowering LDL cholesterol using statin-
based therapies on the risk of ASCVD are well established in
people with and without CKD. There are clearrecommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out
in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid
Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .19The Work
Group concurs with all the recommendations in this
guideline. In particular, we draw attention to:
Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged ‡50 years
with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2but not treated
with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR
categories G3a –G5), we recommend treatment with
a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A).
Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged ‡50 years
with CKD and eGFR ‡60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR
categories G1– G2), we recommend treatment with a
statin (1B).
Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18 –49 years
with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kid-
ney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment inpeople with one or more of the following (2A):
/C15known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or
coronary revascularization),
/C15diabetes mellitus,
/C15prior ischemic stroke, or
/C15estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death ornonfatal myocardial infarction >10%.
The Work Group offers the following practice points to
support implementation of the recommendations above.
Practice Point 3.15.1.1 Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk
using a validated risk tool.
Details of the Work Group recommendations on how to
estimate risk are provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.C u r r e n t l y ,
the CKD patch for the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation(SCORE) tool and the American Heart Association
PREVENT /C212
,pendingequations are the only ones validated.
Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-
based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largesttreatment bene ﬁts.
Since 2013, published literature has continued to demon-
strate the general safety of statin-based therapies.
667This
includes individual participant-level data meta-analysis by theCholesterol Treatment Trialists ’collaboration, showing that
statin therapy causes only a small excess of mild muscle pain,and most (> 90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms among
users are not due to their statins.
668In CKD, the Study of
Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) demonstrated that anintensive statin-based regimen was safe and not associatedwith any serious nonvascular hazard.
669,670A Cholesterol
Treatment Trialists ’collaboration meta-analysis combining
SHARP with the other large trials took into account thesmaller reductions in LDL cholesterol achieved with statin-based therapy in people with CKD G3 –G5. Afterchapter 3 www.kidney-international.org

standardization to a 1.0 mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) LDL cholesterol
difference, the RR reductions in major vascular eventsobserved with statin-based treatment in the large statin trialswere shown to become progressively smaller as eGFR
declines, with little evidence of bene ﬁt in people on dialysis
(Figure 37 ).
671The corollary of this observation is that in
people with CKD, statin-based regimens should be chosen to
maximize the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol toachieve the largest treatment bene ﬁts. Large trials have shown
the following once-daily intensive statin-based regimens aresafe in CKD (including people on dialysis): atorvastatin20 mg,
672rosuvastatin 10 mg,673and simvastatin 20 mg
combined with ezetimibe 10 mg.669,670
Practice Point 3.15.1.3: In adults with CKD aged 18 –49, a
lower (i.e., <10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary
death or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also beappropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-basedtherapy.
The Work Group deems it appropriate to consider lower
thresholds for the initiation of statin-based therapy in adultswith CKD than suggested in the KDIGO 2013

recommendations. There is good evidence for the safety of
intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering, and statin-based therapycombined with a ﬁre-and-forget strategy is low cost. This
approach is consistent with a more recent recommendation
for primary prevention in CKD by the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (which recom-mended 10-year thresholds of >7.5%).

Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proproteinconvertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors topeople with CKD who have an indication for their use.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) in-
hibitors have been shown to safely reduce ASCVD risk whenadded to maximal tolerated statin-based regimens in people athigh coronary risk.
675,676Subgroup analyses suggest that their
safety pro ﬁle and their biochemical and clinical ef ﬁcacy are
similar when participants with CKD and without CKD arecompared. These trials recruited down to an eGFR of 20 ml/min per 1.73 m

for the use of PCSK-9 inhibitors from the cardiology
community (and licensed indications) include as an adjunct to
diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment ofadults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or forpeople with clinical ASCVD who require additional lowering ofLDL cholesterol.
679,680
Dietary approaches.
Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based “Mediter-
ranean-style ”diet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to
reduce cardiovascular risk.
Diet and lipids have been comprehensively reviewed by
other clinical practice guidelines.679,681In that work, the
Work Groups highlighted that in general populations,observational studies have associated plant-based diets thatinclude higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts,legumes, ﬁsh, olive oil, yogurt, and whole grains, with lower
risk of CVD. Diets associated with higher risk are thoseincluding high consumption of red and processed meats,
reﬁned carbohydrates, and salt. Vegetable sources of fats
and polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., in nuts, seeds,
avocado, and olive oil) are also associated with a lower riskcompared with animal fats, including dairy fat.
679A
Mediterranean-style diet has an emphasis on extra virginolive oil and is high in unsaturated fat. RCTs have shownthat such diets have important effects on cardiovascular riskin the long term despite only small effects on traditional
markers of metabolic syndrome pro ﬁle.
682–685In the large
Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) primary
prevention trial of 7447 adults, the Mediterranean diet richin extra virgin olive oil reduced the risk of majorcardiovascular events by 31% (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53 –
0.91). The Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil andCardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) trial found thatallocation to a Mediterranean diet rich in extra virgin olive
oil reduced the risk of the composite of MACE byapproximately 22% –25%.
684There is no large-scale CKD-
speciﬁc trial comparing these dietary interventions.
3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy
Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low-
dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemiccardiovascular disease events (i.e., secondary pre-vention) in people with CKD and established
ischemic cardiovascular disease (1C).
This recommendation places high value on the importance of
reducing recurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic strokes,
or peripheral arterial diseas e complications in people with
CKD and established ischemic CVD due to the mortality and
disability associated with such complications. In secondaryprevention, trials have clearly shown the absolute bene ﬁts of
low-dose aspirin substantially exceed the potential for bleedingcomplications, creating certainty about net bene ﬁts when
treating this population. In people with CKD without priorischemic CVD, the balance of bene ﬁts and risks are uncertain
and may be counterbalanced —large RCTs are ongoing.
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harm. Based on a number of large
RCTs in populations that are likely to be largely free fromCKD, lifelong use of low-dose aspirin (75 –100 mg) for the
prevention of recurrence of complications of ischemic CVD isstrongly recommended among people with known CVD (a
therapeutic approach referred to as secondary prevention).
Conversely, it is not possible to provide de ﬁnitive recom-
mendations on when to use aspirin to prevent a ﬁrst ischemic
cardiovascular event (i.e., primary prevention) in people athigh risk, and a research recommendation is provided. This isdue to uncertainty of the net absolute value of such anapproach, as any reduction in the risk of atheroscleroticcardiovascular events needs to be weighed against the risk of
major bleeding. It is important to consider CKD-speci ﬁc data
in the totality of the evidence.
Key evidence from general populations is derived from a
2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-thrombotic Treatment Tria-
lists’collaboration. The analyses included data on long-term
aspirin use versus control care in 16 secondary preventiontrials (approximately 17,000 people at high average risk,approximately 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular
events [de ﬁned as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardio-
vascular death]), and 6 primary prevention trials (approxi-
mately 95,000 participants at low average risk, approximately660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events).
685aIn the
secondary prevention trials, allocation to aspirin reduced therisk of both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction byabout one-ﬁfth, such that an overall RR reduction for anyserious vascular event was 19% compared with controls
(RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75 –0.87). This equated to a 1.49%chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org
S236 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
lower absolute risk of serious vascular events per year
compared with an estimated absolute risk of any majorbleeding, which was an order of magnitude smaller at0.03% per year. Note that this hazard of major bleeding was
extrapolated from the primary prevention trials as stroke
causes and extracranial bleeds were generally not wellrecorded in the relatively older secondary prevention trials(Figure 38
685a).Some people with CKD have been included in antiplatelet
therapy trials. A recent Cochrane collaboration meta-analysisof 40,597 trial participants with CKD recruited into anti-platelet versus placebo trials and 11,805 recruited into anti-
platelet agent comparison trials found that allocation to
antiplatelet therapy may reduce the RR of myocardialinfarction by approximately 12% (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79 –
0.99). There was an expected increased risk of major bleeding,

but the magnitude of the RR was consistent with the data
from general populations (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10 –1.65).686
Note that these analyses did not distinguish betweenprimary and secondary prevention settings.
686The 2009
Anti-thrombotic Treatment Trialists ’collaboration meta-
analysis and results from 3 more recent large trials (A Studyof Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes [ASCEND],
687Aspirin
in Reducing Events in the Elderly [ASPREE],688and Aspirin
to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events [ARRIVE]689)
assessing the effects of aspirin versus placebo for primaryprevention in speci ﬁc high-risk populations found that any
harm from major bleeding counterbalanced any bene ﬁto f
aspirin on cardiovascular risk (with ASPREE and ARRIVEboth ﬁnding no signi ﬁcant effect on cardiovascular events
in their studied populations of older adults or high-riskadults, respectively).
685aA dedicated large primary
prevention aspirin trial in CKD is underway.690
Certainty of evidence. The 2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-
thrombotic Treatment Trialists ’collaboration on the effect of
aspirin compared with placebo in terms of the primary and
secondary prevention of CVD and safety among people with
and without CKD was assessed to have high risk of bias usingthe Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews(ROBIS) checklist due to unclear identi ﬁcation and selection
of studies, unclear data collection and study appraisal, andhigh risk of bias for synthesis and ﬁndings (although we did
not contact the authors to clarify these details).
685aThis
review did not report on the evidence or certainty of
evidence assessments directly in the report. Given the
available evidence, the recommendation has a low certaintyof evidence (Level C).
Values and preferences. Maintaining QoL by minimizing
risk of worsening of ischemic heart disease and recurrentstroke-related disability is important to both people withCKD and caregivers.
691The Work Group considered that the
risk of bleeding would be considered acceptable by most
people with CKD once the clear net bene ﬁts were explained
and gastroprotection was offered. The Work Group
considered that some people with CKD without priorischemic coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterialdisease but at increased risk (e.g., due to diabetes) may stillwish to consider using aspirin and accept the risk of majorbleeding.
687Some people with CKD may also have a kidney
diagnosis that indirectly supports considering the use of
aspirin despite a lack of evidence (e.g., presumed or proven
renovascular disease). The Work Group is not aware of anyrisk tools that could be used to help counsel such peoplewith CKD as to their expected net absolute bene ﬁts and
risks based on risk factors of the person with CKD,including any difference by sex. (Note that scores to predictcardiovascular risk are considered in Chapter 2 .)
Resource use and costs. Low-dose aspirin is available at low
cost and does not require monitoring.
Considerations for implementation. Proton-pump inhibitors
(PPIs) are generally effective,692safe, and low cost (althoughoccasionally associated with an interstitial nephritis), andthe Work Group considers that it is prudent to considerbleeding risk and offers PPIs when prescribing antiplatelettherapy or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such
therapies are combined.
693
Rationale
Meta-analysis of trials has clearly established the cardio-
vascular bene ﬁts of low-dose aspirin in people who have
established ASCVD. Any harm of bleeding is far outweighed
by the bene ﬁts (unlike the situation for primary prevention,
where bleeding risk has been consistently identi ﬁed in
large aspirin trials and cardiovascular bene ﬁts to date have
not).
Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy
(e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance.
Bleeding from gastrointestinal mucosa with antiplatelet
therapy is likely to be due to their effect on hemostasis of pre-existing mucosal lesions. This hypothesis is supported byP2Y
12inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel or ticagrelor) not reducing
the risk of bleeding in trials comparing them to aspirin.694,695
However, if people are aspirin intolerant, a P2Y 12inhibitor is
a noninferior alternative. Note that in 2009, the FDArecommended that the coadministration of clopidogrel andomeprazole (a PPI) should be avoided because omeprazole
reduces the effectiveness of clopidogrel. There is uncertainty
about the precise effect of omeprazole as pharmacokineticdata are inconclusive, but PPIs with inhibition of CYP2C19are preferred when using clopidogrel.
696
Guidelines from the cardiology community provide rec-
ommendations for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for aperiod after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneouscoronary intervention. These guidelines recommend to
apply the same diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in
people with CKD.
663CKD does not modify the bene ﬁts of
ticagrelor,697and antiplatelet therapy doses do not need to
be modiﬁ ed at decreased eGFR. Note that other
antithrombotic therapy choices and doses may need toconsider a person ’sG F R .
Special considerations
International considerations. Given the clinical effectiveness
of low-dose aspirin and its low cost, there should not be manybarriers to accessing this medication in any setting.
3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary
artery disease
Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable
stress-test con ﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an
initial conservative approach using intensive medi-
cal therapy is an appropriate alternative to an initial
invasive strategy (2D).chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org
S238 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
This recommendation places high value on the ﬁnding from
recent, large trials in both general and CKD populations that
have suggested that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initialstrategy for the management of stable stress-test con ﬁrmed
ischemic heart disease. It places value on the need for in-terventions, which carry risk to people with CKD and sub-stantial healthcare costs to demonstrate bene ﬁts on
cardiovascular outcomes before they are considered a standard ofcare. Importantly, this recommendation should not apply tothose with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction(e.g., ejection fraction <35%), or left main stem disease as they
were excluded from the de ﬁnitive trials. It should be noted that
trials in CKD have not ruled out antianginal bene ﬁts in people
with CKD (despite negative ﬁndings).
Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harm. Bene ﬁts.Beneﬁts should be
considered in the context of the totality of evidence in people
with and without CKD regarding interventions. Comparisons
between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive in-terventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce deathor prevent myocardial infarction.
707,707aHowever, those with
frequent angina symptoms (at least weekly) gainedimprovement with the invasive strategy
707; thus, the bene ﬁt
of an invasive strategy might be restricted to those withangina. The reason for a lack of clear antianginal effect of an
invasive strategy in International Study of Comparative
Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches —
Chronic Kidney Disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD) needs someconsideration, and key reasons relating to insuf ﬁcient power
due to protocol differences have been proposed.
698Although
low power to detect an effect on angina is a key potentialexplanation for differences in ﬁndings between the 2 trials,
CKD-MBD and coronary calci ﬁcation in CKD, which makes
microvascular disease more common and increases thetechnical challenge of revascularization, may also have partlycontributed to these differences.
699
The ERT assessed the effects of angiography or coronary
intervention in people with CKD and ischemic heart diseaseidenti ﬁed 4 other trials, but excluded mixed populations,
including ISCHEMIA-CKD, which recruited some people ondialysis and some people who have received a kidney trans-
plant. The review found no clear bene ﬁts on cardiovascular
outcomes in 3 other trials and raised a hypothesis about
beneﬁcial effects on mortality overall (Supplementary Table
S13
700–704). Such an effect has not been observed in the
larger general population trials.
Harms. The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of
dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was inter-estingly not periprocedural).
707
Certainty of evidence. The ERT review was limited to trials
only recruiting people with CKD (and did not include theISCHEMIA-CKD trial discussed above due to the inclusion ofsome people on dialysis and some people who have received akidney transplant). The overall certainty of the evidencecomparing coronary revascularization with optimal medicaltherapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT andischemic heart disease is very low (Supplementary TableS13
700–704). Most of the RCTs reporting on the critical
outcomes (all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events,
kidney failure, and AKI) had some concerns regarding the
risk of bias, particularly with lack of blinding for theoutcome assessors, participants crossing over to the othertreatment group, and the selection of reporting. Thecertainty of the evidence was downgraded for all outcomesbecause of imprecision. The certainty of the evidence forcardiovascular mortality was downgraded becausepublication bias was strongly suspected.
Values and preferences. Although this was not con ﬁrmed
by ISCHEMIA-CKD, antianginal bene ﬁts of an invasive
strategy are apparent in general populations, and people withsymptoms may still elect for an initially invasive approach tomanage stable stress-test con ﬁrmed coronary artery disease
after being counseled about the risks.
Resource use and costs. It is not possible to formally assess
the cost-effectiveness of intensive medical therapy versus an
initial invasive strategy due to mixed ﬁndings from the evi-
dence in people with stable ischemic heart disease. However,
invasive strategies will have higher cost implications tohealthcare systems, people with CKD, or both.
Considerations for implementation. Access and availability
of invasive therapies will vary in different healthcare sys-tems, as might the availability of medications for maximalmedical therapy. The key to implementation is to encourage
the understanding of the value of full therapy as compared
with invasive therapy so that healthcare providers andpeople with CKD understand the risks and bene ﬁts of
invasive strategies. Given the costs of invasive strategies,there may be additional value to implementing thisrecommendation.
Rationale
Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasivestrategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based onsymptoms, and intensive medical therapy is a suitable
approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or
without CKD. In CKD, the antianginal bene ﬁts of an initially
invasive approach have not been demonstrated.
Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an inva-
sive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKDwith acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levelsof angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left ventricular
systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main
disease.
The ISCHEMIA trial has been described as deeply dis-
rupting prior attitudes regarding management strategies forpeople with stable coronary artery disease,
705and clinical
practice guidelines that predate the trial need updating.706
Despite the International Study of Comparative HealthEffectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches
(ISCHEMIA) and ISCHEMIA-CKD trial results, it iswww.kidney-international.org chapter 3
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S239
considered that the well-established intervention of coronary
revascularization will continue to have a key role in anginarelief.
705Importantly, this recommendation should not
apply to those with unacceptably severe angina symptoms.
It should also be noted that people with left ventricular
dysfunction (i.e., ejection fraction <35%) or left main
disease were excluded from the de ﬁnitive ISCHEMIA
trial.707aThe Work Group considers that certain design
features of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial may have led toangina bene ﬁts not being detected, and the trial results
should not rule out angina bene ﬁts in people with CKD
(see above). If an invasive strategy is pursued, there are
effective strategies to reduce the risk of contrast-induced
AKI (Chapter 4).
708
The totality of the evidence from the CKD-speci ﬁc trials is
consistent with no net difference between an initial conser-vative approach using aggressive medical therapy versus aninvasive strategy when treating stable stress-test con ﬁrmed
ischemic heart disease. This is consistent with the large gen-eral population-based ISCHEMIA trial.
707a
3.16 CKD and atrial ﬁbrillation
In CKD, the same principles to diagnose and manage atrial
ﬁbrillation should be used as in people without CKD.
Prevalence and consequences. Atrial ﬁbrillation is the com-
monest sustained arrhythmia, with risk increasing steeply with
increasing age (earlier in men than women).709There is a
particularly high prevalence in people with CKD. Crudeprevalence ranging from 16% to 21% has been reported inpeople with CKD not requiring KRT.
710In the cohorts
contributing to the CKD-PC, adults with CKD G3, A1 had
an adjusted risk of atrial ﬁbrillation of 1.2 –1.5, increasing to
an adjusted risk of 4.2 by CKD stages G5, A3 ( Figure 3912).
Atrial ﬁbrillation can directly cause thromboembolism
(particularly stroke) and/or heart failure. It is also linked,
perhaps directly or through shared risk factors, with increasedrisk of death, hospitalization, vascular dementia, depression,and reduced QoL.
709Detailed clinical practice guidelines have
been formulated by the cardiology community describing
deﬁnitions, classi ﬁcation, diagnosis, screening strategies, and
management.709It is beyond the scope of this KDIGO
guideline to consider all aspects of the diagnosis and
management of atrial ﬁbrillation in people with CKD. The
ERT review focused on the role of non –vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus warfarin forthromboprophylaxis in CKD.
Identi ﬁcation and management. Atrial ﬁbrillation can be
asymptomatic but symptoms are not a prerequisite for risk ofcomplications. As the prevalence of atrial ﬁbrillation is high in
people with CKD and there are effective strategies to manageits associated complications, opportunistic pulse-basedscreening (e.g., when taking BP), followed by a 12-leadelectrocardiogram if an irregularly irregular pulse is identi ﬁed
should be considered. Such an approach is low cost andsimple to implement. Figure 40 outlines approaches to
different diagnostic and management strategies.
Practice Point 3.16.1: Follow established strategies for the
diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation ( Figure 40 ).
Prophylaxis against stroke and systemic thromboembolism.
Recent cardiology guidelines recommend a risk factor –based
approach to stroke thromboprophylaxis decisions in atrialﬁbrillation using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension,Age$75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular
disease, Age 65 to 74, and Sex category (female) (CHA
2DS2-
VASc) stroke risk score. They recommend that only people at“low stroke risk ”(CHA
2DS2-VASc score ¼0i nm e n ,o r1i n
women) should not be offered antithrombotic therapy. Oralanticoagulants should be considered for stroke preventionwith a CHA
2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women,
considering net clinical bene ﬁt and values and preferences
of people with CKD. Oral anticoagulants are clearly recom-mended for stroke prevention in people with atrial ﬁbrillation
and a CHA
2DS2-VASc score $2 in men or $3 in women.709
Our Work Group considered that oral anticoagulation for
thromboprophylaxis should nearly always be considered for
preventing stroke in people with decreased eGFR and atrialﬁbrillation (Figure 40 ). The presence of decreased GFR is a
risk for thromboembolic stroke in people with atrialﬁbrillation.
710–712It has been estimated that approximately
95% of people with an eGFR of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
have a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of $2, increasing to
approximately 99% at an eGFR of <30 ml/min per 1.73
m2.711Importantly, it has also been shown that in a group
of people with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 0 to 1 point (i.e.,
a group where thromboprophylaxis may not be consideredindicated), people with CKD within the group are at muchhigher risk of cerebrovascular and other systemic105+

thromboembolic events, with an annual rate of 2.9%
compared with 0.2% in people without CKD.711
Including GFR into atrial ﬁbrillation risk scores has not
shown important incremental bene ﬁt to its introduction (e.g.,
adding 2 points for CrCl <60 ml/min to CHADS 2—referred
to as Renal Dysfunction, Congestive Heart Failure, Hyper-tension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack[R
2CHADS 2])—improved net reclassi ﬁcation index but not
the C-statistic.710However, as decreased GFR is associated
with age, diabetes, CVD, and so on, the incrementalpredictive advantage by adding a CKD parameter to theCHA
2DS2-VASc score, which already includes these
parameters, would be expected to have little effect. There isconsiderable scope to improve the predictive performanceof thromboprophylaxis risk scores for use in CKD.

Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of
non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
(NOACs) in preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion in people with CKD G1– G4(1C).
This recommendation puts high value on the use of NOACs, also
referred to as direct-acting oral anticoagulants or DOACs, in
people with CKD due to their simpler pharmacokinetic pro ﬁle,
dosing, and monitoring than vitamin K antagonists and due to
their improved ef ﬁcacy and relatively similar safety pro ﬁle.
Although people with CKD G4 –G5 have been understudied in
RCTs, implementation in such groups can be achieved afterconsidering choice of NOAC and dosing.Key information
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. Beneﬁ ts.Data from 42,411
participants who received NOACs and 29,272 participantswho received warfarin in 4 phase III trials were meta-analyzedin 2014. Such trials largely excluded people with CKD G4 –G5
but did include large numbers of participants with earlierstages of CKD. Overall, NOACs signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk
of stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared withwarfarin (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73 –0.91). This bene ﬁt was a
result largely from reduced risk of hemorrhagic strokes (RR:0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 –0.64). There were large amounts of data
on stroke in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min, and the
relative bene ﬁts were consistent and clearly evident in people
with CKD. There were also consistent effects in subgroupanalyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, and CHADS
2
score.714A more recent meta-analysis published in 2021 only
focused on subgroups with CKD and included data from 7
trials of NOACs versus warfarin in atrial ﬁbrillation. It also
reported a 19% reduced risk of stroke/thromboembolic
complications in the NOAC group (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.69–0.97).
715Data in CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to
observational studies.715Our evidence review aimed to
collect information on subtypes of outcome from subgroupanalyses reporting results speci ﬁcally in people with CKD.
Evidence of ef ﬁcacy in the large trials is mainly for the
outcomes of stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but our reviewonly found data from 3 trials for these outcomes resultingin imprecise estimates of effect. The ﬁndings were
qualitatively consistent with the totality of the evidence(Figure 41 ,Supplementary Table S14
716–721). Step 1
Diagnosis• In people with CKD, use opportunistic pulse-based screening (e.g., taking at when measuring BP), followed by a
  wearable device or Holter ECG testing
Step 2
Prophylaxis against
stroke and systemic
thromboembolism  (they are likely to have an increased CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor for stroke and are at high risk even with a score of 0–1)
  managed (e.g., alcohol advice, use of a proton pump inhibitor) 
Step 3
Rate/rhythm control†
• Use medical therapy (e.g., beta blockade) to control ventricular rate to less than about 90 bpm at rest to decrease
  symptoms and related complications
• For people with persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control, consider rhythm control with cardioversion,
  antiarrhythmic therapy and/or catheter ablation 
Figure 40 | Strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation. * Consider dose adjustments necessary in people with
chronic kidney disease (CKD).†The following has been recommended as a standard package for diagnostic evaluation of new atrial ﬁbrillation:
(i) a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to establish the diagnosis, assess ventricular rate, and check for the presence of conduction defects,
ischemia, or structural heart disease; (ii) laboratory testing for thyroid and kidney function, serum electrolytes, and full blood count; and (iii)transthoracic echocardiography to assess left ventricular size and function, left atrial size, for valvular disease, and right heart size and function.BP, blood pressure; CHA

Harms. The 2014 meta-analysis of 4 large phase III trials
found that NOACs reduced the risk of death from any
cause by 10%, con ﬁrming net safety (RR: 0.90; 95% CI:
0.85–0.95). Compared with warfarin, NOACs reduced the
risk of intracranial hemorrhage (de ﬁned as hemorrhagic
stroke, epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage)by about one-half (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.39 –0.59), and the
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was increased by aboutone-quarter (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01 –1.55). Overall, there
was no clear effect on the combination of these 2 safetyoutcomes referred to as major bleeding (RR: 0.86; 95% CI:0.73–1.00).
714There were large amounts of data on major
bleeding in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min, so
reassuring safety data clearly extended to people withCKD. There were also consistent safety data in subgroupanalyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, andCHADS
2score. There was a suggestion that major bleeding
was signi ﬁcantly reduced in people attending centers where
time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) rangewas<66% compared with centers with $66% time in range
(interaction P¼0.02). This suggests that bene ﬁts of NOACs
are in part a result of their simpler pharmacokinetic pro ﬁleand dosing.
714The 2021 meta-analysis that focused on CKD
subgroups from 7 trials found that bleeding events were alsonot signi ﬁcantly different among those allocated NOACs
versus warfarin (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.58 –1.18).
715Data in
CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to observational studies.715
Our evidence review was again limited to a small number of
studies reporting subtypes of bleeding outcomes, and so
analyses found imprecise estimates of treatment effect. Theﬁndings were qualitatively consistent with the totality of the
evidence ( Figure 42 ,Supplementary Table S15
716–722). The
review raised a hypothesis that some NOACs may be morelikely to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, given theevidence of effect modi ﬁcation by time in therapeutic range in
the warfarin group, we have not provided speci ﬁc
recommendations to prefer certain NOACs.
Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence
comparing NOACs with warfarin among people with CKDand atrial ﬁbrillation is low (Supplementary Tables S14
716–721
and S15716–722). Most of the RCTs evaluating the critical
outcomes were considered to have a low risk of bias. Thecritical outcome of stroke was reported as any stroke,ischemic stroke, and/or hemorrhagic stroke. Because thereKidney

were few stroke events reported across the RCTs, the certainty
of the evidence was downgraded for imprecision.
Values and preferences. High value on the use of NOACs
included the conclusion that the simple dosing and lack ofINR monitoring compared with vitamin K antagonists wouldlead to a substantial reduction in burden for those with an
indication for anticoagulation and their health services. There
is also good evidence for improved ef ﬁcacy and a relatively
similar safety pro ﬁle. Most fully informed people with CKD
would be expected to select a NOAC over a vitamin Kantagonist.
Resource use and costs. NOACs have been shown to be
cost-effective for stroke prevention in atrial ﬁbrillation and
may even be cost-saving in people with CKD. Vitamin K
antagonist use may be associated with higher costs andachieve fewer quality-adjusted life-years compared with
NOACs.723
Considerations for implementation. A decision not to anti-
coagulate for thromboembolic prophylaxis due to low riskwould ideally be re-evaluated at each consultation and at leastevery 6 months. When using antithrombotic therapy in
people with CKD, it is prudent to treat modi ﬁable risk factors
for bleeding (e.g., alcohol intake) and use gastroprophylaxis
with a PPI, particularly when combined with antiplatelettherapy.
Rationale
A number of large RCTs demonstrated that NOACs reducethe risk of intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin and,overall, modestly reduce mortality in people with atrialKidney

Practice Point 3.16.2: NOAC dose adjustment for GFR is
required, with caution needed at CKD G4 –G5.

Chapter 4: Medication management and drug
stewardship in CKD
Medication management is an important component of the
care of people with CKD. Medications can be highly bene ﬁ-
cial, but some may be toxic, are excreted by the kidney, mayhave narrow therapeutic windows, or may have no provenclear evidence of bene ﬁt or indication in people with CKD.
Drug stewardship refers to the effective, safe, and sus-
tainable use of medications by all staff and physicians,encompassing the whole cycle of medication use. Medica-
tions need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for ef ﬁ-
cacy and safety, and when they do not or no longer serve
their intended purpose, discontinued. This chapter discusseskey concepts in the processes of drug stewardship in peoplewith CKD. It is beyond the scope of this guideline to list allthe medications that may have altered risks/bene ﬁts in
people with CKD. Such information is widely available indocuments that may exist at local, regional, or national
bodies (e.g., British National Formulary: www.bnf.org )a n d
in textbooks of pharmacology. However, we describe case
examples to highlight the key classes of commonly pre-scribed medications in people with CKD. This guidance isbased on knowledge of pharmacology that has universalrelevance. In many cases, knowledge of altered risks/bene ﬁts
of medications comes, however, from observational studiesand case reports from routine care.
4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety
Abnormal kidney function results in alteration in pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and for people with CKD,
as the GFR worsens, so does the prevalence of polypharmacyand comorbidities.
725People with CKD are at increased risk
of medication errors and inappropriate prescribing (notedto be up to 37% in ambulatory outpatient studies and upto 43% in long-term care studies
726,727). Thus, improved
understanding and collaboration with pharmacists indeveloping care plans and medication review is strongly
recommended.
People with CKD have reduced ability to excrete medica-
tions and/or their metabolites (which may increase adverse
event risk or exaggerate/diminish ef ﬁcacy) and increased
sensitivity to medications (e.g., those bound to albumin inhypoalbuminemic states such as nephrotic syndrome).Additional issues include nephrotoxicity, diminished toler-ance of side effects in the context of coexisting comorbidities
or older age, and lack of adequate evidence for either bene ﬁt
or harm of speci ﬁc compounds, due to historical exclusion of
people with (advanced) CKD from most clinical trials.
727,728As in all medical decision-making, healthcare providers
should consider the indication, bene ﬁt-risk pro ﬁle, and po-
tential nephrotoxicity while balancing accessibility, availabil-
ity, local health policies, cultural practices, affordability, andpatient preferences. Where available, consultation withpharmacists as part of the multidisciplinary team is encour-aged to assure optimized comprehensive medication man-agement and to improve pharmacoequity.
Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more sus-
ceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. Whenprescribing such medications to people with CKD, alwaysconsider the bene ﬁts versus potential harms.
Between 18% –20% of people with CKD G3 –G5 receive at
least one potentially inappropriate nephrotoxic medicationannually, primarily NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antivirals, and
bisphosphonates.
729Nephrotoxic medications may be
indicated in people with CKD if expected bene ﬁts exceed
potential harms.730However, whenever possible, healthcare
providers should strive to use non-nephrotoxic alternatives.
Common nephrotoxic medications to be aware of andpotential alternatives that could be prescribed instead arelisted in Table 31 .
725,731–738Although some nephrotoxic
medications have viable alternatives, the alternatives may be
less potent or there is limited comparison data on clinical
outcomes, safety, and cost-effectiveness.
Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and ther-
apeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people withCKD receiving medications with narrow therapeutic win-dows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity, both inoutpatient practice and in hospital settings.
Ensuring a safe use of medication requires careful moni-
toring for adverse effects and ef ﬁcacy. A key example includes
the need to monitor potassium and creatinine during theinitial weeks of treatment with ACEi and ARBs (Figure 21 ).
23
Medications such as gentamicin and vancomycin have anarrow therapeutic range, with higher trough levelscommonly associated with AKI, and so require closemonitoring of GFR and medication levels during prolonged
treatment.
731Other medications, such as lithium or
methotrexate, require at least annual monitoring of
creatinine to evaluate potential risks of nephrotoxicity.
Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the-
counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that maybe harmful for people with CKD.chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org
S246 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314
Kidney disease can be induced or accelerated by the use of
certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal rem-
edies, and other dietary supplements. One of the most usedclass of OTC analgesic medications is NSAIDs. NSAIDs areassociated with interstitial nephritis, analgesic nephropathy,and hypertension.
739Indiscriminate chronic OTC NSAID use
has been associated with a higher risks of kidney failure
compared with nonuse and should be discouraged.740–743
However, judicious NSAID use, under careful supervision of
a nephrologist, may be preferred to other pain medicationssuch as opioids that have stronger associations with adverseevents.
744,745PPIs are also common OTC medications in
some countries that have been associated with AKI andCKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute interstitialnephritis.
733,734
The use of herbal compounds remains highly prevalent in
some countries and cultures.746These products are often used
in an unmonitored setting without the input of healthcareproviders. Many of these remedies are composed of naturalcompounds with complex active ingredients that have notbeen evaluated in people with CKD and/or that may lead tomany different adverse effects. The frequency of CKDassociated with herbal remedy use is not known and is
likely different in different parts of the world, depending on
local availability and reasons for use. Examples includearistolochic acid nephropathy or nephrotoxicity due toalkaloid compounds often found in Chinese herbalremedies.
747However, cases of nephrotoxicity have been
reported for many other herbal remedies globally.746,748,749
The potential toxicity of herbal remedies may be enhancedby coexisting volume depletion and by other illness ormedication use.
Dietary supplements are readily available in most countries
around the world and are usually not classi ﬁed as OTC med-
ications. Because of this, their regulation for identity and safetycan vary widely. Although laws pertaining to dietary supple-ment labeling prohibit speci ﬁc claims for the treatment or
prevention of disease, these products are widely used as“alternative ”or“complementary ”therapy. Patients and pro-
viders often assume that these products are at least safe andpossibly effective. Their pharmacokinetics may be unknownand potential toxicity unstudied. Classic examples includecreatine supplements used for body building that have beenassociated with allergic interstitial nephritis.
750,751Another
example is vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements, which in
excess can lead to tubular calcium oxalate crystal deposition.752
Healthcare providers are encouraged to routinely inquire
about the use of herbal remedies and recommend stopping
any unprescribed alternative remedy that may pose a threatfor (kidney) health. Figure 45

remedies and dietary supplements arranged by the countrieswhere the adverse effects were reported to increaseawareness and facilitate discussions.
Special considerations
Global access to medications. Access to medications varies
globally. Approximately 30% of the world population lackstimely access to quality medications. The International Soci-
ety of Nephrology (ISN) reports that only 35% of patients in
low-resource settings have access to ACEi/ARBs, statins, andTable 31 | Key examples of common medications with documented nephrotoxicity and, where available, selected non-
nephrotoxic alternatives

insulin.755There are also numerous barriers to additional
important medications for the management of CKD
complications, such as erythropoietin analogs, iron infusion,and phosphate or potassium binders.
There are growing concerns regarding the use of falsi ﬁed
and substandard medications in low- to lower-middle –in-
come countries as they pose potential harm, particularly tothose people at risk of and with CKD. Patients and theirfamilies should be aware that medication falsiﬁ cation is often
associated with illicit internet supply. Many vulnerable com-munities and people with low health literacy and those incountries with less rigorous regulatory systems are more atrisk of medication falsi ﬁcation. Therefore, increased global
awareness is important, and people with CKD should beprovided with appropriate education and follow-up withrelevant support in accordance with local health policies.
Medications and pregnancy.
Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications topeople with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, alwaysreview teratogenicity potential and provide regular repro-ductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance with
the values and preferences of the person with CKD.
When pregnancy is not desired, we note that while the
effect of different forms of contraception on GFR is un-
known,
756oral contraceptives are associated with increasedBP and hypertension.757Nonoral hormonal contraceptives
have a less clear impact on BP.757
Pregnancy may pose a risk of CKD progression for people
with established CKD. In addition, some recommended medi-cations to slow or prevent CKD progression are teratogenic (such
as ACEi/ARBs or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors)
and discontinuation during pregnancy should be considered.
758
Some CKD-speci ﬁc medications should be continued during
pregnancies such as hydroxychloroquine, tacrolimus,cyclosporin, eculizumab, prednisone, azathioprine, colchicine,and intravenous immunoglobulin. A thorough medicationchart review is necessary to replace teratogenic medicationsbefore conception, or whenever this is not possible, ensure a
strict monitoring plan with cessation of potentially teratogenic
medications at conception.
759A similar approach should be
undertaken during lactation recognizing that somemedications suitable for use during pregnancy may not beappropriate for lactation, and vice versa.
760Multidisciplinary
care with obstetrics and potentially other subspecialty care isrequired before conception and throughout pregnancy andlactation.

may impact drug metabolism and response. Because drug
dosages are often universal, women are more likely toconsume higher doses in relation to their bodyweight,
136,763,764and this could be associated with more
adverse events.136In people with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction, observational studies show improvedsurvival in women with lower doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocking medications, whereasmen bene ﬁt from higher doses.
765,766This may be related to
lower RAAS activity in women compared with men.767
4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR
Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medicationscleared by the kidneys.
Many medications and/or their active metabolites are
excreted by the kidneys. Failure to properly account for theeffect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regi-mens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverseevents.
725,728Although guidelines for adjustment of the
dosing regimen at varying severities of CKD provided bythe manufacturer are widely available in pharmacopeias,textbooks, online references, or local procedures, there maybe signi ﬁcant differences in information provided by these
resources.
768
Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings,validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate fordrug dosing.
Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for
drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow
therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situ-
ations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use ofequations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, ormeasured GFR may be indicated.
An assessment of GFR is important for guiding decisions
related to the choice and dosing of medications. Section 1.2
addresses the accuracy of validated eGFR equations, as wellas indications for the use of eGFRcr-cys or mGFR.
There is inconsistency between this guidance and those
found in the package inserts or classic source references fordrug dosing. Regulatory agencies have not universallyrequired pharmacokinetics in abnormal kidney function formedication approval.
769In addition, although the Cockcroft-
Gault formula for estimating CrCl has been used in many pastpharmacokinetic studies that serve as the basis for the drugdosing, there are multiple concerns with that equation. It
was developed in an era when the need for standardization
of creatinine measurements was not appreciated, womenand individuals of Black race were not included, and thereare concerns about use of weight, which can be impactedby edema or obesity.
770However, to date, few studies have
been conducted to compare different equations for eGFR inthe context of drug dosing/kinetics, etc.There is now a recognition by major regulatory agencies
that “any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically
applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonableto assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies. ”
770,771
Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of bodyweight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) maybe indicated, especially for medications with a narrowtherapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentrationto be effective.
For assessment of CKD, it is relevant to compare the GFR
according to a standard body size. For this reason, GFR
estimating equations have been developed in units of ml/min
per 1.73 m
2. However, because drug clearance is more
strongly associated with nonindexed eGFR (ml/min) thanindexed eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m
2), in very small or large
individuals, this can result in over- or underdosing, respec-tively, as well as noninitiation of certain medications.
772,773
Nonindexed eGFR can be obtained by multiplying theindexed eGFR results by the person ’s BSA and dividing by
1.73 m
2, or by using an appropriate online calculator.
Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing inpeople where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration
markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state.
In people with rapidly changing health status, it can be a
challenge to estimate the GFR. Serum concentrations ofﬁltration markers may be changing because of changes in true
GFR and/or in non-GFR determinants of the marker (Section
1.2). In such settings for people who require medications that
are impacted by or could impact GFR, healthcare providersshould regularly assess risk, bene ﬁts, and value of the
medication, and consider higher or lower doses thanindicated. Where possible, use medication level testing toguide dosing.
730,774
Special considerations
Dose adjustments in cancer. GFR plays a large role in
determining anticancer therapy, including anticancer agentselection, dosing, and eligibility for investigational drugs and
clinical trials.
775,776Notwithstanding its lack of validation and
its relative inaccuracy compared with other validated eGFR
equations, the Cockroft-Gault equation continues to be oneof the most commonly used eGFR methods for thesepeople.
775,776An evaluation of eGFR equation performance
against mGFR determined by plasma clearance of51Cr-
EDTA in 1200 people with solid tumors observed theeGFRcr (CKD-EPI) and the eGFRcr-cys (CKD-EPI)
predicted mGFR with greater accuracy than Cockroft-
Gault.
136We advise that the same approach to GFR
evaluation described in Section 1.2be adopted in oncology
practice and clinical trials.136,764BSA-adjusted eGFR may be
indicated for selected speci ﬁc situations like carboplatin
dosing. It is important to consider that non-GFRdeterminants of both creatinine and cystatin C may bewww.kidney-international.org chapter 4
Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S249
more profound in people with cancer, and mGFR may be the
preferred method to guide the initial dosing for a select groupof anticancer drugs including, but not limited to, carboplatin,cisplatin, and methotrexate (Section 1.2).
Dose adjustment in children/neonates. In addition to the
usual weight-based dosing for children, speci ﬁc guidance on
drug dosing should be followed for neonates who have lowerGFR than those outside the neonatal period.
Dose adjustment in pregnancy. Creatinine decreases physi-
ologically during pregnancy due to glomerular hyper-ﬁltration, and BSA varies. This creates challenges for usingGFR or eGFR equations.
54In such settings for people who
require medications that are impacted by or could impactGFR, healthcare providers should regularly assess risk,beneﬁt, and value of medications.
4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship
People with CKD are particularly susceptible to poly-pharmacy due to multiplicity of comorbidities and multiplephysician or health system encounters related to those. Mostpeople with CKD not treated with dialysis receive 6 –12
different medications per day.
763Polypharmacy leads to
increased pill burden and potential harm due to medication
errors and drug-drug interactions. Thus, healthcare
providers, including clinical pharmacists, should be diligentin assessing medication appropriateness, number, dose, andpotential interactions. Drug stewardship promotes safemedication use throughout the course of therapy.Medications need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored
for ef ﬁcacy and safety, and when no longer required,
discontinued.
Practice Point 4.3.1: Perform thorough medication review
periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence,continued indication, and potential drug interactionsbecause people with CKD often have complex medicationregimens and are seen by multiple specialists.
Medication review is essential for minimizing the occur-
rence of medication-related problems (e.g., inappropriatelyhigh doses and drug interactions) that commonly occur in theCKD population.
777If a person no longer has an indication
for a medication that may contribute to kidney injury (e.g.,PPIs), healthcare providers should recognize theopportunity to discontinue the medication. Medicationreview at each clinical encounter, especially care transitions,
is an opportunity to review medication types, interval, and
doses especially if the individual has experienced a declinein GFR (e.g., metformin) or physiologic changes that canimpact medication volume of distribution (e.g., volumeoverload and sarcopenia).

Figure 46 | Suggested steps in the process of medication review and reconciliation. Best practices for medication review and reconciliation
in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) include 8 steps728and can be summarized as follows: (i) obtain an accurate medication list from the
patient; (ii) evaluate whether all medications are medically necessary or whether any other medications is required; (iii) assess whether current
therapy represents the “drug of choice ”for each indication, individualized for each patient; (iv) evaluate the medication dosage and regimen,
taking into consideration related factors such as liver dysfunction, patient size, or weight (e.g., amputation, muscle wasting, and over- orunderweight); (v) review the medication list for drug interactions, including drug-drug, drug-disease, drug-laboratory, and drug-foodinteractions; (vi) ensure that proper monitoring takes place; (vii) determine whether there are any barriers to patient adherence, and evaluaterelevant laboratory values; and (viii) identify and resolve any discrepancies between the medications list and the one in the medical record;communication of performed changes in the medication chart with other physicians is necessary given the role of multiple prescribers involvedin the care of patients with CKD.

evaluated medication review by clinical practices in people
with CKD, observing reductions in the use of inappropriatemedications and medication-related problems, both inoutpatient and inpatient settings.
765,766The most frequent
reviews involved altering dosage or dose interval anddiscontinuing NSAIDs. More frequent medication reviewsmay be needed in older adults with complex medicationregimens compared with younger people with CKD.
In the context of good drug stewardship, healthcare pro-
viders should be aware of the issue of “prescribing cascade. ”A
prescribing cascade is a sequence of events that begins whenan adverse event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition
and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this adverse
event.
779Before prescribing new medications to address
newly reported symptoms, it is important to ﬁrst assess if
the symptoms represent a side effect from an existingmedication. An example of a prescribing cascade is asfollows: peripheral edema because of calcium channelblocker may be managed by initiation of a new medication(i.e., diuretic), which can lead to additional adverse
reactions (e.g., hypokalemia and dizziness).
Practice Point 4.3.2: If medications are discontinued during
an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when torestart the discontinued medications to the affected personand healthcare providers, and ensure documentation in themedical record.
Sick day rules have been endorsed as useful guidance to people
with CKD in the setting of acute, dehydrating illness. Speci ﬁcally,
patients receive guidance to temporarily stop the followingmedications: sulfonylureas, ACEi, diuretics/direct renin in-h i b i t o r s ,m e t f o r m i n ,A R B s ,N S A I D s ,a n dS G L T 2 i( o f t e nd e s c r i b e dwith the acronym SADMANS).
780However, there is a paucity of
evidence to support sick day rules to prevent AKI or otherclinically relevant outcomes.
781,782Instead, data suggest
potential harm if people make mistakes in recognizing
dehydrating illness or about which drugs to stop and when to
restart.783Figure 47 shows the steps that must occur correctly
for sick day rules to be implemented appropriately. The mostreported problem is failure to restart the medication.
784The
plan to restart medications should be detailed in the medicalrecords and clearly communicated to the patients. Patients mayadditionally bene ﬁtf r o mm e d i c a t i o nr e v i e ww i t h i nam o n t ht o
ensure appropriate medications are restarted.Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation ofmedications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i)in the 48 –72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the
acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary
measure to prevent complications. However, note that
failure to restart these medications after the event or pro-cedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point4.3.2).
The rationale for temporary discontinuation of certain
medications before elective surgery or procedures is to pre-vent perioperative AKI and other complications such as hy-potension or metabolic acidosis or hyperkalemia during the
perioperative period.
735Medications that should be
discontinued before elective surgery due to potential
perioperative adverse effects are shown in Table 32 .735,736
There is consistent evidence that withholding RASi is
associated with lower risk of perioperative hypotension invarious types of surgery and procedures (noncardiac surgery,cardiac surgery, and coronary angiography).
737,785,786The
evidence that withholding RASi would lower perioperative
AKI is less consistent as affected by fewer studies with low
sample sizes.787,788In the surgical context,
antihyperglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas, metformin,and SGLT2i would be held because of fasting before thesurgery. Case reports, case series, and a systematic review of47 cases
739,740,789support the current recommendations that
SGLT2i should be withheld at least 3 –4 days before the
elective surgery.741,742
Temporary discontinuation of medications to manage
adverse events is indicated in most cases. However, fear foradverse event recurrence often results in failure to resumetreatments. In CKD, hyperkalemia or AKI are not uncommonadverse effects of RASi treatment, to which clinical guidelinesrecommend discontinuation of RASi and therapy reinitiationat low dosages when the event is resolved.
23,29,790,791Despite
this advice, permanent discontinuation of RASi seems to be
the most common clinical reaction to occurrence of adverse
events.580,792Observational studies consistently show that
withholding RASi medication compared with continuingtreatment after these adverse events is associated with alower recurrence of adverse events, but conversely a higherrisk of MACE and death, for which prevention is one of themain indications for RASi.

In all these situations, enhanced communication with the
patients, and between inpatient and outpatient teams, is neces-
sary to ensure resumption of medications in a timely manner.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Many children with CKD with un-
derlying tubular disorders have an obligate urine output irre-
spective of their hydration status and are at particularly high risk
of hypotension and AKI during an acute dehydrating illness.Therefore, temporary discontinuation of medications such asdiuretics and RASi that may lead to serious complications ofvolume depletion, such as hypotension and AKI, should beconsidered during illnesses. If medications are discontinuedduring an illness, a clear plan of when to restart the discontinuedmedications should be communicated to people with CKD and
documented in the medical record.
4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship
Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with
CKD regarding the expected bene ﬁts and possible risks of
medications so that they can identify and report adverse
events that can be managed.
People with kidney disease have a role in drug stewardship,
and given that they may receive medications from non-
nephrology healthcare providers, people with CKD should beencouraged to inform those prescribers that they have kidneydisease to facilitate consideration of doses and potential sideeffect of medications. Thus, education and information forpeople with CKD inclusive for their population (i.e., literacy
level and languages) are encouraged. Although brochures and
conversations may be useful, interactive electronic healthapplications have been shown to be acceptable to patients andmay lead them to apply the knowledge gained more effec-tively.
793–797Practical implementation tips involve printing
out the results of the most recent eGFR estimation for thepatient to bring along in future healthcare consultations and/or write down a list of ongoing medications to alert other
healthcare providers of medication risks and bene ﬁts.
A diagnosis of CKD should always be re ﬂected in medical
records, as this will alert physicians on the need to consider
adjusting or avoiding certain medications or procedures.Under-recognition of CKD diagnoses in medical records isassociated with medication errors, including potentiallyinappropriate prescription of nephrotoxic medications.
729
Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationshipswith other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/oruse tools to ensure and improve drug stewardship in peoplewith CKD to enhance management of their complexmedication regimens.
Clinical pharmacists are highly quali ﬁed experts in medi-
cines and, as part of the multidisciplinary team, can play apivotal role in improving the quality of care and ensuring
patient safety in a range of ways. This includes carrying out
structured medication reviews for people with CKD andassociated health problems and improving patient safety,outcomes, and value through a person-centered approach.
798–
800In addition and where clinical pharmacists are not avail-
able, clinical decision support systems can optimize thisprocess through automation and decision support integratedinto the EMRs, supporting drug stewardship through alerts to
healthcare providers on the need for dose adjustment to
prevent adverse effects. In RCTs enrolling people with CKD,electronic clinical decision support systems have demon-strated ef ﬁcacy in reducing medication errors, avoiding drug-
drug interactions, and improving dose adjustment of medi-cations excreted by the kidneys.
801–806Recognizing that many
of these tools may not be available in all communities, theconcepts of regular review and evaluation of medications by a
knowledgeable healthcare provider are a critical component
of care for people with CKD.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations. Parents and carers should be cen-
tral to drug stewardship for children with CKD, withincreasing involvement from the young person as they movetoward transition.
4.4 Imaging studies
Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imagingstudies in accordance with general population indications.Risks and bene ﬁts of imaging studies should be determined
on an individual basis in the context of their CKD.
The use of iodinated radiocontrast media has been asso-
ciated with the occurrence of AKI, with varying rates reportedin observational studies depending on the population studied,the type, route and dose of agent being used, and the de ﬁ-
nition of nephrotoxicity. The term “contrast-induced AKI ”
has been traditionally coined to describe this condition,
807but
subsequent research characterizing this entity suggests causallinks to be weak,
807–809and the term “contrast-associated AKI
(CA-AKI) ”has been suggested instead.
Although there is potential risk for AKI with contrast
administration in people with CKD G4 –G5, caution should be
exercised in withholding contrast treatment or evaluation of apotentially fatal condition solely based on GFR.

may be induced through delaying, not performing, or
providing suboptimal diagnostic/therapeutic imagingprocedures due to fear of contrast-associated complicationsto people with reduced GFR.
811,812Table 33813describes the
potential causes of CA-AKI identi ﬁed in available studies that
may suggest an approach to people with CKD.
4.4.1 Radiocontrast: intra-arterial and intravenous dye studies
Practice Point 4.4.1.1: Assess the risk for AKI in peoplewith CKD receiving intra-arterial contrast for cardiac
procedures using validated tools.
The reported risk of CA-AKI is higher with procedures
involving arterial administration compared with venous
administration of contrast.
814This difference in risk may be
due to differences in patient populations (those who requirearterial contrast are likely to have comorbidities thatincrease the likelihood of AKI) or to differences in thenephrotoxicity of intra-arterial contrast material.
Known risk factors for CA-AKI are advanced age, heart
failure, the volume of contrast material, proteinuria, hyper-glycemia, and use of RASi.
815The highest risk for AKI is
associated with interventional (rather than diagnostic)coronary angiography (particularly in the setting of acutemyocardial infarction). This may relate to the highervolume of contrast used in interventional procedures andhemodynamic instability associated with the clinical
situation.
815–817
Practice Point 4.4.1.2: The intravenous administration of
radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance withconsensus statements from the radiology societies in peoplewith AKI or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m
2(CKD G3a –G5)
undergoing elective investigation.
The Work Group refers the reader to the most recent
radiology guidelines speci ﬁcally noting the difference between
intravenous and intra-arterial radiocontrast:
/C15Use of low-osmolality contrast media and iso-osmolaritycontrast media/C15Use of minimum radiocontrast dose to achieve a diagnosticstudy
/C15Withdrawal of nonessential potentially nephrotoxic medi-cations (e.g., NSAIDs, diuretics, aminoglycosides, ampho-
tericin, platins, zoledronate, and methotrexate) in people
with AKI or eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m
2for 24 –48
hours before and 48 hours after radiocontrast exposure
/C15In people with eGFR >30 ml/min per 1.73 m2and without
evidence of AKI, metformin need not be stopped beforeiodinated contrast media (ICM) administration, and thereis no need for testing to evaluate GFR afterward. For peoplewith AKI or an eGFR #30 ml/min per 1.73 m
2, it remains
appropriate to stop metformin at the time of or before ICMinjection and should not be restarted for at least 48 hoursand only then if GFR remains stable and the ongoing use ofmetformin has been reassessed by the clinical team.
818
/C15Given the lack of strong evidence demonstrating thatcontinuing RAASi is bene ﬁcial, referring healthcare pro-
viders should consider withholding RAASi in people at riskfor$48 hours before elective contrast-enhanced CT to
avoid the potential for hypotension and hyperkalemiashould CA-AKI develop. RAASi may be restarted if CA-AKIdoes not occur or after the return of GFR to baseline.
/C15Consideration of avoiding dehydration for people not un-dergoing dialysis and who have eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73

/C15Use of N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, furosemide, dopa-mine, fenoldopam, or calcium channel blockers as pre-
ventative measures of CA-AKI has not been shown to be a
consistent bene ﬁt.
813
/C15Prophylactic pericontrast hemodialysis has been shown tobe potentially harmful and is not recommended.
813
Special considerations
Global access to contrast agents. The preference of contrast
agent may depend on availability and cost, particularly inlower-income countries and lower-middle –income countries.
4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast media
Gadolinium chelates used during magnetic resonance imag-ing has previously been reported to cause nephrogenic sys-temic ﬁbrosis (NSF) before 2010, and the mechanisms have
been articulated.
820Note that incidence of this condition has
not been reported later than 2012, thus raising the question asto the true risk of this condition.
821
Practice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min
per 1.73 m2(CKD G4 –G5) who require gadolinium-con-
taining contrast media, preferentially offer them AmericanCollege of Radiology group II and III gadolinium-basedcontrast agents.
People who are at greatest risk for NSF include those with
AKI, undergoing KRT, and those with CKD G4 –G5. Most

media (e.g., gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and
gadoversetamide), and there is additional risk with repeateddoses.
822,823
Hence, in people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the
use of newer linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-basedcontrast media such as gadobenate dimeglumine, gadobutrol,gadoteridol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoxetate disodiumshould be preferred.
824,825
Special considerations
Global access to gadolinium-contrast agents. There are cost
implications in lower-income countries and lower-middle –
income countries as the nonlinear-chelated preparations aremore expensive.
Pediatric considerations. Considerations speci ﬁc to the use of
gadolinium preparations in young children and neonates mustalso be contemplated in addition to the general admonishmentsagainst their use in situations of GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m
2.
In particular, the FDA currently does not license any gadolin-ium-based contrast media product for use in children <2 years
of age and, likewise, the European Medicines Agency cautionsagainst the use of any gadolinium-based contrast agents in achild<1 year of age. The risk of NSF in pediatric populations
appears to be low, but data are limited.
822,823In recognition of the inability to accurately measure GFR
in the neonate and, by extension, the clearance of compoundssuch as gadolinium, all nephrologists and radiologists mustexercise caution in terms of use of gadolinium-based contrast
media in this potentially high-risk population, and all other
imaging modalities should be considered before choosing onerequiring gadolinium exposure. Although not based on spe-ciﬁc evidence, some have suggested the avoidance of high-risk
gadolinium agents in very young children (e.g., neonatesyounger than 4 weeks of age).
826
Moreover because of kidney immaturity in fetuses, neo-
nates, and infants, this population (and consequently preg-
nant women because of the risk to the fetus) is considered
potentially at risk for NSF.827However, although the data are
limited, the number of reported cases of NSF in the pediatricpopulation is lower than in the adult population.
828There
is no convincing evidence that pediatric populations havea ni n c r e a s e dr i s kc o m p a r e dw i t ha d u l t s .T h er i s ko fN S Fin pediatric patients appears to be low, but data arelimited.

Chapter 5: Optimal models of care
5.1 Referral to specialist kidney care services
Early identi ﬁcation and referral to specialist kidney care ser-
vices for people with CKD has the potential to reverse, delay,
or prevent progression of disease and is a key focus of in-ternational initiatives in the context of the global “epidemic ”
of kidney disease. The goals of early identi ﬁcation and referral
to specialist kidney care services are several-fold and include:
/C15Ensuring a speci ﬁc diagnosis for CKD is sought, where
appropriate
/C15Provision of speci ﬁc therapy based on diagnosis
/C15Slowing/arresting CKD progression
/C15Evaluation and management of comorbid conditions
/C15Prevention and management of CVD
/C15Identi ﬁcation, prevention, and management of CKD-spe-
ciﬁc complications (e.g., malnutrition, anemia, bone dis-
ease, and acidosis)
/C15Planning and preparation for KRT (e.g., choice of modality,access-placement and care, and preemptive transplantation)/C15Psychosocial support
/C15Provision of conservative care and palliative care optionswhere required.
Practice Point 5.1.1: Refer adults with CKD to specialistkidney care services in the circumstances listed inFigure 48 :
The scope of nephrology practice includes a wide variety of
conditions, not only kidney failure but also acute and chronic
primary and systemic diseases involving individual elements
of the kidney, resistant hypertension, and biochemical de-rangements. Thus, there are many potential bene ﬁts of
nephrology referral in addition to those more commonlyrecognized such as identi ﬁcation of reversible causes of CKD,
provision of treatment to slow progression of CKD, man-agement of the metabolic complications of CKD, and prep-aration for dialysis and transplantation.
Central to achieving the best outcomes for people with
CKD regardless of the reason for referral is timeliness.

Referral to specialists for assessment does not necessarily
equate to access to or need for multidisciplinary care, anddifferentiation of the value of each is important. Specialistreferral to aid in ascertainment of cause and prognosis can be
seen as separate from care and support services targeted at
complications, and delay of, and preparation for progressiveCKD. Application of risk prediction tools (Chapter 2) may aiddecision-making in terms of identifying those at risk ofprogression and determining action thresholds for multidis-ciplinary care and placement of access for KRT or referral totransplantation. Current recommendations to use validatedrisk equations to ascertain those at high probability of kidney
failure within 2 years should prompt actions that align with
provision of appropriate education activities, review of un-derstanding, and decision-making, and prompting referrals toother healthcare providers (e.g., vascular access surgeons,transplant teams, etc.).
Risk-based referral was compared with guideline referral
criteria in a cross-sectional study from the UK.
829Analysis
revealed that approximately 40% of patients classi ﬁed as at
high risk of progression to kidney failure by KFRE ( >3% by 5
years) were missed by guideline referral criteria. Moreover, amodel predicting the timing of clinical outcomes, validated ina multicenter prospective cohort study of 1517 people aged$65 years with eGFR 10 –30 ml/min per 1.73 m
2, showed
good performance for predicting the timing and occurrenceof KRT. Using this prediction model to guide referral forvascular access preparation resulted in less unnecessary
arteriovenous ﬁstula surgeries than using eGFR thresholds.
830
In this section, we consider the evidence relating to timely
referral for planning KRT in people with progressive CKD.
The literature concerning late referral has been remarkablyconsistent with both clinical studies and narrative reviewsidentifying several adverse consequences of late referral andrelated bene ﬁts of early referral ( Table 34 ).
Both individual and healthcare system factors are associ-
ated with late referral for KRT planning. A systematic reviewof 18 studies and physician surveys identi ﬁed speci ﬁc factorsresponsible for late referral for KRT as shown in Table 35 .
831
We encourage each nephrology program to explore factorsassociated with late referral to improve referral patternsappropriately.
People with kidney disease have never been randomized to
early or late referral to nephrology services, and the de ﬁnition of
late referral in the published studies varies between 1 and 12months before the start of KRT. Three months is probably lessthan the absolute minimum amount of time required forassessment, education, preparation for KRT, and creation ofaccess, but 3 months is the most frequently employed de ﬁnition.
A systematic review of 40 studies showed that early referral
was associated with better clinical and biochemical outcomessuch as improvement in mortality at 3 and 5 years, decrease inhospitalizations, better access to vascular access and KRT withperitoneal dialysis, as well as improvements in BP , hemoglobin,and serum albumin ( Table 36 ).
832A retrospective study of
105,219 patients (early referral 21,024 patients and late referral84,195 patients) showed that early referral to nephrology carewas associated with slower progression of CKD as signi ﬁcantly
more patients in early referral group did not change their CKDstage (65% –72.9% vs. 52% –64.6%, P<0.05).
833
Local practice and resources will dictate local referral
practices. Regardless of the healthcare system, delay, or pre-vention of progression of both CKD and its complicationswill be of value to both individuals and healthcare systems.Local organizations will determine the best methods ofcommunication and interaction between people with CKD,
kidney care specialists, the multidisciplinary team, and pri-
mary care physicians.
Technology may be used to promote appropriate
nephrology referral. Embedding clinical practice guidelinesinto clinical information systems may effectively create areminder system for primary care physicians. Clinical deci-sion support systems could also improve referral criteriaadherence. The smartphone application, Nefroconsultor,
which uses KDIGO referral criteria was shown to increase the
rate of appropriate referral by 28.8%.

Implementation of referral guidelines will inevitably lead
to an increased workload for specialist kidney care services.
However, introduction of local initiatives in conjunction with
primary care providers can improve the appropriateness and
quality of the referral. A checklist for goal-directed care inCKD should be considered. Local initiatives combined withnational policy and practice changes can lead to animprovement in the outcomes for people with CKD regard-less of the level of resources available.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
Practice Point 5.1.2: Refer children and adolescents tospecialist kidney care services in the followingcircumstances:
/C15an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol) or a PCR of 200 mg/g(20 mg/mmol) or more, con ﬁrmed on a repeat ﬁrst
morning void sample, when well and not duringmenstruation,
/C15persistent hematuria,
/C15any sustained decrease in eGFR,
/C15hypertension,
/C15kidney outﬂ ow obstruction or anomalies of the kidney
and urinary tract,
/C15known or suspected CKD, or
/C15recurrent urinary tract infection.Children with known or suspected CKD or who are at risk
of CKD (as outlined above) should be referred to specialistcare. This allows for timely investigations and diagnosis. Earlyintegration of children with CKD into nephrology services
will ensure optimal management of pediatric complications
of CKD (including growth restriction) and will promote ac-cess to preemptive transplantation (the KRT of choice).
5.2 Symptoms in CKD
5.2.1 Prevalence and severity of symptoms
CKD confers a high burden of uremic symptoms that may beunder-recognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.
835As
kidney disease progresses, affected people experience anincreasing burden of adverse uremic symptoms. Thesesymptoms can impair their health-related QoL (HRQoL) byinterfering with social relationships, ﬁnancial instability, and
contributing to overall poor well-being.
836Patient-reported
outcomes, including HRQoL and symptoms, are oftenidenti ﬁed by people with CKD as more important to them
than clinical outcomes, such as survival.
837,838A recent
systematic review of 126 patient-reported outcome studiesinvolving people with CKD G1 –G5, not on KRT, identi ﬁed the
most common symptoms experienced in terms of prevalenceand severity in this population ( Figure 49 ).
839The most
prevalent symptom reported in the CKD population noton KRT was fatigue at 70% (95% CI: 60% –79%), whereas in
the identi ﬁed control population without CKD, fatigue
prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 0% –70%). In terms of the
symptoms reported as the most severe, sexual dysfunction hadthe highest severity score. This review also looked atpopulations receiving dialysis and/or transplantation, allowingfor the comparison of prevalence and severity across
populations. This provides insight into symptoms that may be
attributable to changing or deteriorating kidney function andmay provide symptom targets for tracking in the care ofpeople with CKD, especially those with more advanced CKD,such as CKD G5.
5.2.2 Identi ﬁcation and assessment of symptoms
Practice Point 5.2.2.1: Ask people with progressive CKDabout uremic symptoms (e.g., reduced appetite, nausea, andlevel of fatigue/lethargy) at each consultation using a stan-dardized validated assessment of uremic symptoms tool.
The identi ﬁcation and assessment of symptoms in people
with progressive CKD are important for highlighting changesin clinical management,
840redirecting treatment toward
patient-centered management, and may lead to discussionabout appropriate supportive care options.
838Effective 2-
way communication and shared decision-making should bekey principles between healthcare providers and the peoplethey treat, allowing them to work in partnership to identify
symptom burden, possible treatment strategies, and person-
centered solutions.

those with CKD, and patient reports of their HRQoL are still
rarely routinely recorded, despite increasing recognition oftheir importance.
841–843In addition, many of the assessments
developed have been for people on dialysis, with little vali-dation in CKD populations not on KRT. In 2019, Verberneet al.
841described an international standard set of outcome
measures for people with CKD, developed in conjunction
with people with very high –risk CKD G3 –G5. Within this
standardized set of outcome measures, there are 4 domains,
with one of the domains targeting 6 patient-reportedoutcomes for HRQoL (fatigue, pain, general HRQoL,physical function, depression, and daily activity). To date,there is no consensus on a single preferred patient-reportedoutcome measure (PROM) instrument to be used to assessthese symptoms. However, 3 generic tools have been
recommended by the International Consortium for Health
Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) ( Table 37 ).
The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informa-
tion System (PROMIS) tool has been evaluated in adults andchildren with CKD, evidencing suf ﬁcient validity andreliability.
844–846Further study is still needed to investigate its
optimal use in routine nephrology care.
5.2.3 Management of common symptoms for people with CKD
Practice Point 5.2.3.1: Use evidence-informed managementstrategies to support people to live well with CKD andimprove their health-related quality of life.
The goal of effective symptom management in people
with CKD is to assist them to live better with kidney disease,regardless of life expectancy, within a supportive care
framework.
838Unpleasant symptoms, such as CKD-
associated pruritis and emotional/psychological distress,
often occur within symptom clusters and treating onesymptom may potentially alleviate other symptoms.

population or people on hemodialysis. For example, sexual
dysfunction, a very common and one of the most severesymptoms described by people with CKD, is fraught withbarriers in terms of research from agreement of de ﬁnitions,
the stigma of sexual dysfunction, acknowledging thedistinction between sex and gender, discordance betweenresearch priorities and patient priorities, and understandingthat there are variable responses to treatment in peoplewith CKD.
847However, there has been some consensus
that there is suf ﬁcient evidence to support guidance for
some symptoms such as uremic pruritis, sleep disturbances,pain, depression, and restless leg syndrome,
838but future
research is needed to understand the determinants ofsymptoms such as chronic pain and evaluation ofmanagement strategies.
848Table 38838,840,849–871provides an
overview of the most common symptoms in CKD.
Practice Point 5.2.3.2: Screen people with CKD G4 –G5, aged
>65, poor growth (pediatrics), or symptoms such as invol-
untary weight loss, frailty, or poor appetite twice annually
for malnutrition using a validated assessment tool.
Practice Point 5.2.3.3: Enable availability of appropriate
medical nutrition therapy for people with signs of malnu-trition, ideally under the supervision of renal dietitians or
accredited nutrition providers if not available.

In different world regions, 11% –50% of adults and 20% –45%
of children with CKD have malnutrition characterized by pro-
tein energy wasting (PEW).872–874In a European cohort of 1334
adults over the age of 65 years with CKD G4 –G5, 25% were
found to have moderate malnutrition, and the risk was increasedwith advancing age, female gender, and psychiatric disease.
875
Malnutrition can happen at any stage of CKD and is associatedwith a higher morbidity and mortality, loss of muscle mass,and in ﬂammation. It can also be associated with worse
outcomes with kidney transplant.
874The risk of PEW increasesas CKD progresses but is also in ﬂuenced by comorbid
conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and CVD.PEW is thought to be driven by the damaging effect of uremictoxins on appetite and chronic in ﬂammation.
873–875Given the
impact on prognosis and QoL, nutritional assessment andintervention (ideally by a renal dietitian or accredited nutritionprovider) using a validated assessment tool should beundertaken for people with CKD who present with frailty, age>65 years, weight loss, poor growth (pediatrics), poor
appetite, and all people with CKD G4 and G5 ( Table 39

5.3 Team-based integrated care
Practice Point 5.3.1: Enable access to a patient-centered
multidisciplinary care team consisting of dietary coun-
seling, medication management, education, and counseling
about different KRT modalities, transplant options, dialysisaccess surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social carefor people with CKD.
An optimal care model leads to the best outcomes for the
individual, the population, and the community. The model ofcare varies according to CKD severity and risk of progressionto kidney failure, which will determine the target population
and goals ( Figure 50 ).
CKD models of care follow the same principles embodied
in the chronic disease model of care ( Figure 51
879). Each keycomponent of the chronic care model is applied to the CKD
care model.
The speci ﬁc components for CKD models of care are
presented in Figure 52 and include:
(i) Navigation system that leads to appropriate and
timely referral. This relies on a good healthcare system
(ii) An education program that includes both general
CKD and KRT education, including conservativemanagement, where appropriate
(iii) Surveillance protocols for laboratory and clinic visits,
attention to cardiovascular comorbidities, and CKD-associated comorbidities such as anemia, a vaccina-
tion program
(iv) Management that includes self-care management
particularly lifestyle modi ﬁcation including diet,Table 39 | List of validated assessment tools for malnutrition
Validated malnutrition assessment tool Attributes
7-Point Subjective Global
Assessment (SGA)876Provides assessment points on weight change, dietary intake, digestive function, functional capacity,and metabolic stress. A nutrition focused physical examination is also performed. This updated versionof the SGA is more sensitive to short-term nutrition changes. A score of 1 –2 indicates severe malnutrition,
3–5 is mild malnutrition, and 6 –7 indicates normal nutrition status.
Malnutrition-In ﬂammation Score
877Assesses malnutrition and in ﬂammation using 10 parameters including dietary intake, anthropometric
measurements, laboratory indices, and functional capacity. The score ranges from 0 (normal) to30 (severe malnutrition and in ﬂammation).
Mini Nutrition Assessment
878Includes assessment of dietary intake, mobility, neuropsychology, and some anthropometric measurements,including weight and calf circumference. A score of 12 –14 points indicates normal nutrition status,
8–11 indicates at risk for malnutrition, and 0 –7 points indicates malnutrition.

to individual needs, circumstances, and resources, see text for
details.
Standardized educational topics should cover 3 main
subject areas: knowledge about CKD, knowledge about
treatment to slow progression and complications of CKD, andknowledge about the kidney failure management options.
Educational material should be written and explained
clearly with plain language. Customization of information topatient needs and literacy level, and sensitive to cultural
norms and needs (i.e., storytelling/videos vs. written mate-
rials). A multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged asan effective strategy for providing education. Engaging com-munity healthcare workers and other health educationproviders may be an effective strategy for providing patient/
carer education and empowering self-care management.
883
Targeting education to people with CKD who are at high
risk of CKD progression might yield a better outcome thanroutine care not only to the individual but also to thehealthcare system. Engaging with family members orcaregivers in a CKD education program will facilitate self-care management and psychosocial support.
Practice Point 5.3.3: Consider the use of telehealth tech-
nologies including web-based, mobile applications, virtualvisiting, and wearable devices in the delivery of educationand care.1. Create standardized educational material

Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S263
Telehealth has been used increasingly in medicine,
including nephrology, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Telehealth has the potential to augment patient care in CKDin many aspects such as improving access to CKD care in
outreach patients, increasing patient monitoring ability,
helping with healthcare provider shortage, and improvingpatient satisfaction. Telehealth in nephrology ( “Tele-
nephrology ”) can be categorized into 3 main areas: (i) remote
monitoring, (ii) providing education, and (iii) delivery ofcare. These have been implemented in 4 main platformsincluding internet web-based, smartphone applications,interactive video conferencing, and wearable technology.
Remote monitoring technology has been designed to
promote self-care management through oversight of clinicalparameters so people with CKD can monitor changes athome, such as BP , body weight, or abnormal symptoms.
884,885
This may encourage people with CKD to participate in themanagement of CKD.
Telehealth technologies that enhance education in people
with CKD have been reported in various forms. Web-based
applications are probably the most popular platform used to
provide education for people with CKD and their families.
886
Systematic reviews suggest that web-based CKD materials aremostly adequate but not written at a suitable literacy level formost people with CKD.
887,888
Smart phone applications have been increasingly adopted
for patient education in CKD. Educational material can beinstalled into smartphone applications as a tool for on-de-
mand knowledge. Moreover, smartphones applications that
provide self-care management support for people with CKDwere reported in a pilot study.
889The application targeted 4
key self-care management parameters: monitoring BP,medication management, symptom assessment, andtracking laboratory results. Lastly, interactive videoconferencing can provide patient education simultaneouslywith a virtual visit.
890,891This strategy should not be
intended to replace the clinic visit but would be helpful fordealing with any event that happens between follow-upface-to-face visits, such as follow-up of clinical symptomsafter starting or adjusting medication. Examples oftelehealth technologies that were studied in people withCKD are shown in Figure 54 .
Standardized and culturally appropriate protocols should
be considered. Although it is recognized that resources may
vary across and within jurisdictions, the recommendations
here are based on principles of care, which should be relevantacross the globe.
CKD is a complex condition that coexists with many other
conditions. Therefore, models of care should be developedthat integrate the complexity of the clinical conditionsinvolved, patient-centered philosophies, and the healthcareenvironment. The principles of care are universal, but
implementation may be customized to speci ﬁc circumstances.
Special considerations
Pediatric considerations.
5.3.1 Transition from pediatric to adult care
5.3.1.1 Pediatric providers
Practice Point 5.3.1.1.1: Prepare adolescents and their
families for transfer to adult-oriented care starting at 11 –14
years of age by using checklists to assess readiness andguide preparation, and by conducting part of each visitwithout the parent/guardian present ( Figure 55 ).
Practice Point 5.3.1.1.2: Provide a comprehensive writtentransfer summary, and ideally an oral handover, to thereceiving healthcare providers including all relevant med-ical information as well as information about the youngperson ’s cognitive abilities and social support ( Figure 55 ).
Practice Point 5.3.1.1.3: Transfer young people to adult careduring times of medical and social stability where possible.
Although several organizations have made recommendations
about transition from pediatric to adult care, there have been norandomized trials to test the effectiveness of speci ﬁca p -
proaches.
892–894Nevertheless, there is general agreement that
preparation for transfer to adult care should start as early as 11years of age and certainly by 14 years when possible.

readiness (i.e., TRxANSITION, Y outh Quiz from the On Trac
program, Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire(TRAQ), Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ), andGot Transition tools http://www.gottransition.org ) are useful
to identify the areas of weakness.
896–899Young people should
gradually be prepared for full autonomy with medical visits.
Seeing the young person alone before inviting caregivers into
the room allows young people to practice interacting withhealthcare providers independently and provides privacy forthe discussion of sensitive topics.
Good communication between the transferring and
receiving care teams is a cornerstone of successful transitions.A comprehensive written medical summary must be provided;a verbal handover is ideal. Because childhood CKD may be
associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities, a clear
description of the young person ’s cognitive abilities, including
strengths and weaknesses that may in ﬂuence their ability for
self-care management, is critical. Information about socialsupport available to young people is also important.
Healthcare transitions are well known to be strongly
associated with adverse outcomes, including loss to follow-up.Transferring during periods of instability is ill-advised and
may amplify the risk of poor outcomes.
894To minimize the
risk of loss to follow-up, pediatric care providers should
follow-up with patients to ensure that they have engagedwith the new care team.
Transition clinics may improve the outcomes of young
people transitioning from pediatric to adult care.
900,901
Transition clinics may be staffed exclusively by pediatriccare providers and focus on preparation, or may be jointly
staffed by pediatric and adult providers.
895,902Although
joint pediatric-adult clinics are viewed as ideal, their
superiority has not been demonstrated in randomized trials.Furthermore, feasibility may be limited by funding,geography, and staf ﬁng. Young people should have the
opportunity to visit the adult clinic before transfer.5.3.1.2 Adult providers
Practice Point 5.3.1.2.1: Recognize that young people under25 years of age with CKD are a unique population at highrisk for adverse outcomes at least in part due to physiologicincomplete brain maturation.
Practice Point 5.3.1.2.2: Encourage young people to infor-
mally visit the adult care clinic to which they will be
transferred before the ﬁrst appointment ( Figure 55 ).
Practice Point 5.3.1.2.3: Assess young people with CKDmore frequently than older people with the same stage ofCKD and, with the agreement of the young person, includethe caregivers or signi ﬁcant other of the young person in
their care, at least in the ﬁrst 1– 3 years following transfer
from pediatric care ( Figure 55 ).
Even for young people without chronic illness, the interval
between 14 and 25 years of age is a period of change andincreasing autonomy. Young people with CKD undergoingtransfer to adult care must navigate 2 transitions simulta-
neously: the transition of care and the larger transition from
childhood to adulthood. Development of the prefrontal cor-tex, responsible for planning, organization, and impulsecontrol, continues to approximately 25 years of age. Adultcare providers must recognize that young adults constitute ahigh-risk population requiring special care.
903Outcomes are
poorer during this interval than at other times of life.904
Care must re ﬂect the fact that this is a high-risk period.
An informal visit to the new clinic setting may help in
reducing stress, improving engagement, and reducing loss tofollow-up.
895In the initial years after transfer, visits should be
more frequent than for older adults with the same stage ofCKD to provide an opportunity for care providers to establisha relationship with the young person, reduce the risk of loss tofollow-up, improve adherence to medications, and provide

enhanced monitoring of a group at high risk of adverse
outcomes. Although young adults must have an opportunityto meet their care providers alone, many will continue todesire and need involvement of parents or signi ﬁcant others in
their care. This is a normal part of development, is associatedwith better outcomes, and should be encouraged.
895
Multidisciplinary young adult clinics including youth
workers, social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists inaddition to physicians and nurses may be bene ﬁcial.
900Peer-
support programs have also shown promise.904
5.4 Timing the initiation of dialysis
Practice Point 5.4.1: Initiate dialysis based on a compositeassessment of a person ’s symptoms, signs, QoL, prefer-
ences, level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities.
Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one
or more of the following situations is evident ( Table 41 ).
This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR rangebetween 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m
2.
Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive
kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults
when the GFR is <15–20 ml/min per 1.73 m2or risk of
KRT is >40% over 2 years.
These statements are worded very precisely to highlight the
need to plan proactively for complex activities related toinitiation of KRT. Also, there is a need to address symptomsand to avoid the institution of dialysis therapy at an arbitrarynumber representing the degree of residual kidney function.
Given the risks and bene ﬁts of KRT, as well as the potential
imprecision of measurements, people with CKD need to be
treated according to symptoms and signs, not simply basedon laboratory values. Data from the Initiating Dialysis Earlyand Late (IDEAL) RCT show no survival advantage to earlystart dialysis (i.e., at higher levels of GFR).
905Thus, the
statement as written should help the healthcare provider tobalance symptoms with laboratory values in decision-making.
Secondary analyses of the IDEAL study showed no signi ﬁ-
cant difference in QoL or healthcare– related cost between early
and late start dialysis groups.
905,906Moreover, subgroup
analysis of the IDEAL study revealed no bene ﬁts on cardiac
outcome in the early-start dialysis group.907Since the IDEAL
study, there were a number of large sample size observationalstudies with an advanced statistical technique to reducepossible confounding factors and biases encountered in
previous observational studies.
908–910The overall results wereconsistent with the IDEAL study and showed no bene ﬁts of
early-start dialysis compared with late-start dialysis in regard
to mortality and hospitalization risk ( Table 42905–909).
Factors such as availability of resources, reasons for starting
dialysis, timing of dialysis initiation, patient education andpreparedness, dialysis modality and access, as well as varied“country-speci ﬁc”factors signi ﬁcantly affect a person ’s expe-
riences and outcomes. As the burden of kidney failurehas increased globally, there has also been a growing recogni-tion of the importance of patient involvement in determiningthe goals of care and decisions regarding treatment. It isimportant to move away from a “one-size- ﬁts-all”approach to
dialysis and provide more individualized or personalized care.
The availability of resources for formal multidisciplinary
teams, educational materials, and access to specialized counselingfor diet, advance directives, access planning, and preemptivetransplantation varies around the world. These statements areproposed so that “best practices ”can be documented or aspired
to. The need for education, planning, and appropriate expertisefor the management of this patient group is internationally
relevant. The methods, frequency, and tools with which this can
be accomplished will be region speci ﬁc.
There is a need to focus on regular symptom assessment as
part of the CKD review in those with lower eGFR values.Individual assessment and availability of resources will dictatespeciﬁc timing of therapies. Healthcare providers should be
aware of the impact of early dialysis start on QoL beforerecommending this strategy to people with CKD.
Recognition that the planning of smooth transition to
either dialysis or transplantation from advanced CKD re-quires alignment of multiple different resources and activities,as such the planning for these will be situation speci ﬁc. It is
important to recognize that there is variability in the avail-ability of vascular access services or peritoneal dialysis cath-eter insertion for those who choose hemodialysis orperitoneal dialysis, respectively, and access to preemptive
transplantation. The complexity of the decision-making and
different teams and resources required to effectively transitionpeople often requires time, and thus the recommendation tobegin “planning of KRT ”is intentionally advised at a con-
servative time point.
Special considerations

Practice Point 5.4.5: Pursue living or deceased donor pre-
emptive kidney transplantation as the treatment of choicefor children in whom there is evidence of progressive andirreversible CKD. The eGFR at which preemptive trans-plantation should be undertaken will depend on multiplefactors including the age and size of the child and the rateof progression of kidney failure but will usually be between
eGFR 5– 15 ml/min per 1.73 m
2.
In children, poor growth can also be a reason to initiate
dialysis. The decision to start dialysis should be reached in
discussion with the child (if age appropriate), their caregivers,and their healthcare providers. Medical and psychosocialpreparations for the initiation of dialysis should begin wellbefore dialysis is required.
Deferred initiation should not imply deferred preparation,
and early discussions regarding medical and psychosocialpreparation for the initiation of dialysis should not be delayed(e.g., placement of dialysis access, dialysis modality
selection, advance care planning, and assistance with home
therapies).
In children, studies from the USRDS, the European Society
of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN), and the Australia and NewZealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) foundno bene ﬁt from starting dialysis early.
911–913Of 15,000 inci-
dent children on dialysis in the USRDS, the mortality risk was36% higher for those with eGFR >10 ml/min per 1.73 m

compared with those with lower eGFR at dialysis initiation.912
Mortality risk increased in those starting dialysis with eGFR<5 and$12 ml/min per 1.73 m

people 6 years and older.914A retrospective ESPN study of
nearly 3000 children found that mortality did not differwhen dialysis was started with an eGFR above or below 8ml/min per 1.73 m

5.5 Structure and process of supportive care and
comprehensive conservative management
Practice Point 5.5.1: Inform people with CKD about the
options for KRT and comprehensive conservative care.
Practice Point 5.5.2: Support comprehensive conservative
management as an option for people who choose not topursue KRT.
Practice Point 5.5.3: Provide access to resources that enable
the delivery of advanced care planning for people with arecognized need for end-of-life care, including those peopleundergoing comprehensive conservative care.
These statements are intended to highlight the importance
of supportive care and the need for comprehensive conser-vative care processes and resources in the care of this complexpatient group. The term supportive care in nephrology meanscare that is focused on improving the HRQoL for people withCKD at any severity or age and can be provided along withtherapies intended to prolong life, such as dialysis.
838
Although typically considered in people with advanced
kidney disease, supportive care may be applicable to people
in earlier CKD stages. Whereas comprehensive conservativemanagement is usually referred to as active medicalmanagement in people with kidney failure who choose notto have KRT. There are 3 distinct groups of people withkidney failure who receive comprehensive conservative carebecause provision of supportive care differs for each.
915
Descriptions of each group are shown in Table 43 .
There is increasing recognition that provision of organized
care to those who are dying or choose to not pursue KRT is ofvalue to people with CKD and their families. Healthcareproviders involved in caring for these people should be aler-ted to this need.
Comprehensive conservative care is an alternative treat-
ment to KRT. This is planned, holistic, person-centered carethat includes the full integration of comprehensive conser-
vative care including the following:
/C15Detailed communication including estimating prognosis
and advance care planning
/C15Shared decision-making
/C15Active symptom assessment and management
/C15Psychological, social, family, cultural, and spiritual support/C15Interventions to delay progression and minimize risksof adverse events or complications, but not includingdialysis.
Evaluating the prognosis of each person with CKD is very
important because each person has a different disease pro-gression pattern. Patient prognosis is the key information forshared decision-making in CKD G5, which requires unbiasedinformation on survival and person-centered outcomesknown to matter to people with CKD: QoL, symptomburden, and support from family and healthcare providers.Shared decision-making helps healthcare providers, peoplewith CKD, and family members to reach agreement on the
treatment direction that is appropriate with the person ’s
values and preferences and family goals. This process should
be performed in a culturally appropriate way with consider-ation of appropriate health literacy.
As CKD progresses, the person with CKD will experi-
ence more symptoms and complications related to CKD.Therefore, active symptom assessment and managementare the key components of comprehensive conservative
care in CKD G5. Assessing a person ’ss y m p t o m so na
regular basis helps redirect management toward a person ’s
values and preferences and family goals. There is limited
evidence for selecting treatment strategies due to thecomplexity of CKD and differences in people and theconsiderable variation in the management strategies fordifferent symptoms. Intervention to delay progression ofCKD is still an important component of comprehensive
conservative care in both CKD-related aspects (maintain
residual kidney function and reduce cardiovascularmorbidity) and psychospiritual aspects (the person andtheir family members do not feel that active CKD treat-ment is discontinued).
Advanced care planning (ACP) is a process under the
comprehensive conservative care umbrella that involves un-derstanding, communication, and discussion between a per-
son with CKD, the family, caregiver, and healthcare providers
for the purpose of clarifying preferences for end-of-life care.End-of-life care is the treatment during the phase where deathis inevitable. It focuses on QoL not quantity of lifetime.Functional and cognitive decline that may happen along withCKD progression results in dif ﬁcult end-of-life conversations
involving people with CKD, families, and healthcare pro-viders. Therefore, an integrated approach to timely ACP and

palliative care spanning the continuum of CKD care is
needed. End-of-life care is underused in the management ofpeople with CKD G5 due to inadequate education duringnephrology training leading to poor end-of-life care discus-
sions with the person. The overall concept of supportive care,
comprehensive conservative care, and end-of-life care isshown in Figure 56 .
In different societies or cultural areas, the form and
structure of this care may vary tremendously, and familiesor religious organizations may be able to deliver suitableand sensitive care. The details here are listed not to beprescriptive but rather to articulate the best practices incommunities where resources may be available and to serveas a construct to review in those locations where resourcesare more limited.
ACP is thought to be a component of all comprehensive
chronic disease management. Thus, ACP discussions are notrestricted only to those choosing supportive care.

Chapter 6: Research recommendations
The last 30 years have seen an exponential growth in the
literature relating to kidney disease. However, despite thisinclusion of people with CKD in prospective RCTs, those withlower GFR remain under-represented. Before the KDIGO2012 CKD guideline, a low eGFR was an exclusion criterionfor almost every large cardiovascular and BP trial. As a result,we had a largely opinion-based literature. That is changing,
and although still low, the proportion of the total CKD
literature that is either an RCT, meta-analysis, or systematicreview has doubled from 3.3% to 6.5% of published articlesin the 5-year period ending December 2022.
Several large international interventional studies have
been completed in the last 8 years, either speci ﬁcally tar-
geting people with CKD and other comorbidities (mostnotably diabetes or CVD), or with CKD de ﬁned by eGFR
and ACR criteria (e.g., Canagli ﬂozin and Renal Endpoints in
Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation[CREDENCE],
514DAPA-CKD,513EMPA-KIDNEY,403
FIGARO-DKD,534and FIDELIO-DKD533). Interventional
studies targeting speci ﬁc pathways and diseases are
increasing as well, though limited in scale due to rarity ofconditions (e.g., IgAN, membranous nephropathy, andsystemic lupus erythematosus, etc.).
There remain gaps in the evidence base to inform best
diagnostic testing strategies, decision-making, and processesof care. In addition, some therapies offering promise have notyet been adequately tested in people de ﬁned by speci ﬁc
criteria with CKD (i.e., people without diabetes, children,women, PKD, frail, elderly, etc.) and people from low-incomeand low-middle-income countries. We, therefore, begin thissection detailing research recommendations with some gen-
eral guiding principles for those designing studies to consider
when addressing key questions that impact people living withor at risk for CKD.
Guiding principles for research
1. To ensure that the evidence base is directly applicable to
all people with CKD, future studies should avoid auto-matic exclusion of older people, children, and youngadults<18 years old, and give consideration to pregnant
and lactating people. The need for contraceptive re-quirements for trial participation should also be reviewed.
2. Decreased GFR should not be a reason for automatic
exclusion from research studies.
3. Estimating equations equally applicable to those with and
without CKD are required for children and adolescents.4. For new equations predicting CVD and mortality
risk as well as CKD progression, development andimplementation studies including validation in differentpopulations (geographic and demographic) arerequired.
5. Bene ﬁt-risk ratio assessments of old, new, and future
medications should be performed by levels of GFR and
ACR and/or using validated risk equations.
6. Drug studies evaluating pharmacodynamics should
consider using validated eGFR equations or mGFR for
highly toxic drugs with a narrow therapeutic window,especially for those frequently used in CKD. As this maybe prohibitively expensive for some medications, epide-miologic studies may provide information for revisions tolabels for some drugs.
7. Pharmacokinetic studies in people with CKD should not
automatically exclude GFR categories G4 and G5.
8. Studies should consider measurement of ACR in all co-
horts, whether speci ﬁcally focused on CKD or not, given
additional prognostic value of this parameter for so manyoutcomes.
9. All studies should ensure attention to etiology of CKD,
sex, gender, age, and SES considerations in design and
analysis of results.
10. Use of novel study designs (platform, registry-embedded,
and pragmatic trials), use of large administrative datasets,
and implementation science methodologies (e.g., causalinference techniques) should be considered to enable theassessment and evaluation of interventions, processes, andmodels of care.
11. People living with CKD should be involved in clinical
studies throughout the research process from identi ﬁca-
tion of knowledge gaps to knowledge mobilization andstudy design.
The following set of more speci ﬁc research recommenda-
tions are organized according to chapter and are notexhaustive. They are generated in part from identifying gapsin knowledge during the evidence review and in part fromclinical practice and patient perspectives.

Commissioning of Work Group and ERT. KDIGO and the
Co-Chairs assembled and engaged a Work Group withexpertise in pediatric, adult, and geriatric nephrology,including both dialysis and transplant specialists; primarycare; internal medicine; dietetics; nursing; women ’s health;
clinical trials; epidemiology; medical decision-making; andpublic health; as well as people living with CKD. Johns
Hopkins University, with expertise in nephrology, evidence
synthesis, and guideline development, was contracted as theERT and was tasked with conducting the evidence reviews.The ERT coordinated the methodological and analyticalprocesses of guideline development, including literaturesearching, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, evidence
synthesis and meta-analysis, grading the certainty of the evi-
dence per critical outcome, and grading the overall certaintyof the evidence for the recommendations. The Work Groupwas responsible for writing the recommendations and theunderlying rationale, grading the strength of the recom-mendations, and developing practice points.
Deﬁning scope and topics and formulating key clinical ques-
tions. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was reviewed by the
Co-Chairs to identify topics to be included in the 2024guideline. Scoping reviews of these topics were conducted bythe ERT to provide an overview of the available evidence baseand to identify existing relevant systematic reviews.
The Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was
used to assess the risk of bias of the existing reviews. Whenhigh-quality systematic reviews were identi ﬁed during the
scoping reviews, the ERT conducted an updated search based
on the existing review and extracted information from the
newly identi ﬁed studies. This information was added to the
existing review data and analyzed as appropriate.
For topics that did not map to current high-quality re-
views, de novo systematic reviews were undertaken. Protocols
for each review were developed by the ERT and reviewed bythe Work Group. Protocols were registered on PROSPERO(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ). Systematic reviews
were conducted in accordance with current standards,including those from the Cochrane Handbook.

Details of the Population, Intervention, Comparator,
Outcome and Study design (PICOS) of the questions are pro-vided in Table 44 .
23,316,318,415,511,609,920–926Information about
existing reviews that were used is included in these tables.
For some topics not prede ﬁned in the Scope of Work, the
ERT extracted the certainty of evidence from existing high-
quality systematic reviews, as available. Details of the PICOS
for these questions are also provided in Table 44 .
Literature searches and article selection. Searches for RCTs
were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the CochraneCentral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), andsearches for diagnosis/prognosis studies were conducted onPubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. For topics with availableexisting reviews, the review was used and an updated search
was conducted. The search strategies are provided in
Appendix A :Supplementary Table S1 .
To improve ef ﬁciency and accuracy in the title/abstract
screening process and to manage the process, search resultswere uploaded to a web-based screening tool, PICO Portal(www.picoportal.net ). PICO Portal uses machine learning to

included RCTs. For these reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2
tool was used to assess risk of bias for RCTs based on the
randomization process, deviations from the intended in-terventions, missing outcome data, measurement of theoutcome, and selection of the reported results.
927
The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies
(QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess study limitations ofdiagnostic studies based on the following items
928:
/C15Could the selection of patients have introduced bias (pa-
tient selection)?
/C15Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have
introduced bias (index test)?
/C15Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpre-tation have introduced bias (reference standard)?
/C15Could the patient ﬂow have introduced bias ( ﬂow and timing)?
/C15Applicability
/C15Are there concerns that the included patients and
setting do not match the review question?
/C15Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct,
or interpretation differ from the review question?
/C15Are there concerns that the target condition asdeﬁned by the reference standard does not match
the question?
The ROBIS tool was used to assess risk of bias in sys-
tematic reviews based on study eligibility criteria, identi ﬁca-
tion and selection of studies, data collection and studyappraisal, and overall risk of bias.
929All risk-of-bias assessments were conducted independently
by 2 members of the ERT, with disagreements resolved byinternal discussion and consultation with a third ERT mem-ber, as needed.
Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Measures of treatment
effect. For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled effect estimate
was calculated as the RR between the trial arms of RCTs, witheach study weighted by the inverse variance, using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird formula for
calculating between-study variance.
930For continuous
outcomes, a standardized mean difference was calculated by
using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian andLaird formula.
930
Data synthesis. Meta-analysis was conducted if there were 2
or more studies that were suf ﬁciently similar with respect to
key variables (population characteristics, study duration, andcomparisons).
We combined studies of interventions in the same class
when reporting outcomes. If there was substantial heteroge-neity (I
2>50%) in pooled estimates for any outcome, we
stratiﬁed by the type of intervention before conducting the
pooled analyses.
Pooled sensitivity and speci ﬁcity was calculated using a
random-effects model in studies addressing biopsy diagnosisand prognosis using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine
transformation to calculate the pooled estimate.
931The
binomial exact method to calculate the CIs was used.932Included RCTs:

Assessment of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among the trials
for each outcome was tested using a standard c2test using a
signiﬁcance level of a#0.10. Heterogeneity was also assessed
with an I2statistic, which describes the variability in effect
estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than random
chance. A value greater than 50% was considered to indicatesubstantial heterogeneity.
933
Grading the certainty of the evidence and the strength of a
guideline recommendation. The certainty of evidence for each
critical outcome was assessed by the ERT using the GRADEapproach.
934,935For outcomes based on data from RCTs, the
initial grade for the certainty of the evidence is considered tobe high. The certainty of the evidence is lowered in the eventof study limitations; important inconsistencies in resultsacross studies; indirectness of the results, including
uncertainty about the population, intervention, outcomes
measured in trials, and their applicability to the clinicalquestion of interest; imprecision in the evidence reviewresults; and concerns about publication bias. Forimprecision, data were benchmarked against optimalinformation size,
936low event rates in either arm, CIs that
indicate appreciable bene ﬁt and harm (25% decrease and
25% increase in the outcome of interest), and sparse data
(only 1 study), all indicating concerns about the precision

evidence for an outcome could be high (A), moderate (B),low (C), or very low (D) ( Tables 45 and46).Summary of ﬁndings (SoF) tables. SoF tables were developed
using GRADEpro (https://www.gradepro.org/ ). The SoF ta-
bles include a description of the population, intervention, andcomparator and, where applicable, the results from the datasynthesis as relative and absolute effect estimates. The gradingof the certainty of the evidence for each critical outcome isalso provided in these tables. The SoF tables are available in

Updating and developing the guideline state-
ments. Recommendations from the KDIGO 2012 Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease were considered in the context ofnew evidence by the Work Group Co-Chairs and Work Group
members, and updated as appropriate.
1Practice points were
not yet proposed as a separate category in 2012, so the
KDIGO 2024 Work Group considered the followingoptions: where new evidence did not suggest a change tograded recommendations, the statements were retained asgraded recommendations; graded recommendations wereupdated where appropriate based on new evidence; existingrecommendations that ﬁt the criteria for practice points
were rewritten as practice points, and new guidelinestatements (both recommendations and practice points)were generated for new clinical questions from the 2024update.Table 45 | Classi ﬁcation for certainty of evidence
Grade Certainty of evidence Meaning
A High We are con ﬁdent that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect.
B Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
C Low The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
D Very low The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect.

Grading the strength of the recommendations. The strength
of a recommendation was graded by the Work Group as Level
1o rL e v e l2( Table 47 ). The strength of a recommendation was
determined by the balance of bene ﬁts and harms across all
critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overallcertainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences,
resource use and costs, and other considerations ( Table 48 ).
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. The Work Group determined
the anticipated net health bene ﬁt on the basis of expected
beneﬁts and harms across all critical outcomes from the
underlying evidence review.
The overall certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of
the evidence for each recommendation is determined by the
certainty of evidence for critical outcomes. In general, the
overall certainty of evidence is dictated by the critical
outcome with the lowest certainty of evidence.936This could
be modi ﬁed based on the relative importance of each
outcome to the population of interest. The overall certaintyof the evidence was graded high (A), moderate (B), low(C), or very low (D) ( Table 46 ).
Patient values and preferences. The Work Group included 2
people living with CKD. These members ’unique perspectives
and lived experience, in addition to the Work Group under-standing of patient preferences and priorities, informed de-cisions about the strength of the recommendations. Asystematic review of qualitative studies on patient prioritiesand preferences was not undertaken for this guideline.
Resources and other costs. Healthcare and non –healthcare
resources, including all inputs in the treatment managementpathway, were considered in grading the strength of arecommendation.
937The following resources were
considered: direct healthcare costs, non –healthcare resources
(such as transportation and social services), informalcaregiver resources (e.g., time of family and caregivers), andchanges in productivity. No formal economic evaluations,including cost-effectiveness analysis, were conducted.
Practice points. In addition to graded recommendations,
KDIGO guidelines now include “practice points ”to help
healthcare providers better evaluate and implement the guid-ance from the expert Work Group. Practice points are consensus
statements about a speci ﬁc aspect of care and supplement rec-
ommendations. These were developed when no formal sys-
tematic evidence review was undertaken or there wasinsufﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation.
Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guidelineWork Group, and they may be based on limited evidence.Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, a ﬁgure, or
an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice.
Format for guideline recommendations. Each guideline
recommendation provides an assessment of the strength ofthe recommendation (Level 1, “we recommend ”or Level 2,
“we suggest ”) and the overall certainty of the evidence (A, B,
C, D). The recommendation statements are followed by Keyinformation (Balance of bene ﬁts and harms, Certainty of the
evidence, Values and preferences, Resource use and costs,Considerations for implementation), and Rationale. Each
recommendation is linked to relevant SoF tables. An under-
lying rationale may also support a practice point.Table 47 | KDIGO nomenclature and description for grading recommendations

“We recommend”Most people in your situation would wantthe recommended course of action, andonly a small proportion would not.Most patients should receive therecommended course of action.The recommendation can be evaluatedas a candidate for developing a policyor a performance measure.
Level 2“We suggest ”The majority of people in your situationwould want the recommended courseof action, but many would not.Different choices will be appropriate fordifferent patients. Each patient needshelp to arrive at a managementdecision consistent with their valuesand preferences.The recommendation is likely to requiresubstantial debate and involvement ofstakeholders before policy can bedetermined.

Table 48 | Determinants of the strength of recommendation
Factors Comment
Balance of bene ﬁts and harms The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the more likely a strong recommendation
is provided. The narrower the gradient, the more likely a weak recommendation is warranted.
Certainty of the evidence The higher the certainty of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation is warranted. However, there are
exceptions for which low- or very low-certainty evidence will warrant a strong recommendation.
Values and preferences The more variability or the more uncertainty in values and preferences, the more likely a weak recommendation is
warranted. Values and preferences were obtained from the literature, where possible, or were assessed by thejudgment of the Work Group, when robust evidence was not identi ﬁed.
Resources and other costs The higher the costs of an intervention— that is, the more resources consumed —the less likely a strong
recommendation is warranted.www.kidney-international.org methods for guideline development

Limitations of the guideline development process. Two peo-
ple living with diabetes and CKD were members of the Work
Group and provided invaluable perspectives and lived expe-riences for the development of these guidelines. However, inthe development of these guidelines, no scoping exercise withpatients, searches of the qualitative literature, or formalqualitative evidence synthesis examining patient experiencesand priorities were undertaken. As noted, although resourceimplications were considered in the formulation of recom-
mendations, no economic evaluations were undertaken.methods for guideline development www.kidney-international.org
