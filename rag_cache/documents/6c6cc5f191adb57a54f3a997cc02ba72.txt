ynn B. Martin  and Courtney A. C. Coon  On an island off Scotland, variation in sheep i
mmune response imposes ﬁ  tness costs and b
e n e ﬁ t s .W
hy are infectious diseases still the ma
jor causes of animal mortality, d
espite the strong and ever-pres-e
nt evolutionary pressure to eliminate traits t
hat make individuals susceptible to infec-t
ion? Why hasn’t natural selection weeded out
 weak immune systems? An emerging and r
apidly growing ﬁ  eld, known as ecological i
mmunology or ecoimmunology, is trying to answer these questions by investigating how v
ariation in immune response in free-living a
nimal populations affects ﬁ  tness. On page 6
62 of this issue, Graham et al. ( 1) provide an
 illuminating answer for feral sheep liv-i
ng on the Scottish island of Hirta in the St. K
ilda archipelago. The sheep have varying b
lood levels of antibodies, and individuals w
ith higher levels appear to confront a ﬁ  t-n
ess trade-off: Although a strong immune r
esponse helps adult females survive harsh w
inters, it also reduces reproduction.One journal ( 2) has dedicated a spe-c
ial issue to ecoimmunology, another spe-c
ial issue ( 3) is forthcoming, and the U.S. N
ational Science Foundation recently f
unded a Research Collaborative Network (
www.ecoimmunology.org) to help shape t
he ﬁ  eld. Some of the ﬁ  rst papers in the area (
published just ~20 years ago) have been c
ited more than 1000 times ( 4,  5). Recently, in
vestigators have also begun to develop t
he study of human ecoimmunology ( 6– 8), w

pendent gating in CLC channels. Part of t
he evidence for the role of the gating gluta-m
ate comes from a series of structures of the E
scherichia coli CLC ( 4,  10). They show that t
he side chain of the gating glutamate alter-n
ately occludes ion access to the ion perme-a
tion pathway, or swings out of the way to be r
eplaced by a Cl− ion ( 4,  10). In the new struc-t
ure, the gating glutamate occupies a new pos
ition, projecting into the core of the pro-t
ein to displace Cl− from a different, deeper bi
nding site (see the ﬁ  gure).O
n the basis of this observation, Feng et al
. propose a novel mechanism; instead of the p
rotein undergoing a large conformational c
hange to enable transport, the movements of t
he gating glutamate alternately allow access t
o one side of the membrane or the other. T
his effectively makes it a “plunger” to expel bound C
l− to the cytoplasm and to deliver (or a
ccept) the transported proton well into the tr
anslocation pathway. This mechanism would r
equire only minimal conformational change, c
ertainly compared with the dramatic move-me
nts currently being described for other f
amilies of transporters (see the ﬁ  gure) ( 11,  
12). In CLC transporters, there is also evi-d
ence of transport-associated conformational ch
anges ( 13,  14), but the magnitude of those c
hanges is unknown. Other data, however, do s
upport a minimal change, most notably the l
ow activation energy of CLC transporters c
ompared with other transporters ( 15).A
nother remarkable property of the model p
roposed by Feng et al. is that it predicts a s
tate that has been considered forbidden for a
 transporter protein: an “open” channel-like state in which the protein contains a contin-uo
us aqueous pathway spanning the mem-br
ane. In a ﬁ  rst-order approximation, such a
 pathway couldn’t exist because it would a
llow the transported substrates to “slip,” or m
ove independently of each other down their c
oncentration gradients, thereby wasting the w
ork of the transporter. The new model avoids t
his slippage by invoking a kinetic barrier to mo
vement: Cl− ions encounter an energetic “h
ill” that prevents their rapid permeation. Suc
h an energy barrier could bypass the need f
or a physical barrier to prevent unwanted “
downhill” Cl− flux. As the authors point o
ut, an occasional Cl− ion sneaking through t
he transporter (on the order of 1/1000 ions) w
ould have minimal effects on coupled trans-po
rt. This open state is predicted to occur w
hile the gating glutamate is protonated and r
otated away from the ion path—it should t
hus be favored at low pH. The model there-f
ore predicts that coupling might be weaker a
t low pH than at high pH, a phenomenon not y
et observed for ClCec1, a well-studied CLC t
ransporter from E. coli ( 16). Y et uncoupling a
t low pH has been suggested for a mamma-l
ian CLC transporter, ClC-3, providing early s
upport for the new mechanism ( 17).P
erhaps the most compelling aspect of the ne
w transport model is that it offers a natural e
xplanation of the relationships between the t
ransporter and channel branches of the CLC f
amily. By postulating an open aqueous path-w
ay as an essential feature of the CLC trans-por
t mechanism, Feng et al. make it possible t
o imagine an evolutionary path to a chan-ne
l that might involve a change only in the kin
etic barrier to Cl− movement. As this bar-rier is reduced, uncoupled (but not coupled) t
ransport rates would increase dramatically. I
ndeed, a combination of two mutations along t
he transport path (including the gating gluta-m
ate) is sufﬁ  cient to raise uncoupled trans-por
t rates by almost a factor of 20 ( 18). Thus, F
eng et al.’ s model accounts for a large num-be
r of the confusing, paradoxical features of t
he CLC family and, to paraphrase Lao Tzu, r
eveals that it is on the space where nothing is t
hat the mechanism of the CLC depends. R

ine known as Darwinian medicine ( 9,  10).P
erhaps the most important contribution of
 ecoimmunology to date has been to explic-i
tly incorporate the costs of immune function in
to studies of how animals defend against p
arasites ( 5). Investigators have long known t
hat immune defenses are expensive in terms o
f calories and proteins ( 11), lost opportuni-tie
s (i.e., sickness preventing reproductive be
havior) ( 12), and self-damage due to misdi-r
ected or overactive immune responses ( 13). T
hese costs can be important from an evolu-t
ionary perspective, as populations selected f
or robust defenses often exhibit compara-t
ively slow growth or reproductive output ( 
14). Ecoimmunologists have brought these c
osts to the forefront and emphasized that the “b
est” immune system—the one expected to e
merge from most evolutionary processes—i
s not the strongest one; rather, it is the one th
at maximizes or maximized ﬁ  tness in light of
 constraints ( 14).G
raham et al. provide one of the best e
xamples so far of such “optimal immu-ni
ty” in a free-living animal population. They found that antibody responses were related to ﬁ
 tness in wild sheep, but in a complex way (
see the ﬁ  gure). Antibodies help control par-a
sites by interfering with their movement or r
eplication or by targeting them for elimina-t
ion by other immune cells. Given these func-t
ions, one might expect that “more is bet-t
er,” because more antibodies should mean f
aster elimination of more parasites. Some an
tibodies, however, can target the body’ s o
wn cells and proteins for destruction, mak-i
ng them progenitors of disease. In humans, a
utoimmune diseases, including lupus and t
ype 1 diabetes, are associated with overac-t
ive immune cells. This double-edged sword m
ay explain why, for some Soay sheep, less w
as more. Speciﬁ  cally, sheep that maintained t
he highest concentrations of antibodies suf-f
ered costs to fitness in the form of lower r
eproductive output: Male and female sheep w
ith high antibody concentrations in the fall, af
ter the breeding season, were unlikely to ha
ve produced offspring in the previous sea-s
on. But there were also beneﬁ  ts to antibody r
esponses: Females with high levels were more likely to survive harsh winters that are a
ssociated with high parasite burdens, and pr
oduced offspring more likely to survive the ne
onatal period. The key discovery, however, w
as that an intermediate immune response m
ay often be advantageous in wild animals.Gr
aham et al. also considered whether t
hese “collateral damage” costs promoted s
ome variation in antibody response. How-e
ver, the response they measured—levels of a
ntinuclear antibodies (ANAs) that bind to pr
oteins released from dying cells—did not pr
ovide a clear answer; high ANA levels also c
orrelated with antibody responsiveness to n
onself proteins, meaning that the immune s
ystem was also primed to oust invaders. As a
 result, the direct relevance of autoimmunity to
 ﬁ  tness in wild animals remains unclear, a
nd future investigations of this issue could p
rove useful, especially since many human a
ilments involve immune dysregulation ( 15).O
ther questions would also beneﬁ  t from c
ollaboration among eco- and traditional imm
unologists. What levels of antibodies, f
or instance, are needed to provide wild ani-m
als with protection against speciﬁ  c para-s
ites? What factors besides genes explain w
hy antibody responsiveness varies with age a
nd among individuals? Ecoimmunology is p
oised to make novel contributions to immu-nol
ogy ( 16), but collaborations between b
ench and field researchers are needed to r
eveal and explain the gamut of natural im
munological variation.  R

itness in the ﬂ  ock. Immune response in Soay sheep carries costs and beneﬁ  ts for survival and reproduc-t
ion. (A) Increasing parasite pressure (upward black arrow) should favor strong infection resistance mecha-ni
sms, such as an active immune system. But an immune system that produces high levels of antibodies that a
ttack the body’s own cells extracts a cost that favors weaker immune response (downward-pointing black a
rrow). The opposing trends suggest that animals should evolve optimal, not maximal, immunity. ( B) In Soay s
heep, the costs and beneﬁ  ts of immune defenses appear to drive variation in levels of antibody response. F
emales had greater antibody responses than males, and females with the greatest antibody response (green cu
rve) had the highest probability of surviving over the winter (upward black arrow on left), when exposure to p
arasites promotes mortality. But individuals of both sexes that had the highest antibody responses did not br
eed in the previous year (upward black arrow on right).PHOTO CREDITS: SHEEP , GINA PRIOR AND ARPAT OZGUL.10.1126 /science.1198303P
