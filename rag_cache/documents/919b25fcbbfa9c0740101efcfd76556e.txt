...................................................................................................................Comment on above table
It is a common finding that syncopal recurrences often decrease
spontaneously after medical assessment, even in the absence of a spe-
cific therapy. In general, >50% of patients with recurrent syncopal
episodes in the 1 or 2 years before evaluation do not have syncopalrecurrences in the following 1 or 2 years and, in those with recur-
rences, the burden of syncope decreases by >70% compared with
the period before. The decrease seems to be more evident whenthere is a lack of a clear anatomical substrate for syncope, such as in
the case of reflex syncope and unexplained syncope. The reason for
this decrease is not known. Several potential clinical, statistical, andpsychological explanations have been suggested, and all probably play
a role. The education and reassurance effect is probably the most likely
reason for the decrease in syncope. As a consequence of the diagnos-tic evaluation, the patient understands the mechanism of syncope
and is instructed on the recognition of the prodrome and triggers,
thus learning how to prevent recurrences or to limit the conse-quences of loss of consciousness. Closely related to the education
and reassurance effect is the expectancy effect .
79–81The subject-expect-
ancy effect is a form of reactivity that occurs in medical treatments
when a patient expects a given result, which unconsciously affects the
outcome, or reports the expected result. In the physician-expectancy
effect, the physician consciously or unconsciously influences patient
behaviour. The expectancy effect can only be presumed in syncope.
However, the expectancy effect of sham or placebo treatments
seem modest, if any, as in controlled trials reported in Supplementary
Data Table 10the recurrence rate with sham or placebo treatment
was not different from that with no treatment.82Finally, two pure
statistical explanations have been advocated. One is the ‘ Regression-
to-the-mean effect ’.83It is known that syncopal recurrence is not con-
stant, but fluctuates over time, peaking at the time of evaluation (pre-
test mean). If a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it willtend to be closer to the average on its second measurement (post-
test mean). Thus, even in the absence of any therapy, the incidence of
syncope in those under surveillance will regress towards themean.
84,85The second is the ‘Poisson distribution’. In patients with
frequently recurrent vasovagal syncope, the days were distributedrandomly in time with easily identifiable and idiosyncratic rate con-
stants that tightly fit Poisson distributions.86
