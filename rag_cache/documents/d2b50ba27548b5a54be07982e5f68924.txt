Despite continued research and education on malnutrition, challenges remain in accurately diagnosing and correctly 
documenting this diagnosis for patient and financial reimbursement benefit. 
This fact sheet provides strategies on how physicians, providers, dietitians, nutrition clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical 
documentation specialists can collaborate together to diagnosis and document malnutrition appropriately.

Make Sure the Diagnosis is Documented in the Medical Record
 Documentation Recommendations For Dietitian 
or Nutrition Clinician
Documentation Should Be Organized:
•Eas
y to locate recommended diagnosis and criteria
•Concise inter
vention list, noted as initiated or
recommended
•Concise sta
tement of context and risk factors
•Source of d
ata (weight, intake, etc.)
•Time, cont
ent, and audience for counseling
•Clear outline of follo
w-up/monitoring plan
Documentation Should Be Uniform:
•Predict
able format with information easily locatable
•Consider where t
o place the most sought-after
informationProvider –Documentation Specialist 
Workflow: Ensure Accurate, Complete and 
Appropriate Coding/Billing
“Coding a Diagnosis: the term PROVIDER is used throughout the ICD-10 guidelines to mean physician or any qualified health care practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis. The assignment of a diagnosis code is based on the provider’s diagnostic statement that the condition exists.”

Translation: MD, DO, NP, PA (provider) who is providing face to face care must document the diagnosis.
Competency Development and Training
Competency development and training are key for clinicians and clinical documentation staff. The subject areas to be covered include:
•
Educa
te dietitians on nutrition assessment steps
and documentation including NFPE
•Prov
ide a dietitian led in-service for new and
existing coders
•Ongoin
g education of CDI teams on malnutrition
•Educa
te providers via grand rounds, small provider
group presentations, fellows conference, and/or monthly
resident lectures Documentation Recommendations For Provider
Documentation Should Be Precise and Complete:
•Diagnosis and crit
eria met and clearly stated in the
assessment and care plan
•Include sev
erity
•Include clinic
al context
• Rele
vant to care
•Outline the impor
tance for the current clinical
episode
•Include tr
eatments provided regardless of who
ordered them
•Include monitor
ing and follow-up plan
Rule of Threes and Discharge Summary
•Consistentl
y maintain documentation of the
diagnosis throughout the record
•Document t
he diagnosis in the discharge summary
(final diagnostic statement)
•Problem list maintenanc
e: Ensure the diagnosis
and pertinent details follow the patient throughtransitions of careKEY MESSAGES
•Multidisciplinary approach
•Utiliz
e a uniform definition and criteria set for
diagnosis
•Part
ner with CDI department and coding for
documentation and query initiatives
•Unifor

•Prov
ider education and competency on both
clinical and documentation aspects of malnutrition
•Keep complianc
e informed
•Consider a clinic
al validation policy and pathway
•Base initia
tives, diagnosis, and coding on “best
practice” for clinical care
•Don’
t change clinical practice or definitions based
on denial or audit patterns
•Use EHR where possible t
o communicate findings
to provider in a standardized way.
