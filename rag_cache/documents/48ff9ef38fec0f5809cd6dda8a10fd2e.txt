Received in revised form 23 September 2016Accepted 11 October 2016Background: The HEART score has been validated as a predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in
emergency department patients complaining of chest pain. Our objective was to determine the extent of physi-cian variation in the HEART score of admitted patients strati ﬁed by years of experience.
Methods: We performed a retrospective medical record review at an academic tertiary care emergency department
to determine HEART score, outcome of hospitalization, a nd 30-day MACE. Electrocardiograms were graded by con-
sensus between 3 physicians. We used analysis of varianc et od e t e r m i n et h ed i f f e r e n c ei nm e a nH E A R Ts c o r e sb e -
tween providers, Fisher's exa ct test to determine difference in MACE by duration of training, and logistic regression
to determine predictors of low-risk admission (HEART score ≤3).
Results: T h ea v e r a g em e a nH E A R Ts c o r ef o r1 9f u l l - t i m ep h y s i c ians was 4.41 (SD 0.43). Individually, there was no
difference in mean scores ( P= .070), but physicians with 10-15 years of experience had signi ﬁcantly higher
mean scores than those with 0-5 years of experience (mean HEART score 4.65 vs 3.93, P= .012). Those with 10-
15 years of experience also had a signi ﬁcantly higher proportion of MACE in their admitted cohort (15.3%, P= .002).
Conclusions: More experienced providers admitt ed higher-risk patients and were m ore likely to admit patients who
would experience a MACE. More research is needed to determine whether adding the HEART score for clinical de-
cision making can be used prospectively to increase sens itivity for admitting patients at high risk for MACE and to
decrease admissions for chest pain in lower-ri sk patients by less experienced providers.

1. Introduction
There are more than 8 million patient visits for chest pain annually in
the United States [1]. Patients presenting to the emergency department
(ED) with chest pain are often admitted to the hospital for serial troponintesting and provocative cardiac stress testing. Risk strati ﬁcation for ad-
mission or discharge is often done by gestalt or Thrombolysis in
Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scoring [2], which may often result in a
risk score that is too high for many emergency physicians to tolerate. At-
tempts to identify a higher proportion of low-risk chest pain patients for
safe discharge have also included the modi ﬁed Goldman score [3,4].T h e
HEART score and serial negative troponin testing are a recently validated
tool speci ﬁcally designed to help risk stratify ED chest pain patients as
high risk, needing in-hospital admission, or low risk, with potential for
discharge home from the ED without provocative testing [5,6].
There is known physician variability by admission percentages for
many common inpatient conditions [7,8] . There is also variation be-
tween hospitals for chest pain admissions, and reducing this may safely
result in cost savings [9,10] . Admission rates for chest pain have beenshown to vary depending upon individual physician risk tolerance,
and such variation could possibly be reduced by using a validated risk
scoring tool rather than solely relying on clinical gestalt [7,11] .H E A R T
scoring was introduced at our institution as part of the electronic med-
ical record (EMR), and we were interested in evaluating its utility in oururban population. We hypothesized that there would be signi ﬁcant var-
iation among providers for the percentage of ED chest pain admissions
with low (0-3), medium (4-6), or high (7-10) HEART scores and that
this variation would be seen between physicians with differing years
of experience.
2. Methods
This study was a retrospective medical record review at a single ter-
tiary care teaching hospital in the mid-Atlantic region with 90 000 an-nual visits and a predominantly African American patient population.
Patients were included for study if they were admitted for outpatient
observation through the ED with a diagnosis of “chest pain ”

intentionally limiting to capture the population most eligible for dis-
charge from the department were they to have had a low risk score as
opposed to chest pain presentations that were not considered for
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rule out or had severe comorbid admis-
sion criteria. There were no exclusion criteria based on age or
preexisting conditions. Because the study was conducted at an adult-
only ED, only patients older than 18 years were eligible for the study.
Data were abstracted by trained medical student reviewers from the
hospital's EMR with each abstracted medical record reviewed and
scored by study physicians. Starting in December 2014, reviewers
worked backward reviewing every eligible medical record in the last 6
months of the year. The number of medical records per physician was
then tallied, and additional patients were collected in reverse order as
needed to total 30 patients for each of the 19 BCBE emergency medicine
physicians working in the ED at that time. The initial ED visit, subse-
quent events during hospitalization, and repeat visits to the study hos-
pital or to second city hospital in the same health care system
documented within the EMR were reviewed. Social security records
were also reviewed to attempt to capture any additional deaths within
30 days.
The HEART score, in the manner previously described by Backus et al
[5], was determined based on the treating emergency physician's histo-
ry and physical documentation, laboratory values, and medical history
recorded in the EMR for the visit. Patient history was classi ﬁed as slight-
ly suspicious (0 points), moderately suspicious (1 point), or highly sus-
picious (2 points) by the medical record reviewer based on the presence
or absence of history elements, such as description of the pain as tight orpressure-like; lateralization of the pain; relief of pain with nitrates; stat-
ing that pain felt like previous ACS episode; diaphoresis; shortness of
breath; or associated arm, neck, or jaw symptoms. Symptoms were
not weighted for scoring purposes, but the constellation of symptomsrecorded was reviewed by 1 of 2 emergency physician authors to deter-
mine the “H”component of the score in line with clinical gestalt. The κ
score for reviewer agreement was 0.83. Electrocardiograms were each
reviewed by 2 emergency physician authors and scored on the criteria
previously described by Backus et al [5]. Agreement was seen on scores
for 91% of cases, and arbitration was provided by a third senior author.
Troponin scoring was performed in the manner of Backus et al [5]
using the Siemens LOCI Cardiac Troponin I Assay with a 99th percentile
limit of b0.045 ng/mL considered negative.
The HEART score has been validated as a predictor of ACS and major
adverse cardiac event (MACE) in ED patients presenting with chest pain
and has performed better than other tools at identifying patients who
may be safely managed in a cost-effective manner outside of the hospi-
tal[12]. MACE is a composite end point as described by Backus et al [5]
that combines percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary ar-
tery bypass grafting, acute myocardial infarction, and death which
were recorded from patient medical records through the EMR. For pa-
tients discharged, follow-up admissions were examined for delayed
MACE, which was recorded if occurring within 30 days of discharge.
Statistical analysis was performed with Stata (Version 14; StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX). We used 1-way analysis of variance to compare
mean HEART scores by individual providers and then performed a
planned secondary analysis grouping providers by years of experience
into 4 groups (0-5 years of experience, 5-10 years of experience,
10-15 years of experience, and N15 years of experience). We used
Fisher's exact test to compare rates of MACE between groups of pro-
viders by years of experience. We used logistic regression to ﬁnd predic-
tors of low-risk (HEART score ≤3) patients placed in outpatient
observation. The study was approved by our institutional review board.
3. Results
A total of 771 eligible medical records were reviewed in the process
of collecting 30 medical records each for the 19 full-time BCBE ED phy-
sicians. Demographics for the reviewed medical records are presented
inTable 1 . Notably, race was recorded as black for 83% of patients,Table 1

consistent with the hospital's predominantly African American patient
population. Mean age for the study population was 60.0 years (SD
13.9). HEART scores were derived and found to be low risk in 31% of pa-
tients (232/771), intermediate in 61% (472/771), and high risk in 9% of
patients (69/771).
The overall MACE rate was 7%, including 1 death in the high-risk
group. Fig. 1 presents the incidence of MACE in the study population
with 27 of 58 MACEs occurring from PCI. Total MACEs strati ﬁed by
risk scores are presented in Table 2 . A HEART score ≤3 had a negative
predictive value of 98% for MACE. Patients with MACE had mean
HEART scores of 5.4 (SD 1.5) compared with 4.3 (SD1.6) in non-MACE
patients. Fig. 2 presents MACE events strati ﬁed by calculated HEART
score. In addition, the group of patients with low-risk HEART scores
b4 could have been further risk strati ﬁed with serial troponin testing
(the “modi ﬁed HEART score ”) because, among this group of 232 pa-
tients, only 10 had a positive repeat troponin test result during admis-sion which identi ﬁed 2 patients that ultimately received PCI. Twenty-
one patients in this group did not have a repeat troponin drawn but
sustained no MACE, yielding a MACE rate of 3 of 201 (1.5%) in low-
risk patients with negative serial troponin test result.
To compare mean provider HEART scores, the last 30 admissions of
2014 for each of 19 full-time BCBE physicians were extracted from the
data set and further analyzed. The mean HEART score in this group
was 4.41 (SD 0.43), with a physician range of 3.66 to 5.10. Taken indi-
vidually, there was no difference in physician mean scores ( P=. 0 7 0 ) ,
but on planned secondary analysis, the group of physicians with 10-15
years of experience had signi ﬁcantly higher mean scores than thosewith 0-5 years of experience (mean HEART score 4.65 vs 3.93, P=
.012). Fig. 3 presents a box-plot comparison of these differences. To con-
ﬁrm that this variation was not solely attributable to the more subjec-
tive history component of the HEART score, 1-way analysis of variance
testing was repeated using only the “H”score for providers which re-
vealed no signi ﬁcant variation.
MACE rates in the admitted cohorts were strati ﬁed by experience,
and the group of physicians with 10-15 years of experience had a signif-
icantly higher proportion of MACE (15.3%, P= .002) in their admitted
patients as compared to all other experience groups (0-5 = 5.6%, 5-
10 = 5.1%, 15 and up =6.7%).
Fig. 4 presents the proportion of low-risk admissions that occurred
strati ﬁed by years of physician experience. Physicians with less than 5
years of postresidency training were found to admit a signi ﬁcantly
higher proportion of low-risk patients in their admitted cohort ( P=
.028) when compared with other experienced cohorts (0-5 = 39%, 5-1 0=2 8 % ,1 0 - 1 5=2 5 % ,1 5a n du p=3 3 % ) .
4. Discussion
In this retrospective study, the HEART score performed similarly to
prior studies for risk strati ﬁcation of ED chest pain patients in a predom-
inantly African American patient population. Use of the HEART score
classi ﬁed 29% of patients as being low risk (score ≤
3), consistent with
prior studies, with a MACE rate in this group of 2%, slightly higher
than reported in the validating studies [2,5]. Other studies have found
that discharging patients with low HEART scores does not increase the

rate of MACE compared to inpatient workup, particularly when com-
bined with serial troponin testing in the ED [13,14] . The practice of rou-
tine admission and emergent or urgent noninvasive testing has been
called into question by a number of recent studies that have demon-
strated a low yield of such testing and a low absolute rate of adverse
events, as well as a high rate of false-positive noninvasive testing
[15-17] . In patients with lower HEART scores, outpatient cardiology
follow-up may reduce costs associated with admission while lowering
risk of overdiagnosis and invasive testing or procedures. There was a
signiﬁcant increase in MACE for medium- and high risk patients in our
cohort who were appropriately admitted for inpatient care after,
which is also consistent with prior studies.
There was no signi ﬁcant difference between the mean HEART scores
of the 19 individual providers studied. However, the group of least ex-
perienced physicians, those with 0-5 years of experience postresidency,
was more likely to admit patients with HEART scores ≤3, usually consid-
ered low risk compared with the other physician cohorts. Compared
with providers with 10-15 years of experience, the least experienced
physician group also admitted patients with lower mean HEART scores.
It is not clear whether this difference represents a change in clinical ge-
stalt with experience or a difference in risk perception or risk tolerance
at different stages in one's career. Past studies have shown that pro-
viders generally overestimate the likelihood of severe causes of chest
pain [18]. Objective risk strati ﬁcation using the HEART score may help
mitigate this overestimation and close the gap between more and less
experienced physicians.
Our study had several important limitations. Medical records were
reviewed for a single ED, which limits generalizability of our results.
The retrospective nature of our study meant that HEART scores were
not recorded a priori by the treating clinician, which limits its direct ap-
plicability to the real-time clinical environment. Only patients placed in
outpatient observation were analyzed as part of our cohort, and it is not
clear how patients discharged may have differed. In addition, one of our
primary outcomes of MACE at 30 days was limited by loss to follow-up if
patients did not return to an af ﬁliated institution after their initial inpa-
tient stay. Prior studies have however shown that the incidence of
short-term ACS is very low after inpatient objective cardiac testing
and that almost all cases of MACE when they do occur happen during
the initial hospitalization [19].5. Conclusion
In our retrospective analysis of HEART scores in an urban ED, more
experienced physicians admitted higher-risk patients and were more
likely to admit patients who would experience a MACE. Being a new
provider (0-5 years after residency) was associated with increased ad-
mission of low-risk chest pain patients. Further research is needed toprospectively evaluate these differences in physician experience to see
if objective risk strati ﬁcation using the HEART score may help close
this gap. This would contribute to a safe and more cost-ef ﬁcient man-
agement of selected chest pain patients in the outpatient setting.
