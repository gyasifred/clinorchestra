Background The European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism
(PE) developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS) has been updated in 2019.
Recommendations were added or updated on all stages of the evaluation and management of pulmonary embolism,
encompassing diagnosis, early treatment, and long-term management................................................................................................................................ ....................................................................
Case summary We illustrate an exemplary case, assembled for the purposes of this review, of a 70-year-old woman who pre-
sented at the emergency department with dyspnoea and thoracic pain. She was diagnosed with intermediate–high-
risk acute PE and promptly treated with low molecular weight heparin. After 24 h of stay in intensive care unit, shewas transferred to the cardiology department and switched to non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant apixa-
ban 10 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and then 5 mg b.i.d. After discharge from the hospital 8 days later, she received standard-
dose apixaban 5 mg b.i.d. for 6 months; the dose was reduced to 2.5 mg b.i.d. for long-term secondary prevention.During follow-up, investigations for PE sequelae were performed due to persisting dyspnoea.
............................................................................................................................... ....................................................................
Discussion This exemplary case report puts into context the main novel recommendations from the 2019 ESC Guidelines, includ-
ing the combination of clinical (pre-test) probability and adjusted D-dimer cut-offs for diagnosis of acute PE, the keyrole of right ventricular dysfunction in risk stratiﬁcation, the choice and dosage of oral anticoagulant agents in early and
extended anticoagulation, and the identiﬁcation and management of chronic sequelae in the long-term follow-up.

..................................................................... Introduction
In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), developed with
the endorsement of the European Respiratory Society (ERS), pub-lished the new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute
pulmonary embolism (PE)
1updating the previous version from
2014.2
In this article, we present an exemplary case of acute PE with the
aim of putting into context and discussing some of the novel recom-mendations concerning PE management from the 2019 ESCGuidelines. The updates most likely to affect clinical practice include
the combination of clinical (pre-test) probability and adjusted D-
dimer cut-offs for diagnosis, the role of right ventricular dysfunctionin risk stratification, the choice and dosage of oral anticoagulantagents in early and extended anticoagulation, and the identification
and management of chronic sequelae in the long-term follow-up. The
readers will follow the case as it unfolds with each clinical decisionaccompanied by a discussion of the recommendations supporting it.
Timeline
Case presentation
A 70-year-old non-smoker Caucasian woman with
arterial hypertension presented with a two-day his-tory of dyspnoea and thoracic pain. Her bloodpressure was 130/65 mmHg; heart rate was 112
beats per minute; peripheral oxygen saturation
was 98 %on room air and the respiratory fre-
quency was 36/min. The remainder of her physical
examination was normal, including soft, non-
tender calves; her body weight was 75 kg. Shedescribed the chest pain as moderate and exacer-
bated by deep breathing. Dyspnoea was present atrest at the time of evaluation. Two weeks before,
she had suffered an ankle sprain that required bedrest with bathroom privileges for a few days. The
patient denied any previous personal or family his-
tory of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events orany additional risk factors for VTE.
Routine tests included electrocardiogram (sinus
tachycardia with negative T waves V2-V4), chest X-ray (normal findings), arterial blood gas (pO2 59mmHg, pCO2 32 mmHg, normal pH and bicarbon-
ate level). High-sensitivity troponin T was 52 ng/mL
(normal range: <14 ng/mL) and NT-proBNP was
610 pg/mL (normal reference range <100 pg/dL).
The physicians at the Emergency Department cal-
culated the Wells score, which was 3 (1.5 points forimmobilization and 1.5 for tachycardia), indicatingan intermediate pre-test probability of PE, Therefore,
a D-dimer test was performed that returned a level
of 1060 ng/mL (normal reference range <500 ng/
mL). Administration of low-molecular-weight heparin(LMWH) at therapeutic dose was promptly started.
The diagnostic workup of PE without haemodynamic instability
begins with the assessment of the patient’s clinical (pre-test) probabil-
ity of PE, which encompasses a combination of clinical findings and
the evaluation of predisposing factors for venous thromboembolism(VTE). The Wells and the Geneva score, or their simplified versions,
are simple and extensively validated prediction rules to assess the
patient’s probability of having acute PE.
3,4Specifically, the Wells score
includes seven items regarding clinical history, symptoms, and signs
suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE. The 2019 ESC
Guidelines endorse their use with a recommendation Class I and alevel of evidence B (I, B). Their assessment serves to (i) initiate antico-
agulation without any delay in patients with high or intermediate clin-
ical probability of PE (I, C); (ii) perform an imaging test in patientswith a high or intermediate clinical probability of PE; (iii) test D-dimerHOSPITAL STAY 3 MONTHS FOLLOW -UP 6 MONTHS FOLLOW -UPDay 1 –Emergency department

.............................................................................................................................................................................levels in patients with a low clinical probability, in order to decide
whether to perform computed tomography pulmonary angiography(CTPA) or a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scan.
In case of low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, guidelines
recommend plasma D-dimer measurement (I, A). In contrast, D-dimer testing is not recommended in patients with high clinical prob-ability of PE as a normal test does not safely exclude PE (III, A) and,therefore, a CTPA or a V/Q lung scan should be done without delay.
As the D-Dimer was above the age-adjusted cut-off
of 700 ng/nL (for a patient aged 70 years), the physi-cians decided to perform an urgent CTPA. The
CTPA showed multiple bilateral segmental pulmon-
ary emboli and right ventricle enlargement.
A novelty of the 2019 ESC guidelines is the introduction of two
alternatives (both rated as IIa, B) to a fixed D-dimer cut-off with theaim of increasing the specificity of D-dimer testing without affectingits sensitivity, thus reducing the number of patients unnecessarily
undergoing CTPA. The first alternative is an age-adjusted D-dimer
cut-off (age /C210 mg/L, in patients aged >50 years), the second is the
YEARS decision rule, which adapts the D-dimer cut-off measured atthe time of clinical assessment to the clinical probability as assessedby a simplified Wells score with only three items.
5,6
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the imaging
method of choice in patients with suspected PE.7Pre-test clinical
probability heavily influences both its negative and its positive predict-ive value. Accordingly, guidelines recommend rejecting the diagnosisPE if CTPA is normal in patients with a low or intermediate clinicalprobability of PE (I, A), accepting the diagnosis of PE if CTPA is posi-
tive in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability (I, B).
The possibility of findings supporting alternative diagnoses is an ad-
vantage of CTPA over other imaging modalities. However, a study on
patients undergoing CTPA for suspected PE found that findings sup-
porting an alternative diagnosis only rarely had therapeutic conse-quences.
8Therefore, physicians should be aware that an
inappropriate use of CTPA without a solid diagnostic work-up mayhave a limited value in the global management of the patient.
The echocardiogram confirmed right ventricle en-
largement (RV/LV: 1.1 with a normal range consid-
ered to be below 1.0) with increased systolic
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAPs: 42 mmHg),decreased tricuspid systolic velocity (TAPSE; 14 mm)and decreased tricuspid annular peak systolic (S’)velocity ( <9.5 cm/s) on tissue Doppler imaging;
McConnell’s sign was absent while the 60/60 sign
was positive. The patient was admitted to the inten-sive care unit (ICU) for 24-hour monitoring.
Diagnosis of PE must be accompanied by risk stratification: the risk
categories are high risk, intermediate risk (further distinguished intointermediate-low and intermediate-high risk), and low risk.
Haemodynamic instability, defined as the presence of cardiac ar-
rest, obstructive shock, or persistent hypotension, identifies high-riskpatients, which must be monitored in an intensive care unit.In patients without haemodynamic instability, further stratification
into intermediate or low-risk categories is recommended by theguidelines as a next step (I, B) based on clinical prediction rules suchas the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or its simplified ver-sion (sPESI; IIa, B). Overall, a PESI of Class I–II is a reliable predictor of
low-risk PE. Echocardiography or CTPA can identify signs of right
ventricular (RV) dysfunction the findings most frequently associatedwith unfavourable prognosis include a right ventricular/left ventriculardiameter ratio (RV/LV) > _ 1.0 and a TAPSE < 16 mm.
9,10Plasma levels
of troponin and N-terminal (NT)-proBNP are markers of myocardial
injury and RV pressure overload, respectively.11,12Patients in the
intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunctionon imaging and elevated cardiac biomarker levels are classified intothe intermediate–high-risk category. These patients should be moni-tored in an intensive care unit to permit the early detection of
haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, so that appropriate
measures can be taken promptly (I, B). Conversely, patients with nosigns of RV dysfunction and/or normal cardiac biomarker levels be-long to the intermediate–low-risk category; these patients do not re-quire monitoring in an intensive care unit but should be hospitalized.
Selected patients with low-risk PE should be considered for early
discharge and home anticoagulant treatment. Purely clinical assess-ment tools, such as the PESI, evaluate PE-related complications or
comorbidities. Tools such as the Hestia exclusion criteria also include
the patient’s expected compliance, family, and social environment, aswell as the local coordination between primary and secondary care.The recommendation of home treatment for selected patientsremains unchanged from the 2014 ESC guidelines, but its grade was
increased on account of the results of the international investigator-
initiated Home Treatment of patients with acute PE (HoT-PE) phaseIV trial
13and of a meta-analysis of observational studies showing that
in low-risk patients with acute PE classified based on clinical scoresalone, the absence of RV dysfunction on admission on top of otherclinical criteria was associated with a negligible rate of early PE-
related complications and death
14. In line with this principle, the
guidelines specify that assessment of RV function should be includedin the risk stratification of all patients with acute PE if early dischargeis considered.
During ICU stay, rescue thrombolytic therapy was
not necessary. After transferral to the cardiologyward, she was switched to the non-vitamin K-de-
pendent oral anticoagulant (NOAC) apixaban at a
dosage of 10 mg twice daily, based on her bodyweight of 75 kg and an estimated glomerular filtra-tion rate of 69 mL/min. A compression ultrasoundof the lower limb excluded DVT.
The 2019 ESC guidelines confirm previous recommendations to
reserve systemic thrombolytic therapy to high-risk patients (I, B).Surgical pulmonary embolectomy (I, C) or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment (IIa, C) are recommended if thrombolysis is con-traindicated or has failed. In intermediate-risk patients, the clinical
benefit of systemic thrombolysis is absent due to the substantial
bleeding rate of this treatment strategy.
15Therefore, guidelines dis-
courage routine use for these patients (III, B).2019 PE Guidelines and an exemplary case 3
.............................................................................................................................................................................In all patients, anticoagulation therapy should be started. The opti-
mal anticoagulant in the early stages depends on the risk group.
Immediate start of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended in
high-risk patients (I, B) because its anticoagulant effect can be easilymonitored and rapidly reversed by protamine.
16Notably, in the
PEITHO study LMWH or fondaparinux were administered before
randomization in 30.1% of patients.15
In all other patients, physicians can choose primarily oral anticoa-
gulation using one of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
(NOAC) apixaban or rivaroxaban with an increased initial dose of
apixaban for 7 days17or rivaroxaban for 21 days.18If physicians
choose initial parenteral anticoagulation, LMWH or fondaparinux are
recommended over UFH for patients without severe renal impair-
ment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < _ 30 mL/min] or severe obesity (I,
A). When initiating oral anticoagulation, the 2019 ESC Guidelinesnow recommend that a NOAC be preferred to a vitamin K antagon-
ist (VKA) (I, A). The grade of this recommendation is higher than in
the 2014 ESC guidelines where the choice of a NOAC over a VKA
was graded I, B.
2
The patient was discharged with no residual dys-
pnoea after 8 days of hospital stay with the follow-ing instruction: continue apixaban 5 mg twice daily;perform routine control of blood cell count, renaland liver function; clinical and echocardiographic as-sessment after 3 months. In occasion of the lattervisit, the patient complained of persisting and pro-gressively worsening exertional dyspnoea ( New York
Heart Association – NYHA functional class II–III) .
She denied any episode of bleeding during the threemonths of anticoagulant treatment. The echocardio-gram revealed normalized morphology and functionof the right heart.
The index event was attributed to leg injury
(without fracture) with reduced mobility, a minortransient risk factor. Tolerance and compliance totreatment were excellent. No bleeding risk factorwas identified. During the control visit, the patientsaid she was afraid of recurrence.
The physicians decided to continue with apixaban
5m gt w i c ed a i l yf o rt h r e ef u r t h e rm o n t h sa n dt h e n
reduce the dose to 2.5 mg twice daily for long-term
secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism.They noted in the patient’s chart that this decisionwas taken in light of a non-negligible risk of throm-bosis recurrence, as the index PE was associatedwith a minor transient risk factor; a low estimatedrisk of bleeding under anticoagulation; and thepatient’s preference. A control visit was planned at 6months from the index event.
Therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 months is recommended
in all patients with PE (1 A), with routine clinical evaluation at
3–6 months after the acute PE episode (I, B).The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment after three
months should be based on patient’s preference and a careful evalu-ation of the individual concurring risks of recurrence of venous
thromboembolism (VTE), which is related to the features of the
index PE and bleeding under anticoagulation.
Discontinuation of therapeutic oral anticoagulation after three
months is recommended in patients with first PE secondary to amajor transient/reversible risk factor (I, B).
Oral anticoagulant treatment of indefinite duration is recom-
mended for patients presenting with recurrent VTE (I, B) and anti-
phospholipid antibody syndrome (I, B). Patients with this kind of
persistent risk factors are considered to be at high risk of recurrence(>8% per year).
19,20
In all other patients, the risk of VTE recurrence is neither so low
nor so high as to permit a one-size-fits-all recommendation concern-
ing extended anticoagulation. The guidelines specify that indefinite
anticoagulation should be considered in these patients. This impliesthat, regardless of the final decision, the underlying rationale should
be well documented. In the first instance, this provision applies to
patients with a first PE associated with minor transient or reversiblerisk factors (IIa, C).
19,20The same recommendation regards patients
with a persistent risk factor (IIa, C) and those without identifiable risk
factors (IIa, A).
The recommendation to consider indefinite anticoagulation in all
patients is based on the superior safety profile of NOACs comparedwith VKA that was shown in extension trials.
21If extended oral anti-
coagulation is chosen, a reduced dose of the NOACs apixaban
(2.5 mg twice daily)22or rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily)23should be
considered after 6 months of therapeutic anticoagulation (IIa, A).
Oral anticoagulant treatment with a VKA for an indefinite period is
recommended for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
(I, B); cancer-associated VTE is a specific situation discussed in a sep-
arate chapter in the guidelines.
In patients who receive extended anticoagulation, the 2019 ESC
guidelines recommend reassessment of drug tolerance and adherence,hepatic and renal function, and bleeding risk at regular intervals (I, C).
After 6 months from the index event exertional
dyspnoea persisted, and no bleeding had occurred.NT-proBNP was within the normal limits and noother laboratories abnormalities were found.Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) showedreduced maximal aerobic capacity (peak oxygenconsumption) and the 6-minute-walk distancewas significantly reduced.
A V/Q ventilation/perfusion (lung scintigraphy)
scan failed to demonstrate any mismatched perfu-sion defects. Physicians ordered a CT of the chestwith both vascular and parenchymal evaluation,which showed a complete recanalization of the pul-monary circle, mild pulmonary emphysema andbronchial disease. Finally, Pulmonary Function Tests(PFTs) revealed a chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD) stage GOLD II. Tiotropium bromidewas prescribed with clinical benefit.4 A. Gallo et al.
.............................................................................................................................................................................The specifications of the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the long-term
management of PE reflect an understanding of PE as a chronic disease.Persisting dyspnoea may be one of the signs of chronic conditions dir-
ectly related to the underlying thrombo-embolic disorder. Chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a life-threatening condition being diagnosed in approximately 3% of PE sur-vivors,
24is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and
defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than
25 mmHg with a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of less than15 mmHg, documented at right heart catheterization in a patient withmismatched perfusion defects on V/Q lung scan.
25Post-PE impair-
ment (PPEI) is an umbrella definition encompassing echocardiograph-
ic abnormalities pointing to the presence of pulmonary hypertensioncombined with a cardiopulmonary symptomatology.
26Chronic
thromboembolic disease (CTED) should be considered in symptom-
atic patients with documented post-thrombotic obstructions butnormal pulmonary haemodynamic parameters at rest and withoutany other cause of their marked exercise limitation.
27
Accordingly, further diagnostic evaluation should be considered in
patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnoea/exercise limitation
after PE (IIa, C). In symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion
defects persisting on V/Q scan beyond 3 months after acute PE, refer-ral to a PH/CTEPH expert centre is recommended, after taking intoaccount the results of echocardiography, natriuretic peptide levels,
and/or CPET (I, C).
