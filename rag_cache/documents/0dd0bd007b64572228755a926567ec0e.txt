Recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis
of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in adults and children with
malignant diseases: an expert TLS panel consensus
It is essential to identify patients at risk of tumour lysis
syndrome (TLS) because this life-threatening condition may
occur rapidly and is preventable. However, standardized
procedures for assessing risk have been lacking until now.
The new, comprehensive TLS risk classiﬁcation system
reported here for adults and children accounts for all
malignancies and known risk factors, integrating them into a
simple and easy to use clinical tool that provides a basis for
recent TLS management guidelines as well as future TLS
studies.
TLS is a group of metabolic abnormalities that result from
the rapid release of intracellular metabolites such as nucleic
acids, proteins, phosphorus and potassium from lysed
malignant cells. This process can potentially cause hyperuri-
caemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, with or without
hypocalcaemia and uraemia that can lead to renal failure,arrhythmias, seizures and even death. TLS symptoms can
occur spontaneously or within 12–72 h after initiation of
cytoreductive chemotherapy and require prompt recognition
followed by aggressive management. Complications resulting
from TLS, can compromise the efﬁcacy or further adminis-
tration of chemotherapy (Levine, 2002; Yim et al, 2003; Hsu
et al, 2004) and have an impact on morbidity and mortality.
They are also associated with longer and more costly hospital
stays (Annemans et al, 2003; Candrilli et al, 2008).
TLS is most frequently associated with non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL), particularly Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia,
as well as other haematological malignancies, such as acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
(ALL), after initiation of cytotoxic treatment (Annemans et al,
2003; Akoz et al, 2007; Coifﬁer et al, 2008; Hochberg & Cairo,

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening oncological emergency
characterized by metabolic abnormalities including hyperuricaemia,
hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. These metabolic
complications predispose the cancer patient to clinical toxicities including
renal insufﬁciency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, neurological complications
and potentially sudden death. With the increased availability of newer
therapeutic targeted agents, such as rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase),
there are no published guidelines on the risk classiﬁcation of TLS for
individual patients at risk of developing this syndrome. We convened an
international TLS expert consensus panel to develop guidelines for a medical
decision tree to assign low, intermediate and high risk to patients with
cancer at risk for TLS. Risk factors included biological evidence of
laboratory TLS (LTLS), proliferation, bulk and stage of malignant tumour
and renal impairment and/or involvement at the time of TLS diagnosis. An
international TLS consensus expert panel of paediatric and adult oncologists,
experts in TLS pathophysiology and experts in TLS prophylaxis and
management, developed a ﬁnal model of low, intermediate and high risk
TLS classiﬁcation and associated TLS prophylaxis recommendations.

2009). In an observational study of patients with AML
(Montesinos et al, 2008), TLS was observed in 130 (17%)
out of 772 patients and was considered the major cause ofdeath in 2% of patients. An overall TLS incidence of 4 Æ4% was
reported in two multicentre studies of 1791 children andadolescents with NHL (Wossmann et al, 2003) and, of these,
TLS occurred in 8 Æ4% (66 out of 790) of patients with Burkitt
lymphoma/leukaemia or B-cell ALL (B-ALL). TLS may also
occur in other tumour types, especially tumours sensitive to
cytotoxic treatment, that have a high proliferative rate or havea large tumuor size or burden (Coifﬁer et al, 2008). Unex-
pected cases of TLS where a high TLS risk was not immediatelyevident and for which appropriate risk assessment andmanagement could make the difference between life and deathhave also been reported (Kalemkerian et al, 1997; Vaisban
et al, 2001; Francescone et al, 2009; Lin et al, 2009). For
example, an adult patient with end-stage renal disease and
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) developed acute TLSafter receiving low dose COP chemotherapy (cyclophospha-mide, vincristine and dexamethasone) and allopurinol (Linet al, 2009). A computed tomography scan revealed a retro-
peritoneal mass (8 Æ5·9Æ5c m
2) while laboratory values on
presentation included a creatinine level of 566 lmol/l and a
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 523 u/l. In another case,
an adult patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
and pre-existing asotemia developed acute TLS and renalfailure after initiation of high-dose corticosteroid therapy(Vaisban et al, 2001). Both of these cases highlight that overall
TLS risk derives from the collective contribution of severalindividual risk factors and underline the critical need for a riskmodel that integrates them in order to identify high TLS risk,even in unusual settings. Risk factors for TLS include age, type
of malignancy, tumour burden (stage/LDH), white blood cell
(WBC) counts and whether renal function is compromised(Michallet et al, 2005; Coifﬁer et al, 2008). Some risk strati-
ﬁcation systems have been developed by regional entities, buteach system addresses different diseases, uses different criteriaand establishes different thresholds for risk (Seidemann et al,
1998; Wossmann et al, 2003; Bertrand et al, 2008; Coifﬁer
et al, 2008; Montesinos et al, 2008; Tosi et al, 2008). TLS risk
guidelines (Bertrand et al, 2008) developed by the French
Society for the Prevention of Cancer in Children andAdolescents (SCFE) only addressed T-cell lymphoma, B-celllymphoma, ALL and AML and did not assess TLS risk in adultpatients. Similarly, the TLS risk stratiﬁcation system developedby the Berlin–Frankfurt–Mu ¨nster (BFM) Group is restricted to
children (Seidemann et al, 1998; Wossmann et al, 2003) and
focuses only on B-NHL and T-LBL, while recent guidelines
proposed by an international panel of experts (Coifﬁer et al,
2008) do not address all malignancies or uniformly assess riskbased on renal involvement/function. Consequently, none ofthese guidelines can be uniformly applied to all patients at riskof developing TLS. The need for a straightforward andunifying risk stratiﬁcation model is particularly importantfor TLS because it is encountered almost exclusively byphysicians with a haematology/oncology, nephrology and/or
emergency room background.
Methods
To address this unmet need an international panel of experts(Appendix I) met in Paris in November 2008 to reach aconsensus concerning a comprehensive TLS risk classiﬁcationsystem based on the peer-reviewed literature, standards ofpractice and clinical experience. The panel was chosen for their
expertise in adult and paediatric malignancies as well as TLS
pathophysiology and management. A review of the literaturefor the last 43 (1966–2009) years on the incidence, prophylaxisand treatment of TLS was conducted by the TLS expert panel.Both an evidenced-based literature and expert opinion-basedapproach was utilized (Tables I and II).
A preliminary version of the proposed TLS risk evaluation
model was produced in advance of this meeting by a steering
committee. Low-risk disease (LRD) was deﬁned as an approx-
imate risk of less than 1% of developing TLS, intermediate riskdisease (IRD) was deﬁned as a risk of approximately 1–5% ofdeveloping TLS and high risk disease (HRD) was deﬁned as arisk of greater than 5% (>5%) of developing TLS based on theincidence deﬁned in the literature (Annemans et al, 2003;
Wossmann et al, 2003; Akoz et al, 2007; Coifﬁer et al, 2008;
Konuma et al, 2008; Montesinos et al, 2008; Chen & Chuang,
2009; Choi et al, 2009). Each proposed recommendation was
discussed at length by the entire expert panel during themeeting and required consensual agreement by all panelmembers before being included in the ﬁnal model.
The diverse specialties of the panel ensured that the risk
stratiﬁcation model reﬂected best clinical practice andaddressed the issues and concerns relevant to each specialty.Furthermore, this risk model complements and builds upon
recent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of
paediatric and adult TLS proposed by Coifﬁer et al (2008).
Results
TLS risk classiﬁcation model
TLS risk evaluation was based on three sequential phases,
which collectively deﬁned the ﬁnal evaluation of TLS risk.Firstly, patients were assessed for the presence of laboratoryTLS (LTLS) (Hande & Garrow, 1993; Cairo & Bishop, 2004).Patients were required to have two or more abnormalities ofuric acid (increased), potassium (increased), or phosphate(increased) in order to be deﬁned as LTLS (Cairo & Bishop,2004). Next, haematological malignancies and solid tumours
were classiﬁed as LRD, IRD or HRD. Patients were also
stratiﬁed by age and stage, bulk disease, WBC count and LDHlevel. The third step required an adjustment to be made basedon renal function and renal involvement, and patients wouldthen be ﬁnally classiﬁed as having a high risk, intermediate riskor low risk of developing TLS.TLS Risk Classiﬁcation in Adults/Children with Malignancies

Biological signs of TLS
In the present model LTLS was diagnosed by one of three
clinical scenarios. Serum uric acid levels were within normallimits but serum phosphate and potassium levels exceeded the
upper limit of normal. LTLS was also diagnosed when uric acid
levels were above the upper limit of normal and concurrentlyeither phosphate or potassium levels were above the upperlimit of normal. An elevated uric acid, potassium andphosphate has previously been determined to be ‡476lmol/l
or‡25% increase from baseline, ‡6Æ0 mmol/l or ‡25% increase
from baseline and ‡2Æ1 mmol/l or ‡25% increase from
baseline, respectively (Cairo & Bishop, 2004). During the time
period where patients are at risk of developing LTLS,
electrolyte and chemistry monitoring should be conducted atleast every 6 h or earlier, depending on the clinical conditionof the patient. Calcium levels were not included as a criterionfor establishing LTLS in this risk classiﬁcation system because
hypocalcaemia may not be considered a direct consequence ofTLS and is associated with high phosphate levels in the vastmajority of cases (Navolanic et al, 2003). This TLS risk
classiﬁcation model should not be used for patients withpre-existing elevated uric acid levels due to gout prior to thediagnosis of their malignancy.
Risk assessment based on malignant disease type
Most solid tumours were classiﬁed as LRD (Fig 1). However,bulky solid tumours that were sensitive to chemotherapy, suchas neuroblastoma, germ-cell tumours and small-cell lungcancers, were classiﬁed as IRD. In general, most solid tumourswere at very low risk of developing TLS (LRD) (Drakos et al,
1994; Kalemkerian et al, 1997; Baeksgaard & Sorensen, 2003;
Vaisban et al, 2003; Tosi et al, 2008). Myelomas were also
classiﬁed as LRD (Fig 1).
The panel subdivided leukaemias into two categories:
chronic and acute leukaemias. Chronic myeloid leukaemia(CML) was an LRD (Fig 1) in the present risk classiﬁcationsystem. To take into account the therapy-dependent risk forTLS in patients with CLL (Cheson et al, 1998; Dillman &
Hendrix, 2003; Hussain et al, 2003; Hummel et al, 2005;
Calvo-Villas et al, 2008; Lin, 2008; Phelps et al, 2009), CLL was
an LRD when treated exclusively with alkylating agents, but an
IRD in the presence of an elevated WBC ( ‡50·10
9/l) and/or
were treated with targeted and/or biological therapies (ﬂudar-abine/rituximab).
Acute leukaemias were divided into three categories: AML,
ALL and Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia (B-ALL) (Fig 2). Therisk of TLS was assessed in each of these categories, based onWBC counts and LDH levels, as both factors correlated withTLS risk (Navolanic et al, 2003; Truong et al, 2007; Monte-
sinos et al, 2008). This is the ﬁrst risk classiﬁcation system that
takes into account all of these variables for all types ofleukaemia. AML was either an LRD, IRD or HRD, dependingon WBC counts and LDH levels. Similarly ALL was an IRD orHRD depending on WBC counts and LDH levels (Fig 2).B-ALL was always considered an HRD.
The panel classiﬁed Hodgkin, small lymphocytic, follicular,
marginal zone B-cell, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue,
mantle cell (non-blastoid variants) and cutaneous T-cell
lymphomas as LRDs (Fig 3A). The panel decided to classifyearly-stage Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia and lymphoblasticlymphomas as IRD, except when LDH levels were twice ormore above the upper limit of normal, in which case they wereHRD. Advanced-stage Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia and lym-phoblastic lymphomas were always considered as HRD.
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was an LRD in
children with stage I and II disease and an IRD in children with
stage III or stage IV disease. ALCL was an LRD in adults,irrespective of disease staging (Fig 3B). Adult T-cell (ATL),DLBCL, peripheral T-cell, transformed and mantle cell(blastoid variants) lymphomas were classiﬁed as either LRD,Table I. Levels of evidence.

IRD or HRD, depending on patient age, LDH levels, disease
staging and tumour bulk (Fig 3B). Finally, myelomas were
classiﬁed as LRD (Fig 1).
Adjustment of TLS risk based on renal function
and/or involvement
Several renal conditions may predispose patients to developing
TLS, such as pre-existing uraemia or hyperuricaemia,decreased urinary ﬂow or acidic urine, dehydration, oliguria,anuria and renal insufﬁciency or renal failure (DeConti &Calabresi, 1966; Arseneau et al, 1975; Landgrebe et al, 1975;
Tsokos et al, 1981; Kunkel et al, 2000; Annemans et al, 2003;Bosly et al, 2003; Cairo & Bishop, 2004). Apart from renal
failure, kidney(s) involvement at diagnosis represents a rare
but signiﬁcant risk factor (Stapleton et al, 1988; Locatelli &
Rossi, 2005).
In the proposed classiﬁcation system, this ﬁnal level aggre-
gated all individual risk factors described above, plus renal riskfactors, for the ﬁnal classiﬁcation of patients. This is the ﬁrstTLS risk classiﬁcation system that combines multiple factorsinto a ﬁnal assessment of the patient’s risk of developing TLSrather than restricting analysis to individual parameters.
Consequently, patients with lymphomas or leukaemias consid-
ered to be LRDs, were classiﬁed as being at an intermediate riskof developing TLS if there was renal dysfunction and/or renal
Fig 1. TLS risk assessment of solid tumours, myelomas and chronic leukaemias. Most solid tumours are low-risk diseases (LRD). Bulky, solid
tumours that are sensitive to chemotherapy are intermediate-risk diseases (IRD). Myelomas are LRD. Risk classiﬁcation of chronic leukaemia varies
according to type of leukaemia and treatment strategy.

involvement (Fig 4A). Similarly, patients with leukaemias and
lymphomas considered to be IRDs were classiﬁed as being at ahigh-risk of developing TLS if there was renal dysfunction and/or renal involvement (Fig 4B). Patients with IRDs and normalrenal function would also be high-risk for TLS if their uric acidlevels and either phosphate or potassium levels were higherthan the upper limit of normal (Fig 4B).
Discussion
The above TLS risk stratiﬁcation and classiﬁcation developedby the TLS expert risk panel is a medical decision tree thatincorporates histological diagnosis, extent and bulk of disease(stage, LDH, bulk), use of speciﬁc cytotoxic agents, age atdiagnosis and pre-existing renal dysfunction or renal involve-ment as major risk factors in this model. The level of evidence(Table I) is based on Harbour and Miller (2001). The risk ofdeveloping TLS for patients with LRD was estimated to be
<1% with a level of evidence ranging from 2+ to 4 (Table I).
The risk of developing TLS for patients with IRD wasestimated to be 1–5% with a level of evidence of 1+ to 2+
(Table I). The risk for patients with HRD of developing TLS
was estimated to be >5% with a level of evidence of 1++ to 1+
(Table I) (modiﬁed Harbour & Miller, 2001).
The prophylaxis recommendations were a modiﬁcation of
the previous review by Coifﬁer et al (2008). The grade of
recommendations (Table II) was based on Harbour and Miller(2001). The TLS prophylaxis recommendation based on TLSrisk is summarized in Table III. In general, patients with a lowrisk (LRD) of developing TLS should be monitored for
development of TLS and complications; normal hydration
and no prophylaxis for hyperuricaemia should be given exceptin cases of signs of metabolic changes, bulky and/or advan-ced disease and/or high proliferative disease, in which case

allopurinol should be added (Table III). This grade of recom-
mendation is a level B (Table II). Patients with an intermediaterisk (IRD) of developing TLS should be monitored for TLS andcomplications, administered increased hydration (3l/m
2per d)
and administered allopurinol (100–300 mg, po, q8h, daily)without the need for alkalinization (Table III). This grade ofrecommendation is a level B (Table II). In patients with highrisk (HRD) of developing TLS, frequent monitoring should be
performed, increased hydration (3l/m
2per d), unless evidence of
renal insufﬁciency and oliguria, and rasburicase (0 Æ1–0Æ2 mg/kg)
for one dose and repeated only if clinically necessary. Inpatients with a prior history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-genase, rasburicase is contraindicated and allopurinol shouldbe utilized instead of rasburicase (Table III). This grade ofrecommendation is a level A (Table II). Furthermore, man-agement of hyperkalemia and/or hyperphosphataemia should
be managed as per institutional routine and/or based on
previous TLS treatment guidelines (Cairo & Bishop, 2004;Coifﬁer et al, 2008). Lastly, patients who develop LTLS whowere originally classiﬁed as either LRD or IRD, should receive
rasburicase unless clinically contraindicated.
Returning to the two case reports discussed above, in the
dialysis patient with DLBCL (Lin et al, 2009) the risk
classiﬁcation of this patient would be moved from inter-mediate to high risk of TLS according to this new riskclassiﬁcation system due to increased LDH levels, renaldysfunction and the presence of bulky disease, while the CLL
patient (Vaisban et al, 2001) would be elevated from low risk
to intermediate risk of TLS due to the presence of pre-existingasotemia. These two examples demonstrate the broad appli-cability of this new risk classiﬁcation model and its ability toidentify TLS risk even in unusual settings, such as DLBCL,where it is not immediately considered. Importantly, physi-cians must consider that TLS risk derives from the collectivecontribution of individual risk factors and is not exclusively
associated with a particular malignancy.
This risk classiﬁcation model, developed by a panel of TLS
experts, integrates diverse criteria into a user-friendly, simple
