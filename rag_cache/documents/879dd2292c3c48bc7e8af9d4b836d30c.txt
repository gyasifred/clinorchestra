 GOLD 2024 REPORT HIGHLIGHTS  
The GOLD report is revised annually and has been used worldwide by healthcare professionals as a tool to implement 
effective management programs based on local healthcare systems.  
In the 2024 revision of the GOLD report several important change s have been made as follows:  
i. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 have been consolidated  into one chapter to reduce repetitive information  
ii. Some tables have been consolidated to remove repetition; all table and figure numbers have been changed to 
consecutive figure numbers only.  
iii. PubMed links (where available) have now been included in the reference list and all references can now be found 
at the end of the GOLD report (rather than at the end of each chapter).  
iv. Information about PRISm (preserved ratio but impaired spirometry) has been expanded (Page 13)  
v. A new section on Hyperinflation has been added (Page 17) 
vi. In the Spirometry section further clarification about pre -bronchodilator spirometry has been added (Page 26) 
vii. A new section on Screening for COPD in Targeted Populations (Page 29) has been added with information on 
Leveraging Lung Cancer Imaging for COPD screening (Page 29), including spirometry screening in targeted 
populations, and Leveraging Incidental Lung Imaging Abnormalities for COPD Screening  (Page 30) 
viii. In the Initial Assessment section, the paragraphs on Blood Eosinophil Count have been updated (Page 34) 
ix. Interstitial Lung Abnormalities  are now covered (Page 38) 
x. The section on Smoking Cessation has been revised (Page 43) 
xi. Vaccination Recommendations for people with COPD have been updated in line with current guidance from the 
US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  (Page 46) 
xii. Managing Inhaled Therapy  has been expanded (Page 53) and includes information on a patient’s Ability to use 
the Delivery System Correctly (Page 54) and Choice of Inhaler Device  (Page 54) 
xiii. A new section on Pharmacotherapies for Smoking Cessation has been added (Page 68) 
 
GOLD has been fortunate to have a network of international distinguished health professionals from multiple disciplines. 
Many of these experts have initiated investigations into the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries and have 
developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of the GOLD management strategy. The 
GOLD initiative will continue to work with National Leaders and other interested healthcare professionals to bring COPD to 
the attention of governments, public health officials, healthcare workers, and the general public , to raise awareness of the 
burden of COPD and to develop programs for early detection, prevention and approaches to ma nagement.

 GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, MANAGEMENT 
AND PREVENTION OF COPD 2024 UPDATE1 
METHODOLOGY  
When the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive  Lung Disease (GOLD) program was initiated in 1998, a goal was to 
produce recommendations for  management of COPD based on the best scientific information available. The first 
report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of COPD was issued in 2001. In 2006 and again 
in 2011 a complete revision was prepared based on published research.  These reports, and their companion 
documents, have been widely distributed and translated into many languages and can be found on the GOLD website 
(www.goldcopd.org).  
 
The GOLD Science Committee2 was established in 2002 to review published research on COPD  management and 
prevention, to evaluate the impact of this research on recommendations in the GOLD documents related to 
management and prevention, and to post yearly updates on the GOLD website. Its members are recognized leaders in 
COPD research and clinic al practice with the scientific credentials to contribute  to the task of the Committee and are 
invited to serve in a voluntary  capacity. 
 
This 2024 GOLD Report is an update of the 2023 -revised report. The 2023 GOLD Report was the 5th major revision of 
GOLD, and incorporated a reassessment and revision of recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment and 
treatment of COPD. Updates of the 2017 -revised report were made in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Updates of 
the 2011-revised report were released in January 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.   
 
Process: To produce the GOLD report, a PubMed search (National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National 
Library of Medicine, Bethesda MD, USA) was  completed using search fields established by the Committee: 1) COPD or 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( All Fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-analysis (All Fields) OR 3) articles in 
the top 20 medical or respiratory journals  (available on request)  or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews .  
 
Publications in peer review ed journals not captured by the PubMed searches may be submitted to the Chair, GOLD 
Science Committee, providing the full paper , including abstract, is submitted in (or translated into)  English.  
 
Members of the Committee receive a summary of citations and all abstracts.  Each abstract is assigned to two 
Committee members, although all members are offered the opportunity to provide input on any abstract. Members 
evaluate the abstract or, subject to her/his judgment, the full publication, by answering four specific written questions 
from a short questionnaire, to indicate if the scientific data presented impacts on recommendations in the GOLD 
report. If so, the member is asked to specifically identify modifications that should be made.  
 
The GOLD Science Committee meets twice yearly to discuss each publication that was considered by at least one 
member of the Committee to potentially have an impact on the management of COPD. The full Committee then 
reaches a consensus on whether  to include it in the report, either as a reference supporting current recommendations, 
or to change the report. In the absence of consensus, disagreements are decided by an open vote of the full 
Committee. Only high-quality systematic reviews and meta -analyses that provide strong evidence for changing clinical 
 1 The Global Strategy for Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of COPD (updated 2024), the Pocket Guide (updated 2024) and the complete list of references 
examined by the Committee is available on the GOLD website: www.goldcopd.org.

 practice are cited in the GOLD report with preference given to citing the original randomized controlled trial(s).  
 
Recommendations by the GOLD Committees for use of any medication are based on the best evidence available from 
the published literature and not on labeling directives from government regulators. The Committee does not make 
recommendations for therapies tha t have not been approved by at least one major regulatory agency. 
 
NEW REFERENCES   
The GOLD 2024 report is an update GOLD 2023 report which was a major revision. Following systematic literature 
searches and double -blind review by the GOLD Science Committee, the GOLD report has been updated to include key 
peer-reviewed research publications from January 2022 to July 2023. In total, 148 new references have been added 
to the GOLD 2024 report.

 GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, MANAGEMENT, 
AND PREVENTION OF COPD  
INTRODUCTION  
The aim of the GOLD Report is to provide a non -biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis 
and treatment of people with COPD. One of the strengths of GOLD reports is the treatment objectives. These have  
stood the test of time, and are organized into two groups: objectives that are directed towards relieving and reducing 
the impact of symptoms, and objectives that reduce the risk of adverse health events that may affect the patient at 
some point in the future  (exacerbations are an exa mple of such events ). This emphasizes the need for clinicians to 
focus on both the short -term and long-term impact of COPD on    their patients. 
 
A second strength of the original strategy was the simple, intuitive system for classifying COPD severity. This was based 
on FEV1 and was called a staging system because it was believed, at the time, that the majority of patients followed a 
path of disease progression in which the severity of COPD tracked the severity of airflow obstruction. Much is now 
known about the characteristics of patients in the different GOLD stages – for example, their risk of exacerbations, 
hospitalization, and death. However, at  an individual patient level, FEV1 is an unreliable marker of the severity of 
breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment , and risk of exacerbation . 
 
At the time of the original report, improvement in both symptoms and health status was a GOLD treatment objective, 
but symptoms assessment did not have a direct relation to the choice of management, and health status measurement 
was a complex process large ly confined to clinical studies. Now, there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed 
for use in routine daily clinical practice. These are available in many languages. These developments have enabled an 
assessment system to be developed that draws t ogether a measure of the impact of the patient’s symptoms and an 
assessment of the patient’s risk of having a serious adverse health event . This management approach can be used in 
any clinical setting anywhere in the world and moves COPD treatment towards individualized medicine – matching the 
patient’s therapy more closely to his or her needs.  
 
BACKGROUND   
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  is now one of the top three causes of death worldwide  and 90% of 
these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).(1,2) More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012  
accounting for 6% of all deaths globally. COPD represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable 
and treatable. COPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world; many people suffer 
from this disease for  years and die prematurely from it or its complications. Globally, the COPD burden is projected to 
increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the  population.(3) 
 
In 1998, with the cooperation of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health  and the 
World Health Organization the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was implemented. Its 
goals were to increase awareness of the burden of COPD and to improve prevention and management of COPD 
through a concerted worldwide effort of peopl e involved in all facets of healthcare and healthcare policy. An important 
and related goal was to encourage greater research interest in this highly prevalent disease.  
 
In 2001, GOLD released its first report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD . This 
report was not intended to be a comprehensive textbook on COPD, but rather to summarize the current state of the

 field. It was developed by individuals with expertise in COPD research and patient care and was based on the best -
validated concepts of COPD pathogenesis at that time, along with available evidence on the most appropriate 
management and prevention strategi es. It provided state-of-the-art information about COPD for pulmonary specialists 
and other interested physicians and served as a source document for the production of various communications for 
other audiences, including an Executive Summary, a Pocket Gui de for Healthcare Professionals, and a Patient Guide.  
 
Immediately following the release of the first GOLD report in 2001, the GOLD Board of Directors appointed a Science 
Committee, charged with keeping the GOLD documents up  to date by reviewing published research, evaluating the 
impact of this research on the management recommendations in the GOLD documents, and posting yearly updates of 
these documents on the GOLD website.  
 
In 2018 GOLD held a one-day summit to consider information about the epidemiology, clinical features, approaches 
to prevention and control , and the availability of resources for COPD in LMICs. (1) Major conclusions of the summit 
included that: there are limited data about the epidemiological and clinical features of COPD in LMICs but the data 
available indicate there are important differences in these features around the world; there is widespread availability 
of affordable tobacco products as well as other exposures (e.g. , household air pollution) thought to increase the risk 
of developing COPD; diagnostic spirometry services are not widely available and there are major problems with access 
to affordable quality -assured pharmacological and non -pharmacological therapies. GOLD is therefore concerned that 
COPD is not being taken seriously enough at any level , from individuals and communities, to national governments 
and international agencies. (4) It is time for this to change and the GOLD Board of Directors challenge all relevant 
stakeholders to work together in co alition with GOLD to address the avoidable burden of COPD worldwide. GOLD is 
committed to improving the health of people at risk of and with COPD , wherever they happen to have been born , and 
wishes to do its bit to help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.4  to reduce premature 
mortality from non-communicable diseases - including COPD - by one third by 2030 .(5)

CHAPTER 1: DEFINITION  AND OVERVIEW  
KEY POINTS:  
Definition 
• Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by 
chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough,  sputum production and/or exacerbations) due to 
abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause 
persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.  
Causes and Risk Factors 
• COPD results from gene (G)-environment(E) interactions occurring over the lifetime(T) of the 
individual (GETomics) that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging 
processes.  
• The main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of 
toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental  and 
host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging)  can also contribute. 
• The most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in  the 
SERPINA1 gene that lead to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A number of other genetic variants have also 
been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small . 
Diagnostic Criteria 
• In the appropriate clinical context (see ‘Definition’ & ‘Causes and Risk Factors’ above), the presence 
of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction (i.e., FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post-bronchodilation) measured by 
spirometry confirms the diagnosis of COPD.  
• Some individuals can have respiratory symptoms and/or structural lung lesions (e.g., emphysema) 
and/or physiological abnormalities ( including low FEV1, gas trapping,  hyperinflation, reduced lung 
diffusing capacity and/or rapid FEV1 decline) without airflow obstruction ( FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post-
bronchodilation). These subjects are labeled ‘Pre -COPD’. The term ‘PRISm’ (Preserved Ratio 
Impaired Spirometry) has been proposed to identify those with normal ratio but abnormal 
spirometry. Subjects with Pre-COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over 
time, but not all of them do . 
Clinical Presentation 
• Patients with COPD typically complain of dyspnea, activity limitation and/or cough with or without 
sputum production and may experience acute respiratory events characterized by increased 
respiratory symptoms called exacerbations  that require specific preventive and therapeutic 
measures. 
• Patients with COPD frequently harbor other comorbid diseases that influence their clinical 
condition and prognosis and require specific treatment  as well. These comorbid conditions can 
mimic and/or aggravate an acute exacerbation.  
New Opportunities 
• COPD is a common, preventable, and treatable disease, but extensive under-diagnosis and 
misdiagnosis leads to patients receiving no treatment or incorrect treatment.  Appropriate and 
earlier diagnosis of COPD can have a very significant public -health impact. 
• The realization that environmental factors other than tobacco smoking can contribute to COPD, 
that it can start early in life and affect young individuals, and that there are precursor conditions 
(Pre-COPD, PRISm), opens new windows of opportunity for its prevention, early diagnosis, and 
prompt and appropriat e therapeutic intervention.

 WHAT IS COPD?  
Definition 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory 
symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production and/or exacerbations ) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, 
bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction. (6)  
Causes and risk factors  
COPD results from gene(G) -environment(E) interactions occurring over the lifetime(T) of the individual (GETomics) 
that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes. (7)  
 
The main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and 
gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental(8,9) and host factors (including abnormal lung 
development and accelerated lung aging)  can also contribute.(7)   
 
The most relevant (albeit  epidemiologically rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the 
SERPINA1 gene, leading to α1 -antitrypsin deficiency, but other genetic variants , with a low individual effect size,  are 
associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD  too.(10)  
Diagnostic criteria  
In the appropriate clinical context ( See ‘Definition’ and ‘Causes and Risk Factors’ above), the presence of non -fully 
reversible airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post-bronchodilation) measured by spirometry confirms the diagnosis 
of COPD.  
 
Yet, some individuals may present with  structural lung lesions (e.g., emphysema) and/or physiological abnormalities 
(including low FEV1, gas trapping, hyperinflation, reduced lung diffusing capacity and/or rapid FEV1 decline) without 
airflow obstruction ( FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post-bronchodilation). These subjects are labeled ‘Pre-COPD’. The term ‘PRISm’ 
(Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry) has been proposed to identify those with normal ratio but abnormal 
spirometry. Subjects with Pre-COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over time , but not all of 
them do.(11,12) Research is needed to determine what is the best treatment for these individuals (beyond smoking 
cessation). 
Clinical presentation  
Patients with COPD typically complain of dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, fatigue , activity limitation, and/or cough 
with or without sputum production, and may experience acute events characterized by increased respiratory 
symptoms called exacerbations that influence their health status and prognosis, and require specific preventive and 
therapeutic measures.  
 
Patients with COPD frequently harbor other comorbid diseases that also influence their clinical condition and 
prognosis and require specific treatment as well. These comorbid conditions can mimic and/or aggravate an acute 
exacerbation. 
New opportunities

receiving no treatment or incorrect treatment. The realization that environmental factors other than tobacco smoking

 can contribute to COPD, that it can start early in life and affect young individuals, and that there are precursor 
conditions (Pre-COPD, PRISm), opens new windows of opportunity for its prevention, early diagnosis, and prompt and 
appropriate therapeutic in tervention.(13) 
 
BURDEN OF COPD   
COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an economic and social burden that is both 
substantial and increasing. (14,15) COPD prevalence, morbidity and mortality vary across countries. (16,17) The prevalence 
of COPD is often directly related to the prevalence of tobacco smoking, but in many countries outdoor, occupational 
and household air pollution (resulting from the burning of wood and other biomass fuels) are important COPD risk 
factors.(18,19)  
 
The prevalence and burden of COPD are projected to increase over the coming decades due to a combination of 
continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the world’s population. (3) Information on the burden of COPD 
can be found on international websites, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) (20) and the World Bank/WHO 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study.(21,22) 
Prevalence 
Existing COPD prevalence data var y widely due to differences in survey methods, diagnostic criteria, and analytical 
approaches.(3) Of note, all of these epidemiologic studies defined COPD by spirometry alone. The lowest estimates of 
prevalence are those based on self -reporting of a doctor’s diagnosis of COPD, or equivalent condition. For example, 
most national data show that < 6% of the adult population have been told that they have COPD. (23) This is likely to be 
a reflection of the widespread under -recognition and under -diagnosis of COPD.(24)  
 
Data are emerging that enable more accurate estimates of COPD prevalence. A number of systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses provide evidence that the prevalence of COPD is appreciably higher in smokers and ex -smokers 
compared to non-smokers, in those ≥ 40 years of age compared to those < 40, and in men compared to women. (25-27) 
The Latin American Project for the Investigation of Obstructive Lung Disease (PLATINO) (28) examined the prevalence of 
post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction among persons ≥ 40 years in one major city from each of five Latin American 
countries – Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The prevalence of COPD increased steeply with age, with 
the highest prevalence among those > 60 years. Prevalence in the total population ranged from 7.8% in Mexico City  
to 19.7% in Montevideo, Uruguay. The  prevalence was appreciably higher in men than in women, (28) which contrasts 
with findings from European cities such as Salzburg, Austria. (29) Analyses of the GBD database suggests an overall 
increase in COPD prevalence in females while it has decreased in males and in some countries in the European Union 
between 2001 and 2019. (30) The Burden of Obstructive Lung Diseases (BOLD) program used standardized methodology 
comprising questionnaires and pre - and post-bronchodilator spirometry to assess prevalence and risk s for COPD 
globally in people aged ≥ 40 years.(29,31,32) BOLD reported an overall prevalence of COPD of  11.8% (standard error (SE) 
7.9) for men and 8.5% (SE 5.8) for women (33) and a substantial prevalence of COPD of 3 %-11% among never-smokers.(33) 
BOLD examined the prevalence of COPD in north and sub -Saharan Africa and Saudi Arabia and found similar results. (34-
37) Based on BOLD and other large scale epidemiological studies, it is estimated that the global prevalence of  COPD is 
10.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2% ,12.8%).(25,38) With the increasing prevalence of smoking in LMICs, and aging 
populations in high-income countries, the prevalence of COPD is expected to rise.(39) 
Morbidity 
Morbidity measures traditionally include physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. To date 
studies indicate that morbidity due to COPD increases with age ,(23,24,28) and in patients with COPD the development of 
comorbidities are seen at an earlier age. (40,41) Morbidity in COPD may also be influenced by concomitant chronic

 conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal impairment, diabetes mellitus) (42) that are related to smoking, 
aging and/or COPD.(43)  
Mortality 
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes mortality statistics for selected causes of death annually for all WHO 
regions.(44) However, data must be interpreted with caution because of the inconsistent use of COPD terminology. In 
the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10), deaths 
from COPD or chronic airways obstruction are included in the broad category of “COPD and allied conditions” (ICD -10 
codes J42-46). 
 
Under-recognition and under -diagnosis of COPD reduces the accuracy of mortality data. (45,46) Furthermore, the 
accuracy of COPD diagnosis codes recorded in administrative health databases is also uncertain. (47,48) In some 
jurisdictions, reliance on administrative health data, particularly those that only record hospitalizations, may 
underestimate the burden of COPD. (49) The reliability of recording of COPD -related deaths in mortality data is also 
problematic. Although COPD is often a primary cause of death, it is more likely to be listed as a contributory cause of 
death or omitted from the death certificate entirely. (50) However, it is clear that COPD is one of the most important 
causes of death in most countries. For instance, in 2011, COPD was the third leading cause of death in the United 
States.(51) This increase in COPD -related mortality has mainly been driven by the expanding epidemic of smoking; 
reduced mortality from other common causes of death (e.g., ischemic heart disease, infectious diseases); the aging of 
the world’s population, particularly  in high-income countries; and scarcity of effective disease modifying therapies. 
Data from the GBD Study 2017 estimated a COPD -attributable death rate was 42/100,000 (4.72% of all -cause 
deaths)(3,52) 
 
With these caveats in mind, it can be estimated that globally there are around three million deaths annually  due to 
COPD.(53) It is estimated that the increased prevalence of smoking in LMICs coupled with aging populations in high -
income countries will result in over 5.4 million annual deaths from COPD and related conditions by 2060. (54,55) 
Economic burden  
COPD is associated with significant economic burden. In the European Union, the total direct costs of respiratory 
disease are estimated to be about 6% of the total annual health care budget, with COPD accounting for 56% (38.6 
billion Euros) of the cost of respiratory disease. (56) In the United States the costs attributable to COPD are expected to 
increase over the next 20 years, with projected costs of $800.90 billion or $40 billion per year .(57,58) Dynamic modeling 
also predicts that women are expected to incur higher direct costs than men and lose more quality-adjusted life 
years.(58) COPD exacerbations account for the greatest proportion of the total COPD burden on the health care 
system.(59) Not surprisingly, there is a striking direct relationship between the severity of COPD and the cost of care, 
and the cost distribution changes as the disease progresses. For example, hospitalization and ambulatory oxygen costs 
soar as COPD severity increa ses. Any estimate of direct medical expenditure for home -based care under-represents 
the true cost of home -based care to society because it ignores the economic value of the care provided by family 
members to people with COPD.  
 
In LMICs both direct and indirect medical costs may be substantial. Recent work from the WHO and other organizations 
suggest that inhaled medicines for COPD are poorly available and largely unaffordable in LMICs. (60) Most inhaled 
medications are still branded and there a re few options currently available for generic inhalers.  The situation is similar 
for access to diagnostic spirometry. Because the healthcare sector might not provide long -term supportive care 
services for severely disabled individuals, COPD may force at least two individuals to leave the workplace  – the affected 
individual and a family member who must now stay home to care for their disabled relative. (61) Since human capital is 
often the most important national asset for LMICs, the indirect costs of COPD may represent a  serious threat to the ir 
economy.

 Social burden 
Since mortality offers only a limited perspective on the human burden of a disease, it is desirable to find other 
measures of disease burden that are consistent and measurable within and between nations. The GBD study designed 
a method to estimate the fraction of mortality and disability attributable to major diseases and injuries using a 
composite measure of the burden of each health problem: the Disability -Adjusted Life Years (DALY).(62) The DALY for a 
specific condition are the sum of years lost because of premature mortality and years of life lived with disability, 
adjusted for the severity of disability. The GBD Study found that from 1990 to 2019, COPD was the primary driver of 
increased DALY worldwide, especially in LMIC s.(21,63) The global health burden caused by COPD increasing by 25.7% 
from 59.2 million DALY in 1990 to 74.4 DALY in 2019 with largest increases in South East Asia, India, Sub -Saharan Africa 
and South America.(64) In 2005 COPD was the eighth leading cause of DALY lost across the world but by 2013 COPD 
was ranked as the fifth leading cause of DALY lost. (52,65) In the United States, COPD is the second leading cause of 
reduced DALY, trailing only ischemic heart disease. (66) Data from GBD 2017 estimated that the DALY rate was 
1068.02/100,000 for COPD. (52) 
 
PATHOGENESIS  
COPD is the end-result of complex, cumulative and dynamic gene-environment interactions over the lifetime that can 
damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development al or aging processes.(7) Understanding the relationships and 
interactions between the genetic (G) background of the host and varied environmental (E) risk factors over the lifetime 
(T) requires further investigation.  The term GETomics has been recently proposed to illustrate the complex and 
dynamic series of interactions between Genetics and Environment over Time. (7) According to this GETomics proposal, 
the end result of a given GxE interaction depends not only on G and E, but also on T, as determined by both the age of 
the individual at which that particular interaction occurs (development vs aging) and the previous h istory of GxE 
interactions that the individual has encountered earlier in her/his life (biological memory) .(7) 
Environmental risk factors  
Cigarette smoking  
Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD. Cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of 
respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV1, and a greater COPD 
mortality rate than non -smokers.(67) Yet fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPD (68) and it is estimated that 
half of all COPD cases worldwide are due to risk factors other than tobacco so other pathogenic factors b eyond 
smoking need to be considered. (9)  
 
Genetics modify the risk of COPD in smokers, but there may also be other risk factors involved. For example, gender 
and social pressure may influence whether a person takes up smoking or experiences certain occupational or 
environmental exposures; socioeconomic status may be linked to birthweight ( which may impact lung growth and 
development, and in turn susceptibility to developing COPD);(69) and longer life expectancy will allow greater lifetime 
exposure to risk factors.  
 
Other types of tobacco (e.g., pipe, cigar, water pipe) (70-72) and marijuana(73) are also risk factors for COPD. Passive 
exposure to cigarette smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)  and second-hand smoking, may also 
contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD ,(74) especially after long -term exposure.(75) Smoking during pregnancy 
poses a risk for the fetus, by altering lung growth and development in utero, and possibly priming the immune system  
by inducing specific epigenetic changes .(76) This is a good example of the GETomics approach discussed above . The 
fetus exposed to ‘passive smoking’ is likely to respond differently to a second GxE hit later in life. (7)

 Biomass exposure  
Tobacco smoking has been recognized as a major risk factor associated with COPD for over five decades, but this was 
largely because most research was conducted in high income countries. As more studies from LMICs were 
conducted,(19) it became apparent that non -smoking risk factors were more important in these parts of the world. 
Whilst tobacco smoking remains the leading risk factor for COPD in high income countries, accounting for over 70% of 
the cases, in LMICs tobacco smoking cont ributes to around 30% to 40% of the total burden. (9) Because the LMICs 
together contribute to over 85% of the total burden of COPD globally, non -smoking risk factors now contribute to over 
50% of the global burden of COPD. (9) 
 
Wood, animal dung, crop residues, and coal, typically burned in open fires or poorly functioning stoves, may lead to 
very high levels of household air pollution.(77) Household air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk of 
developing COPD in LMICs (78) although the extent to which household air pollution versus other poverty -related 
exposures explain the association is unclear. (79-82) Almost three billion people worldwide use biomass and coal as their 
main source of energy for cooking, heating, and other household needs, so the population at risk worldwide is very 
large.(83,84) There is limited research about household air pollution related COPD or the interventions that could reduce 
the risk of developing it. (85)  
 
Many of the environmental exposures in LMICs are currently unregulated and , in combination with poverty and poor 
nutrition, amplify the risk of airway and lung parenchymal damage. Advocacy efforts to minimize exposure to risk 
factors must continue, based on robust evidence from epidemiological, translational, clinical and implementation 
research.(9) There are no randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) that have addressed the appropriate pharmacotherapy 
of non-smoking COPD. There is therefore an urgent need to conduct robust RCTs to better understand the most 
effective treatment that can be offered to non-smoking COPD. Phenotypic differences between smoking and non -
smoking COPD have been reported in only a few studies. In brief, compared to COPD in smokers, non -smoking COPD 
is more common in females, in younger age groups, exhibits similar (or milder) respiratory sympto ms and quality of 
life, a lesser rate of decline in lung function over time, lower neutrophils and a trend towards higher eosinophil 
numbers in the airway sputum , similar spirometric indices, greater small airways obstruction (respiratory oscillometry 
and radiology), less emphysema and a similar defect in macrophage phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. (86-88) 
Potential molecular mechanisms for non -smoking COPD include inflammation, oxidative stress, airway remodeling and 
lung aging.(9) However, there are still several knowledge gaps that exist. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps, 
as COPD related to biomass exposure, tobacco smoking or various other causes (see below) might exhibit different 
clinical features and trajectories , and benefit from different approaches to both pharmacological and non -
pharmacological treatments. (9) 
 
Occupational exposures  
Occupational exposures, including organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents and fumes, are an under -appreciated 
environmental risk factor for COPD. (18,89) Individuals with exposure to inhalation of high doses of pesticides have a 
higher incidence of respiratory symptoms, airways obstruction and COPD. (90,91) A study of the population -based UK 
biobank cohort identified occupations including sculptors, gardeners and warehouse workers that were associated 
with an increased COPD risk among never -smokers without asthma. (92) A cross-sectional observational study 
demonstrated that self -reported exposure to workplace dust and fumes is associated with not only increased airflow 
obstruction and respiratory symptoms, but also more emphysema and gas trapping, as assessed by computed 
tomography scan, in both men and women. (93) An analysis of the large U.S. population -based National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey III survey of almost 10,000 adults aged 30 -75 years estimated the fraction of COPD 
attributable to workplace exposures was 19.2% overall, and 31.1% among never -smokers.(94) These estimates are 
consistent with a statement published by the American Thoracic Society that concluded that occupational exposures 
account for 10-20% of either symptoms or functional impairment consistent with COPD. (95) The risk from occupational 
exposures in less regulated areas of the world is likely to be much higher than reported in studies from Europe and

 North America. 
 
Air pollution 
Air pollution typically consists of particulate matter (PM), ozone, oxides of nitrogen or sulfur, heavy metals, and other 
greenhouse gases, is a major worldwide cause of COPD, responsible for approximately 50% of the attributable risk for 
COPD in low and middle income countries (LMICs). (96) In never smokers, air pollution is the leading known risk factor 
for COPD.(97) The respiratory risk of air pollution to individuals is dose -dependent with no apparent “safe” thresholds. 
Even in countries with low ambient air pollution levels, chronic exposure to PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxides significantly 
impairs lung growth in childr en,(98) accelerates lung function decline in adults and increases the risk for COPD, 
especially among those with additional risk factors for COPD. (99) Poor air quality from air pollution also increases the 
risk of COPD exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality .(100,101) Thus, reduction in both indoor and outdoor air 
pollution is a key goal in the prevention and management of COPD.  
Genetic factors 
A significant familial risk of airflow obstruction has been observed in people who smoke and are siblings of patients 
with severe COPD,(102) suggesting that genetics (in combination with environmental risk factors) could influence this 
susceptibility. The best documented genetic risk factor for COPD are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene that leads to the 
hereditary deficiency of α-1 antitrypsin (AATD),(103) a major circulating inhibitor of serine proteases. Although AATD 
deficiency is relevant to only a small part of the world’s population, it illustrates the interaction between genes and 
environmental exposures that predispose an individual to COPD.  A systematic review of 20 studies in European 
populations found AATD PiZZ genotypes in 0.12% of COPD patients (range 0.08 -0.24%), and a prevalence ranging from 
1 in 408 in Northern Europe to 1 in 1,274 in Eastern Europe .(104) 
 
There has been a long -standing controversy concerning the risk of heterozygotes (MZ and SZ) for the development of 
COPD. This has largely reflected acquisition bias but is of critical importance due to the large numbers of such 
individuals worldwide (105) who may potentially benefit from augmentation therapy. Recent careful sibling 
studies(106,107) indicated no increased risk in these heterozygotes in the absence of smoking although lung function was 
reduced in smokers compared to MM siblings. This likely reflects the presence of low concentrations of the Z AAT 
protein rather than an absolute lack of it (108) and is not an indication for augmentation therapy  (discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 3). 
 
To date, hundreds of genetic variants associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD  have been identified , 
including genes encoding matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP -12), glutathione S-transferase, the alpha -nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor, and the hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) .(109,110) Yet, their individual effect size is small (10) 
and it remains uncertain whether these genes are directly responsible for COPD or are merely markers of other causal 
genes.(111-115) 
Trajectories of lung function: development and aging  
At birth, the lung is not fully developed. It grows and mature s until about 20-25 years of age (earlier in females), when 
lung function reaches its peak ( Figure 1.1).(67) This is followed by a not very well defined but relatively short plateau 
and a final phase of mild lung function decline due to physiological lung aging. This constitutes the normal lung function 
trajectories labeled TR1 in Figure 1.1.(116) This normal lung function trajectory can be altered by processes occurring 
during gestation, birth, childhood , and adolescence that affect lung growth (hence, peak lung function) and/or 
processes shortening the plateau phase and/or accelerating the aging phase (hence accelerating the normal rate of 
lung function decline with age). (117)

Spirometrically measured reduced maximal attained lung function can identify individuals who are at increased risk 
for the development of COPD. (16,118) A large study and meta -analysis confirmed a positive association between 
birthweight and FEV1 in adulthood.(119) Factors in early life termed “childhood disadvantage factors” are key 
determinants of lung function in adult life. (119-126) One study in three independent longitudinal cohorts (Framingham, 
Copenhagen and Lovelace) found that approximately 50% of patients developed COPD due to accelerated decline in 
FEV1 over time (the traditional Fletcher and Peto model) ,(127) while the other 50% developed COPD due to abnormal 
lung growth and development (with normal lung function decline over time; Figure 1.1).(116)  
 
Age is often listed as a risk factor for COPD  because there is a physiologic decline in lung function with age . Yet, it is 
unclear if healthy aging as such leads to COPD or if age reflects the sum of cumulative exposures throughout life. (128) 
However, aging of the airways and parenchyma mimic some of the structural changes associated with COPD (128) and 
there is evidence of accelerated aging in patients with COPD. (121) A prospective study showed an association between

 accelerated telomere shortening (a marker of accelerated aging) and progressive worsening of pulmonary gas 
exchange, lung hyperinflation and extrapulmonary affection in COPD patients followed over 10 years. (129) Further, 
persistently shorter telomeres over this observation time increase the risk for all -cause mortality.(129) Age-related 
epigenetic changes in DNA in immune cells are also associated with increased risk of exacerbations and mortality in 
COPD patients.(130,131) In the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the mixed (low FVC and low FEV1/FVC ratio) and 
the obstructive-only (low FEV1/FVC ratio) spirometric patterns showed the highest prevalence of COPD at age 53 (37% 
and 22% respectively). (125) 
 
The term dysanapsis refers to an anthropometric mismatch of airway tree calibre relative to lung volume. (132,133) It was 
first proposed by Green and colleagues almost fifty years ago from maximal expiratory airflow variation among healthy 
adults.(120) There are still major gaps in our understanding of the origins and clinical implications of dysanapsis, but 
recent research using computed tomography (CT) has shown that: (1) it is common in the general 
population;(120,124,134)(2) it is associated with FEV1/FVC from early adulthood ;(135) (3) in explanted lungs from adult 
healthy donors, central airway dysanapsis (detectable by CT) extended to peripheral airways (non -visible on CT);(135) 
(4) dysanapsis is associated with baseline airflow obstruction and risk of incident COPD independently of age, sex, 
height and race-ethnicity, but not with lung function decline over time. (124) This observation is consistent with the 
trajectory of low peak lung function in early adulthood followed by normal lung function decline that accounts for 50% 
of COPD in older adults ;(116) (5) a computational study of airway tree fluid dynamics and an in vivo study of regional 
lung ventilation suggest that dysanapsis may contribute to obstructive lung disease pathophysiology and deposition 
of aerosolized drugs ;(136-138) and, (6) the mechanisms contributing to the development of dysanapsis are not well 
understood. It is not clear whether it is due to genetic predisposition, in utero exposures to noxious particulates or 
pathogens, premature birth, low birth weight, neonatal lung injury, repeated respiratory infections in early life or a 
combination of them, but factors affecting airway tree growth early in life (120,122,124) and factors affecting airway tree 
homeostasis later in life have been implicated. (121,123) Of note, investigating the aetiology of dysanapsis earlier in life 
will require radiation -free (or lower dose radiation) methods in order to quantify lung structure in children.  
 
The fact that COPD can result from reduced peak lung function in early adulthood and/or accelerated lung function 
decline later in life(117,139) opens novel opportunities for prevention , and earlier diagnosis and treatment  of the 
disease(13) but, at the same time, has generated several nosological terms that require proper definition to avoid 
confusion and facilitate future research: (140) 
 
Early COPD 
The word “early” means “near the beginning of a process”. Because COPD can start early in life and take a long time 
to manifest clinically, identifying “early” COPD is difficult. Further, a biological “early” related to the initial mechanisms 
that eventually lead to COPD should be differentiated from a clinical “early ”, which reflects the initial perception of 
symptoms, functional limitation and/or structural abnormalities noted. Thus, we propose to use the term “early COPD” 
only to discuss the “biological” first steps of the disease in an experimental setting .  
 
Mild COPD 
Some studies have used “mild” airflow obstruction as a surrogate for “early” disease. (141) This assumption is incorrect 
because not all patients started their journey from a normal peak lung function in early adulthood, so some of them 
may never suffer “mild” disease in terms of “severity” of airflow obstruction.(117) Further, “mild” disease can occur at 
any age and may progress or not over time. (139) Accordingly, we propose that “mild” should not be used to identify 
“early” COPD and used only to describe the severity of airflow obstruction measured spirometrically .  
 
Young COPD 
The term “young COPD” is seemingly straightforward because it directly relates to the chronological age of the patient. 
Given that lung function peaks at around 20 -25 years,(67) we propose to operationally consider “ young COPD” in 
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   13 
 patients aged 20–50 years.(142) Of note, this can include patients who had never achieved normal peak lung function 
in early adulthood and/or those with shorter plateau and/or early lung function decline. (143,144) Young COPD may be 
associated with significant structural and functional lung abnormalities (i.e., young COPD is not necessarily 
synonymous with “mild” COPD) that can have a substantial impact on health and , importantly, is frequently not 
diagnosed and thus not treated. A family history of respiratory diseases and/or early -life events (including 
hospitalizations before the age of 5 years) is reported by a significant proportion of young patients with COPD, further 
supporting the possibility of early -life origins of COPD.(140,144) 
 
Pre-COPD 
This term has been recently proposed to identify individuals (importantly, of any age) who have respiratory symptoms 
and/or other detectable structural and/or functional abnormalities, in the absence of airflow obstruction on forced 
spirometry. These patients may (or not) develop persistent airflow obstruction (i.e., COPD) over time .(145) A recent 
publication highlights the need for  RCTs, both in patients with ‘Pre-COPD’, and in young people with COPD.(146) 
 
PRISm 
The term PRISm (preserved ratio impaired spirometry ) describes individuals with preserved ratio (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 after 
bronchodilation) but impaired spirometry (FEV1 < 80% of reference, after bronchodilation). (12,147) The prevalence of 
PRISm in population -based studies ranges from 7.1% to 11% (148-151) and from 10.4% to 11.3% in a selected population 
of current and former smokers such as the COPDGene cohort. (152) The prevalence of PRISm is particularly high in 
current and former smokers, and it is associated with both high and low body mass index (BMI) values, female gender, 
obesity  and multimorbidity. (148-151) PRISm is associated with increased risk of : cardiopulmonary disease ; all-cause  and 
cardiovascular mortality; hospitalization; and an increased risk of developing airways obstruction .(148,149,151,153-155)  
 
PRISm is not always a stable phenotype and can transition to both normal and obstructed spirometry over time. It has 
been reported that around 20% to 30% of PRISm subjects transitioned to obstructed spirometry over time and the 
most important predictors of  transition from PRISm spirometry to COPD are lower baseline FEV1%, and FEV1/FVC, 
higher age, current smoking, female gender, and a longer FET in the second assessment. (149,151,152) Despite an increasing 
body of literature on PRISm, significant knowledge gaps remain in relation to its pathogenesis and treatment.  
 
Not all individuals with pre -COPD or PRISm will eventually develop fixed airflow obstruction over time (and hence 
COPD) but they should be considered “patients” (because they already suffer symptoms and/or have functional and/or 
structural abnormalities) a nd, as such, they deserve care and treatment. The challenge is that there is no evidence on 
what the best treatment is for these patients yet. (156)  
Asthma and airway hyper -reactivity 
Asthma may also be a risk factor for the development of chronic airflow obstruction and COPD. In a report from a 
longitudinal cohort of the Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease, adults diagnosed of asthma 
were found to have a 12 -fold higher risk of acquiring COPD over time compared to those without asthma, after 
adjusting for smoking. (157) Another longitudinal study of people with asthma found that around 20% developed 
irreversible airflow obstruction and reduced diffusing lung capacity .(158) A third longitudinal study observed that self -
reported asthma was associated with excess loss of FEV1 in the general population. (159) A study examining the pattern 
of lung-growth decline in children with asthma found that 11% met lung function impairment consistent with the 
spirometric classification of COPD in early adulthood. (160) In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, 
airway hyper-responsiveness was second only to cigarette smoking as the leading risk factor for COPD, responsible for 
15% of the population attributable risk (smoking had a population attributable risk of 39%).(161) The pathology of 
chronic airflow obstruction in asthmatic non-smokers and non-asthmatic smokers is markedly different, suggesting 
that the two disease entities may remain different even when presenting with similarly reduced lung 
function.(157,162,163) However, separating asthma from COPD in adults may be clinically difficult at times. Further,

 abnormal lung development in childhood and adolescence can cause asthma -like symptoms. Given that poor lung 
development is associated with COPD in adulthood ( Figure 1.1), these infants and adolescents may have been 
mislabeled as asthma.  
 
On the other hand, a irway hyper-responsiveness can exist without a clinical diagnosis of asthma and has been shown 
to be an independent predictor of COPD and respiratory mortality in population studies (164,165) as well as an indicator 
of risk of excess decline in lung function in patients with mild COPD. (166) 
Chronic bronchitis  
Chronic bronchitis (CB) is a common, but variable condition in patients with COPD. CB is defined by the presence of 
cough with expectorated sputum on a regular basis over a defined period. Variability in the prevalence of CB depends 
upon the definition used which differs in the regularity or duration of CB symptom s.(167) The classic description defines 
CB as chronic cough and sputum production for at least 3 months per year for two consecutive years , in the absence 
of other conditions that can explain these symptoms (an important caveat that is often ignored) . Using this definition, 
the prevalence of CB ranges from 27 -35% in large observational studies in patients with COPD. (168-170) Other factors 
associated with increased prevalence of CB in COPD includes male sex, younger age, greater pack -years of smoking, 
more severe airflow obstruction, rural location and increased occupational exposures. (167-173) Although the primary risk 
for CB is smoking, 4 -22% of CB is found in never smokers suggesting other factors are involved. (174,175) Inhalational 
exposures to dusts, biomass fuels, chemical fumes or domestic heating and cooking fuels may be important. (172,173,176) 
Gastroesophageal reflux is also associated with an increased incidence of CB. (177,178) 
 
Normal airway mucus is a gel comprised of 97% water and 3% solids (mucins, non -mucin proteins, cellular debris, salts 
and lipids ) that traps inhaled toxins which are subsequentially expectorated via the processes of ciliary beating and 
cough.(179) Mucins are large glycoproteins,  two of the secreted mucin polymers, MUC5AC and MUC5B, line the human 
airways.(180,181) In healthy normal individuals, MUC5AC is produced by proximal airway surface goblet cells while 
MUC5B is produced by surface secretory cells found throughout the airways and submucosal glands. (180-184) In COPD, 
MUC5B levels markedly increase due to submucosal gland hyperplasia and airway occlusion can occur. (185-187) Viruses, 
acrolein and many cytokines (IL -4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-25) can also increase MUC5AC production. (188-193) 
 
Lung health depends upon effective mucus clearance . In disease states, thick and viscoid mucus can lead to airway 
inflammation and infection. Cough and dyspnea are the principal symptoms of impaired mucous clearance. (194,195) 
Cough and sputum production are predominately associated with mucus production in the large airways. However, 
increased mucus production also occurs in the smaller conducting airways and is associated with luminal occlusion , 
hallmarked by dyspnea but less cough and sputum production. (196,197) Radiographic manifestations of mucous plugging 
may be present and persist in patients with COPD despite a lack of CB symptoms and is associated with greater airflow 
obstruction, lower oxygen saturation and worsened quality of life (198,199) and all-cause mortality.(200) A high index of 
suspicion for mucus hypersecretion should be maintained in all patients with COPD due to the protean clinical 
problems that accompanies its presence. (201)  How patients who have mucus hypersecretion evident on CT but do not 
manifest symptoms differ phenotypically and vice versa is not fully understood.  
 
The relationship between chronic mucus production and lung function, exacerbations and mortality has been the 
subject of multiple investigations. In young adults without a history of asthma and normal lung function, the presence 
of chronic cough with sputu m identified a subgroup at high risk of developing COPD independently of smoking 
habits.(202) In adults less than 50 years of age, CB without airflow obstruction represents an early marker for 
susceptibility to the long -term risk of COPD and all -cause mortality.(203) In smokers between 36 to 43 years of age with 
chronic mucus production, there was a significant higher risk of airflow obstruction, however, following smoking 
cessation, mucus production returned to levels observed amongst never smokers. (204) Importantly, the longer chronic 
mucus hypersecretion is present, the greater the concurrent decrease in FEV1.  While both MUC5AC and MUC5B have

 been associated with CB symptoms, among current smokers, it is sputum MUC5AC that has been associated more 
specifically with increased exacerbation frequency, increased symptoms and greater lung function decline. (205,206)  
Large epidemiologic studies have shown after adjustment for height, age and smoking history, men with cough or 
phlegm and women with cough show accelerated loss of lung function. (207) Other studies have suggested an association 
between chronic sputum production and lower lung function, or greater FEV1 decline in patients with COPD. (207-211)  
 
The association of chronic mucus hypersecretion and mortality is unclear. Several studies report no predictive value 
of mucus production on mortality when controlling for respiratory impairment and smoking ;(212-214) other studies state 
sputum production has an independent role in predicting both overall and COPD -specific mortality.(171,215-217)  In the 
Copenhagen city heart study, chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with pulmonary infection that was 
implicated in 54% of the deaths. (218) Moreover, chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with excessive FEV1 
decline and increased COPD hospitalizations. (210)  In patients with advanced emphysema, chronic bronchitis has been 
associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality. (219) In patients with non -obstructive chronic bronchitis, 
increased all-cause and respiratory disease related mortality has been reported. (220,221) 
Infections 
A history of severe childhood respiratory infection s has been associated with reduced lung function and increased 
respiratory symptoms in adulthood. (161) The Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development 
documented a synergistic interaction between smoking and infant respiratory infections as well as early life home 
overcrowding with lung function at age 43. (222)  Chronic bronchial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 
has been associated with accelerated FEV1 decline. (223) Tuberculosis (TB) is a risk factor for COPD  (23 studies; pooled 
odds ratio 2.59 (95% CI 2.12,3.15) ; pooled prevalence of COPD in patients with prior pulmonary TB was 21% (95% CI: 
16–25%)).(224,225) Tuberculosis is both a differential diagnosis for  COPD and a potential comorbidity. (226,227) Finally, HIV 
patients are at increased risk of COPD compared to HIV negative controls (11 studies; pooled odds ratio for 1.14 (95% 
CI 1.05,1.25))(228,229) probably due to methylation disruptions in airway epithelium. (230) IgG subclass deficiency  has also 
been observed in hospitalized patients with COPD and this was associated with a significantly increased risk of 
mortality.(231) 
Sex 
Sex related differences in immune pathways and pattern of airway damage might be clinically important  although 
more work in this area is needed.  In the past, most studies have reported that COPD prevalence and mortality are 
greater among men than women, but later data from developed countries has shown that the prevalence of COPD is 
almost equal in males and females, probably reflecting the changing patterns of tobacco smoking. (232) Although 
controversial, some studies have suggested that women may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoking 
than men,(26,233-235) leading to more severe disease for the equivalent quantity of cigarettes consumed. (236) This notion 
has been validated in animal studies and human pathology specimens, which have demonstrated a greater burden of 
small airway disease in females compared with males with COPD despite a similar history of tobacco smoke 
exposure.(237,238) A systematic review and meta -analysis of the global prevalence of COPD reported sex-based 
prevalence differences  across WHO Global Burden of Disease sub -regions. In females the highest prevalence of COPD 
was observed in North America (8.07% vs 7.30%) and in urban settings (13.03% vs 8.34%). Using the World Bank’s 
income categories prevalence was highest in upper -middle income countries for males (9.00%) and in high -income 
countries for females.   
Race and ethnicity 
An ATS workshop report (239) has recommended replacing race - and ethnicity-specific equations with race -neutral 
average reference equations in pulmonary function testing.  It also emphasized the importance of further research 
and education into the clinical and epidemiological consequences of these changes. (239)

 Socioeconomic status  
Poverty is consistently associated with airflow obstruction(240) and lower socioeconomic status is associated with an 
increased risk of developing COPD .(241,242) It is not clear, however, whether this pattern reflects exposures to household 
and outdoor air pollutants, crowding, poor nutrition, infections, or other factors relat ed to low socioeconomic status.  
 
PATHOBIOLOGY 
In patients with COPD pathological changes can be found in the airways, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary 
vasculature.(243) These include inflammatory and structural changes which increase with the severity of airflow 
obstruction and can persist on smoking cessation ( Figure 1.1).   
Inflammatory changes 
The inflammation observed in the lungs of COPD patients appears to be a modification of the normal inflammatory 
response to chronic irritants such as cigarette smoke. The mechanisms for this amplified inflammation are not yet fully 
understood but may, at least in part, be genetically determined.  
 
COPD is characterized by increased numbers of macrophages in peripheral airways, lung parenchyma and pulmonary 
vessels, together with increased activated neutrophils and increased lymphocytes. These inflammatory cells, together 
with epithelial cells and ot her structural cells release multiple inflammatory mediators (244) which attract inflammatory 
cells from the circulation (chemotactic factors), amplify the inflammatory process (via proinflammatory cytokines), 
and induce structural changes (via growth factors). (245) Lung inflammation can persist after smoking cessation through 
as yet unclear mechanisms, although autoantigens and perturbations in the lung microbiome may play a role. (246,247)  
Systemic inflammation may also be present and could play a role in the comorbid conditions frequently found in 
patients with COPD. (244) The nature of the inflammatory response in non-smoking related COPD is much less well 
characterized.  
 
Although both COPD and asthma are associated with chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, there are 
differences in the inflammatory cells and mediators involved in the two diseases. (248) albeit some patients with COPD 
have an inflammatory pattern with increased eosinophils and ILC2 cells , similar to that of asthma .(249)  
 
Oxidative stress can also contribute to COPD. (244,250) Biomarkers of oxidative stress (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, 8 -
isoprostane) are increased in the exhaled breath condensate, sputum, and systemic circulation of COPD patients. 
Oxidative stress is further increased during exacerbations. Oxidants are both genera ted by cigarette smoke and other 
inhaled particulates and released from activated inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. (226,251) 
Structural changes  
There is compelling evidence for an imbalance in the lungs of COPD patients between proteases derived from 
inflammatory and epithelial cells that break down connective tissue components and antiproteases that 
counterbalance this action. (252)  Protease-mediated destruction of elastin, a major connective tissue component of the 
lung parenchyma, is an important feature of emphysema but its role may be more difficult to establish in airway 
changes.(253)

 Peribronchiolar fibrosis and interstitial opacities have been reported in patients with COPD and in  asymptomatic 
smokers.(246,254-256) An excessive production of growth factors may be found in smokers and patients with COPD. (257) 
Inflammation may precede the development of fibrosis or repeated injury of the airway wall itself may lead to 
excessive production of muscle and fibrous tissue. (258) This may be a contributing factor to the development of small 
airways obstruction. (259) 
 
The lung vasculature can also be altered in patients with COPD, even those with mild disease. (260) 
 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
Airflow obstruction and gas trapping  
Airflow obstruction is usually measured by spirometry as this is the most widely available and reproducible test of lung 
function. In COPD, airflow obstruction is caused by a mixture of small airways disease  (which increases airway 
resistance) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema , that reduces the normal elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma ), 
the relative contributions of which vary from person to person. Further, these changes do not always occur together 
and may evolve at different rates over time. Chr onic inflammation causes structural changes, narrowing of the small 
airways, luminal exudates in the small airways and destruction of the lung parenchyma that leads to the loss of alveolar 
attachments to the small airways and decreases lung elastic recoil.  In turn, these changes diminish the ability of the 
airways to remain open during expiration. A loss of small airways may also contribute to airflow obstruction and 
mucociliary dysfunction .(261) The reduced number of small airways identified in patients with COPD (261) may be due to 
an enhanced loss of airways and/or to deficient lung development (see dysanapsis above; Figure 1.1).(139) Collectively, 
all these changes limit emptying of the lungs during forced expiration, decrease FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, and 
contribute to gas trapping and  lung hyperinflation.(262) 
Hyperinflation 
Hyperinflation occurs when gas volume in the lungs is increased compared to normal values at the end of spontaneous 
expiration.(263,264) Hyperinflation is clinically relevant in patients with COPD and contributes to dyspnea, (265-268)impaired 
exercise tolerance,(269-271) increased number of hospitalizations, (272) development of respiratory failure (273) and 
increased mortality. (270,272,274) In patients with COPD, hyperinflation arises due to loss of elastic recoil and expiratory 
flow obstruction.(275) Expiratory flow obstruction occurs when the expiratory flows generated during spontaneous 
breathing are the maximal flows that can be generated at that operational lung volume. (263) Expiratory flow obstruction 
is caused by the dual effects of emphysematous parenchymal destruction and airways abnormalities (e.g., mucus 
obstruction, airway edema, heightened bronchial tone, airway wall remodeling). The lung can be hyperinflated at rest 
(static hyperinflation due t o the loss of elastic lung recoil as a consequence of emphysema) and/or during exercise 
(dynamic hyperinflation as a consequence of airflow obstruction) when ventilatory demands are increased and 
expiratory times are reduced. (263,264)   
 
Hyperinflation is common in patients with COPD and can be found in patients with even mild obstruction at rest and 
even more so during exercise.(276,277) In patients with moderate to severe obstruction, the level of dynamic 
hyperinflation correlates more closely with the impairment in diffusion capacity and severity of small airways 
obstruction and higher ventilatory response to exercise than FEV1 measurem ent.(263,269)  
 
Lung volumes assessed by body plethysmography or gas dilution techniques (helium dilution or nitrogen washout) 
represent the reference measurements to assess the presence and degree of hyperinflation, however, values may vary 
due to differences in measurin g compressible gas volumes or communicating gas volumes, respectively. (278,279) 
Measurement of inspiratory capacity at rest and during exercise is an indirect measurement of increased end -

 expiratory lung volumes and indicates the presence of static and/or dynamic hyperinflation. (280) Hyperinflation can 
also be detected on chest imaging but standardization is lacking. (263) 
 
Hyperinflation can be addressed with bronchodilators, (281,282) supplemental oxygen, (283,284) heliox,(285) pulmonary  
rehabilitation,(286) pursed lip breathing, (287) inspiratory muscle training (288) or in selected cases of emphysema causing 
severe hyperinflation, lung reduction surgery (289) or bronchoscopic lung reduction techniques. (290,291) 
Pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities  
Structural abnormalities in the airways, alveoli and pulmonary circulation in patients with COPD alter the normal 
ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions. This is the main mechanism of abnormal pulmonary gas exchange resulting 
in different degrees of arterial hypoxemia, without or with hypercapnia. (292) Rarely, reduced ventilation may also be 
due to reduced ventilatory drive (e.g., sedatives and hypnotic drugs), causing hypercapnic respiratory failure and 
acidosis.(293) Parenchymal destruction due to emphysema also leads to decreased lung diffusing capacity ( DLco). In 
general, pulmonary gas exchange worsens as the disease progresses.  
Pulmonary hypertension  
In smokers with normal spirometry and in COPD patients with mild airflow obstruction there may be abnormalities in 
the pulmonary circulation that include intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia. (294-297) 
Moreover, an inflammatory response in vessels, similar to that seen in the airways, can be observed in these 
individuals along with evidence of endothelial cell dysfunction. Yet, severe pulmonary hypertension in COPD is 
rare.(298,299) It may develop late in the course of COPD and it can be due to a combination of loss of pulmonary capillary 
bed due to emphysema and/or hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries. Progressive pulmonary 
hypertension may lead to right ventricu lar hypertrophy and eventually to right -sided heart failure (‘cor pulmonale’). 
Severe pulmonary hypertension worsens survival.(300) Interestingly, the diameter of pulmonary artery as measured on 
computed tomography (CT) scans has been shown to relate to the risk of suffering exacerbations, independent of 
previous history of exacerbations. (301)  
Exacerbations 
Exacerbations of respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD can be triggered by a number of different factors (alone 
or in combination), including respiratory infections with bacteria or viruses (which may coexist), environmental 
pollutants, or unknown fac tors. During exacerbations there is evidence of increased airway and systemic inflammation, 
increased gas trapping and hyperinflation with reduced expiratory flow, thus accounting for increased dyspnea ,(302) 
and worsening of VA/Q abnormalities that can result in arterial hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia. (303) Other 
conditions, such as pneumonia, pulmonary, and/or heart failure, among others, may mimic or aggravate an 
exacerbation of COPD , and need to be considered in the clinical management of these episodes .(304) See Chapter 4 for 
an extended discussion on exacerbations.  
Multimorbidity 
Most patients with COPD suffer concomitant chronic comorbid diseases linked to the same risk factors i.e., smoking, 
aging, and inactivity, which may have a major impact on health status and survival. (305) Airflow obstruction and 
particularly hyperinflation affect cardiac function. (302) Inflammatory mediators in the circulation may contribute to 
skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia, and may initiate or worsen comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease, heart 
failure, osteoporosis, normocytic anemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome  (see Chapter 5).

 TAXONOMY  
COPD has been traditionally understood as a single “disease” caused by tobacco smoking. (127) Accordingly, most efforts 
have been devoted to the study of the pathogenetic mechanisms of only one major cause of COPD (cigarette smoking), 
failing to expand the horizon about the heterogeneity of processes that we know can contribute to its final clinical 
presentation.(7) It is therefore important to expand the taxonomy (classification) of COPD to include non -smoking 
related COPD types, so specific studies can be designed and conducted for these different types of COPD  or 
etiotypes.(306) Figure 1.2 combines two recent taxonomic proposals developed independently. (6,307) This proposal has 
relatively little impact on current clinical practice, other than illuminating this so -far ignored aspect of COPD, but it is 
of the outmost importance to highlight the need to explore current and future therapies in these other etiotypes of 
COPD.

CHAPTER 2: DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT  
 
KEY POINTS:  
• A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or 
sputum production, a history of recurrent low er respiratory tract infections and/or a history of 
exposure to risk factors for the disease , but spirometry showing the presence of a post -
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of COPD . 
• The goals of the initial COPD assessment are to determine the severity of airflow obstruction, the 
impact of disease on the patient’s health status, and the risk of future events (such as 
exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), to guide therapy.  
• Additional clinical assessment, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, 
exercise testing and/or lung imaging may be considered in COPD patients with persistent 
symptoms after initial treatment. 
• Concomitant chronic diseases (multimorbidity) occur frequently in COPD patients, including 
cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, 
depression, anxiety, and lung cancer. These comorbidities should be actively sought , and treated 
appropriately when present , because they influence health status, hospitalizations and mortality 
independently of the severity of airflow obstruction due to COPD . 
 
 
 
DIAGNOSIS  
A diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, 
and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease ( Figure 2.1) but forced spirometry that demonstrates the  
presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 is mandatory to establish the diagnosis of COPD .(45) 
 
CLINICAL PRESENTATION  
Symptoms 
Chronic dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of COPD. Cough with sputum production is present in up to 30% 
of patients. These symptoms may vary from day -to-day(308) and may precede the development of airflow obstruction 
by many years. Individuals, particularly those with COPD risk factors, presenting with these symptoms should be 
examined to search for the underlying cause(s).  Airflow obstruction may also be present without chronic dyspnea 
and/or cough and sputum production and vice versa.(309) Although COPD is defined on the basis of airflow obstruction, 
in practice the decision to seek medical help is usually determined by the impact of symptoms on a patient’s functional 
status. A person may seek medical attention either because of chronic respiratory symptoms or because of an acute, 
transient episode of exacerbated respiratory symptoms.

Dyspnea 
Dyspnea is a cardinal symptom of COPD  and a major cause of the disability and anxiety associated with the disease. (310) 
Dyspnea comprises a sensory and an affective component. (311) Typically COPD patients describe their dyspnea as a 
sense of increased effort to breathe, chest heaviness, air hunger, or gasping. (312) However, the terms used to describe 
dyspnea may vary both individually and culturally. (312)    
 
Dyspnea is highly prevalent across all stages of airflow obstruction.(313) It occurs particularly during exertion or physical 
activity. Moderate-to-severe dyspnea has been reported by > 40% of patients diagnosed with COPD in primary care. (314) 
 
Dyspnea is complex and multiple mechanisms can be involved in its pathogenesis, including impaired respiratory 
mechanics as a consequence of airflow obstruction and lung hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral 
muscle dysfunction related to deconditioning (and systemic inflammation  in some patients), psychological distress, 
dysfunctional breathing, cardiovascular or other comorbid diseases. (315,316) 
 
Dyspnea measured by the 5 -level modified Medical Research Council scale is integrated in the GOLD clinical 
classification scheme  (see below) because patients with high dyspnea scores incur higher healthcare resource 
utilization and costs.(317) Dyspnea in daily life can be measured by a number of detailed questionnaires that are more 
discriminant and sensitive to change. (318,319)

 Chronic cough  
Chronic cough is often the first symptom of COPD and is frequently discounted by the patient as an expected 
consequence of smoking and/or environmental exposures. Initially, the cough may be intermittent, but subsequently 
it may be present every day, often throughout the day. Chronic cough in COPD may be productive or non-
productive.(320) In some cases, significant airflow obstruction may develop without the presence of a cough. Other 
causes of chronic cough are listed in Figure 2.2. Syncope during cough in patients with severe COPD can occur due to 
rapid increases in intrathoracic pressure during prolonged attacks of coughing. Coughing spells may also cause rib 
fractures, which are sometimes asymptomatic.  
Sputum production  
COPD patients commonly raise small quantities of tenacious sputum with coughing. Regular production of sputum for 
three or more months in two consecutive years (in the absence of any other conditions that may explain it) is the 
classical definition of chro nic bronchitis,(321) but this is a somewhat arbitrary definition that does not reflect the entire 
range of sputum production that occurs in COPD  (see detailed discussion in Chapter 1). Sputum production is often 
difficult to evaluate because patients may swallow sputum rather than expectorate it, a habit that is subject to 
significant cultural and sex variation. Furthermore, sputum production can be intermittent with periods of flare -up 
interspersed with periods of remission. (204) Patients producing large volumes of sputum may have underlying 
bronchiectasis.(322,323) The presence of purulent sputum reflects an increase in inflammatory mediators, (324,325) and its 
development may identify the onset of a bacterial exacerbation, though the association is relatively weak. (325,326)  
 
Wheezing and chest tightness  
Inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes  and chest tightness are symptoms that may vary between days, and over the 
course of a single day. Alternatively, widespread inspiratory or expiratory wheezes can be present on auscultation. 
Chest tightness often follows exertion, is poorly localized, is muscular in character,  and may arise from isometric 
contraction of the intercostal muscles. An absence of wheezing or chest tightness does not exclude a diagnosis of 
COPD, nor does the presence of these symptoms confirm a diagnosis of asthma.

 Fatigue  
Fatigue is the subjective feeling of tiredness or exhaustion and is one of the most common and distressing symptoms 
experienced by people with COPD. (327) People with COPD describe their fatigue as a feeling of “general tiredness” or 
as a feeling of being “drained of energy”. (328,329) Fatigue impacts a patient’s  ability to perform activities of daily living 
and their quality of life. 
Additional clinical features in severe disease  
Weight loss, muscle mass loss, and anorexia are common problems in patients with severe and very severe COPD. (330-
332) They have prognostic importance (333,334) and can also be a sign of other diseases, such as tuberculosis or lung cancer, 
and therefore should always be investigated. Ankle swelling may indicate the presence of cor pulmonale. Symptoms 
of depression and/or anxiety merit specific enquiry when obtaining the medical history because they are common in 
COPD,(335) are associated with poorer health status, increased risk of exacerbations, and emergency hospital admission , 
and are treatable.(336) 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF COPD  
In some patients with COPD, a clear distinction from asthma is difficult using current imaging and physiological testing 
techniques, since the two conditions share common traits and clinical expressions. (337) Most other potential differential 
diagnoses are easier to distinguish from COPD ( Figure 2.3). 
 
MEDICAL HISTORY  
A detailed medical history of a new patient who is known, or suspected, to have COPD should include:  
 
► Patient’s exposure to risk factors , such as smoking and environmental exposures  (household/outdoor) . 
► Past medical history, including early life events (prematurity, low birthweight, maternal smoking during 
pregnancy, passive smoking exposure during infancy), asthma, allergy, sinusitis, or nasal polyps; 
respiratory infections in childhood; HIV; tuberculosis. 
► Family history of COPD or other chronic respiratory disease.  
► Pattern of symptom development : COPD typically develops in adult life and most patients are conscious 
of increased breathlessness, more frequent or prolonged “winter colds,” and some social restriction for 
a number of years before seeking medical help.  
► History of exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for respiratory disorder. Patients may be aware of 
periodic worsening of symptoms even if these episodes have not been identified as exacerbations of 
COPD. 
► Presence of comorbiditie s, such as heart disease, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety and 
depression, and malignancies that may also contribute to restriction of activity.  
► Impact of disease on patient’s life , including limitation of activity, missed work and economic impact, 
effect on family routines, feelings of depression or anxiety, wellbeing , and sexual activity. 
► Social and family support available to the patient.  
► Possibilities for reducing risk factors, especially smoking cessation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  
Although an important part of patient care, a physical examination is rarely  (if ever) diagnostic in COPD. Physical signs 
of airflow obstruction are usually not present until significant impairment of lung function has occurred, (338,339) and 
detection based on physical examination has relatively low sensitivity and specificity. A number of physical signs (e.g., 
lung hyperinflation, cyanosis) may be present in COPD, but their absence does not exc lude the diagnosis.

 SPIROMETRY  
Forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction. It is a noninvasive, 
reproducible, cheap, and readily available test. Good quality spirometric measur ement is possible in any healthcare 
setting and all health care workers who care for people with COPD should have access to spirometry. Some of the 
factors needed to achieve accurate test results  are summarized in Figure 2.4.(340,341) Despite its good sensitivity, peak 
expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak 
specificity.(342,343)

 As shown in Figure 2.5, forced spirometry measures: (1) the volume of air forcibly exhaled from the point of maximal 
inspiration (forced vital capacity, FVC) ; (2) the volume of air exhaled during the first second of this maneuver (forced 
expiratory volume in one second, FEV1); and (3) the ratio of these two measurements ( FEV1/FVC). Spirometry 
measurements are evaluated by comparison with reference values (341,344) based on age, height  and sex.  
 
Figure 2.5A shows a normal spirometry tracing and Figure 2.5B shows a tracing obtained in a person with COPD. 
Patients with COPD typically show a decrease in both FEV1 (due to airflow obstruction) and (to a lesser degree) FVC 
(due to gas trapping) . 
 
 
 
In line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post -bronchodilator values 
when considering a diagnosis of COPD.  Historically, post bronchodilator values were considered more appropriate for 
confirming a diagnosis of f ixed airflow obstruction as they were thought to be more reproducible, to be useful in 
excluding asthma and could identify volume responders to bronchodilators in whom the obstruction was revealed by 
bronchodilator-induced increase in FVC.(345) However, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little 
value in differentiating asthma from COPD ,(346) that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible (347) and obstruction 
only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon .(348) Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more 
time consuming and this may deter clinicians from performing spirometry.  GOLD states that pre-bronchodilator 
spirometry can be used as an initial test to investigate whether symptomatic patients have airflow obstruction.  If the 
pre-bronchodilator spirometry does not show obstruction (see below for definition) performing post -bronchodilator 
spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD, in which case an FVC volume response 
may reveal FEV1/FVC < 0.7. Further tests to investigate the cause of the patient’s symptoms and follow -up, including 
repeating the spirometry after an interval, may be required.  If the pre -bronchodilator values show obstruction the

 diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post -bronchodilator measurements.  Individuals with a pre-
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7 that increases to ≥ 0.7 post-bronchodilator have been shown to have an increased 
risk of future development of COPD, and should be followed closely .(349) 
 
The spirometric criterion for airflow obstruction selected by GOLD for the diagnosis of COPD remains a post-
bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC < 0.7. This criterion is simple and independent of reference values  because it relates 
to variables measured in the same individual , and has been used in all the clinical trials that form the evidence base 
from which treatment recommendations are drawn. It should be noted that the use of a fixed FEV1/FVC ratio (< 0.7) 
to define airflow obstruction may result in over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly, (350,351) and under-diagnosis in 
approximately 1% of young adults,(351-353) especially in mild disease, compared to using a cut -off based on the lower 
limit of normal (LLN) values for FEV1/FVC. If COPD is suspected in younger adults (age < 50 years) who have a repeated 
fixed ratio ≥ 0.7, comparing the ratio to a predicted LLN may help when deciding how to best manage this small number 
of patients. 
 
The LLN values are based on the normal distribution and classify the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal. 
From a scientific or clinical perspective, it is difficult to determine which of these criteria will result in optimal COPD 
diagnostic accuracy. However, LLN values are highly dependent on the choice of valid reference equations using post -
bronchodilator FEV1, and there are no longitudinal studies available validating the use of the LLN, or studies using 
reference equations in populations wh ere smoking is not the major cause of COPD.  Using the fixed ratio is not inferior 
to LLN regarding prognosis. (354) 
 
It is important to emphasize that airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible is not specific for COPD; the clinical 
context and risk factors should also be considered. Airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible may also be found in 
patients with asthma and other diseases.  
 
Normal spirometry may be defined by a new approach from the Global Lung Initiative (GLI). (355,356) Using GLI equations, 
z scores (the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score (i.e., an observed value or data point) 
is above or below the mean value of what is being measured)  were calculated for FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. The results 
were compared to fixed ratio data. The findings suggest that among adults with GLI -defined normal spirometry, the 
use of a fixed ratio may misclassify individuals as having respiratory impairment. It is important that these findings are 
reproduced in other cohorts.  
 
Importantly, the risk of misdiagnosis and over -treatment of individual patients using the fixed ratio as a diagnostic 
criterion is limited, as spirometry is only one biologic measurement  to establish the clinical diagnosis of COPD  in the 
appropriate clinical context  (symptoms and risk factors ). Diagnostic simplicity and consistency are crucial for the busy 
clinician. Thus, GOLD favors the use of the fixed ratio over LLN.  
 
Assessment of the presence or absence of airflow obstruction based on a single measurement of the post -
bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio should be confirmed by repeat spirometry on a separate occasion if the value is 
between 0.60 and 0.80, as in some cases the ratio may change as a result of biological variation when measured at a 
later interval.(357,358) If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.6 0 it is very unlikely to rise 
spontaneously above 0.7.(357)  
 
While post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, assessing the degree of 
reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform 
therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended. (359) The degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time 
and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma, or to predict the response to long -term treatment 
with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. (360) Accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining 
spirometry measurements during follow -up of patients. Figure 2.6 shows the role of spirometry in patients with COPD.

Interpretation of the severity of lung function impairment is dependent on having appropriate reference values. The 
Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study analyzed pre -bronchodilator spirometry data from 153,996 
healthy people with less than 5 pack -year smoking histories in 17 countries and observed wide variation in lung 
function.(46) Compared with individuals living in North America or Europe, people living in Southeast Asia had FEV1 
values that were on average 31% lower, adjusted for age, height and sex. Similarly, those living in sub -Saharan Africa, 
East Asia, Middle East and South America had FEV1 values that were on average 21%, 13%, 11%, and 6% lower than 
individuals living in North America or Europe, respectively, independent of age, height, sex, and smoking status. (46) 
Unless relevant predicted values are used the severity of airflow obstruction will be overestimated.  Even in high 
income countries, lung reference values change over time and require periodic revision. (361) 
 
SCREENING AND CASE-FINDING 
The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. (362,363) In 
asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is 
probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack -years of smoking, recurrent 
chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be co nsidered 
as a method for early case finding. (364-366)  
 
Both FEV1 and FVC predict all -cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, and abnormal lung function identifies 
a subgroup of smokers at increased risk for lung cancer. This has been the basis of an argument that spirometry should 
be employed as a glob al health assessment tool. (367-369) A risk score based on routine data from electronic health 
records in primary care may facilitate case -finding and be cost -effective.(370,371) However, data to support that 
population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes 
in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. (363) This may reflect the design 
and application of current case finding instruments that have not been utilized to identify patients with undiagnosed 
COPD who are most likely to benefit from existing therapies. (372,373) Novel approaches to screening have been 
developed that incorporate exposures, symptoms and health care utilization and simple peak flow measurement; one 
of these has been developed for low‐ and middle‐income countries and has shown discriminatory properti es.(374,375) 
GOLD advocates active case finding (364,376,377) i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, 
but not screening spirometry. Systematic active case -finding in a primary care setting via mail -out of a screening

 questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients. (378) The potential use of 
spirometry in children, adolescents and young adults to identify individuals with poor lung development at risk of 
COPD and other chronic conditions later in life merits future investigation. (41)  
 
COPD case-finding tools have been created based on existing epidemiologic literature or expert opinion (373,379,380) or 
with a multimodality approach. (374,375) Increasingly, it appears that the combination of questionnaires with simple 
physiological measurements enhances the operating characteristics and performance of these approaches. (379,381,382) 
In a variety of settings case -finding has been able to identify previously undiagnosed COPD. (378,381,383,384) In general, 
these tools identify a high proportion of patients with mild or minimally symptomatic disease, exhibiting modest 
sensitivity and specificity ,(385) or higher specificity but low sensitivity .(386) COPD screening/case -finding in primary care 
has been demonstrated to have a small but significant impact on increasing rates of diagnoses and physician’s clinical 
actions but with limited data suggesting a significant impact on patient outcomes. (378,387-389) In the Veterans Affairs 
system, the use of a clinical decision support system algorithm that incorporates case -finding for COPD and AATD, 
improved COPD over - and under-diagnosis and screening rates of AATD in a primary care setting. (390) It remains vital 
to critically assess how the introduction of case finding approaches can optimally improve clinician behavior, enhance 
health care utilization, and improve patient outcomes while ensuring that patients identified with these techniques 
have access to affordable and clinically and cost -effective interventions. (2,391,392) In a prospective study in China the 
COPD Assessment in Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk (CAPTURE) tool 
showed a good sensitivity to identify COPD patients who may require treatment because of elevated symptoms, risk  
of exacerbations or hospitalization. (393) 
Screening for COPD in targeted populations  
The United States Preventative Service Task Force (USPSTF) recommend ed against screening for COPD in 
asymptomatic adults. (394) This recommendation was based upon a systematic review of data from asymptomatic or 
mildly symptomatic COPD patients enrolled in pharmacologic al or non-pharmacological clinical trials. This 
recommendation is not applicable to populations at increased risk for COPD (e.g., those undergoing annual low dose 
chest computed tomography (LDCT)  for lung cancer detection, particularly when airways or parenchymal 
abnormalities are found incidentally) or with radiologically identified structural abnormalities found on chest imaging 
done for clinical respiratory complaints (e.g., emphysema, airway wall thickening, bronchiecta sis, etc.).  
 
Leveraging lung cancer imaging for COPD screening  
Annual LDCT imaging of the chest is recommended by the USPSTF to diagnose lung cancer earlier among individuals 
aged 50 to 80 years with a ≥ 20 pack-year smoking history.  Clinical trials have shown annual LDCT significantly 
improves survival.(395,396) Lung cancer and COPD share common risk  factors, and COPD is also an independent risk factor 
for lung cancer and represents the major comorbidity affecting survival in patients with lung cancer .(395,397-399) 
Thoroughly assessing symptoms and performing spirometry in individuals undergoing LDCT for lung cancer screening  
therefore represents a unique opportunity to simultaneously screen patients for both the presence of unrecognized 
symptoms of COPD and airflow obstruction. 
 
Studies that have evaluated patients for COPD symptoms and performed  spirometry at lung cancer screening have 
reported airflow obstruction in 34-57% of individuals, emphysema in 68 -73% and no prior diagnosis of COPD in 
67%.(398,400,401)  Male sex, younger age, lower smoking duration and being asymptomatic were associated with 
detection of airflow obstruction without a prior diagnosis of COPD. (401) Those without a prior diagnosis of COPD were 
less symptomatic, however, the prevalence of symptoms was still high and found in over 50% of individuals. The 
prevalence of the underdiagnosis of COPD in those undergoing lung cancer screening can approach 90%  in some 
reports.(368,402-407)  
 
In a lung cancer screening cohort, over half of those with visually detected emphysema had airflow obstruction. (408)

 Quantitative analysis of density can also be used to detect COPD with varying sensitivity and specificity depending on 
the threshold chosen.  In the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST), among individuals > 65 years, a threshold 
of 1% quantitative emphysema was associated with a sensitivity of around 65% for women and 75% for men and a 
specificity of over 70% and 65% respectively.(409) Deep learning approaches are also being investigated that could 
diagnose COPD from lung cancer screening CT scans with results varying depending on the method and cohort 
analyzed.(410) 
 
Airflow obstruction or emphysema are markers of an increased risk for lung cancer. The severity of airflow obstruction 
and the presence of emphysema are both independent risk factors and may be useful indicators for triaging patients 
for more careful lung cancer surveillance. (368,395,396,403-407)  
 
Leveraging incidental lung imaging abnormalities for COPD screening  
Besides cigarette smoking other factors can increase the risk of COPD (e.g., developmental, genetic, environmental 
exposures, childhood infections, etc.) and these individuals may undergo chest imaging for evaluation of respiratory 
symptoms.  These individuals have no or minimal e xposure to cigarette smoking and are usually of younger age and 
distinct from the population undergoing annual LDCT for lung cancer screening. The CT scans themselves can be used 
to help identify individuals at increased risk for COPD in the non -lung cancer screened population and prompt 
consideration for spirometry. (368,403-407) 
 
Emphysema is a hallmark of COPD and easily detected on chest imaging, either through visual inspection via a 
radiologist or through quantitative lung density. (408-410) Lung imaging may also identify other abnormalities that may 
indicate the presence of COPD including air trapping, airway wall thickening and mucus plugging. (401,402,411-413) These 
abnormalities may not only indicate the presence of airflow obstruction but indicate patients that might have a more 
rapid decline in lung function and worse quality of life. (414-417) 
 
While quantitative analysis of LDCT data is often not available in clinical settings, the presence of emphysema and 
other airway abnormalities should raise clinical suspicion for COPD and lead to a detailed assessment of symptoms 
and consideration for pulm onary function testing if not previously performed.  
 
There is currently a missed  opportunity to perform spirometry in people at high risk of having COPD during lung cancer 
screening programs or when incidental lung abnormalities are found on imaging that may indicate the presence of 
COPD. The use of spirometry in targeted patients und ergoing lung cancer screening or when incidental imaging 
abnormalities are found consistent with parenchymal or airway manifestations of airways disorders is recommended 
by GOLD.(418) 
 
INITIAL ASSESSMENT  
Once the diagnosis of COPD has been confirmed by spirometry, in order to guide therapy COPD assessment must focus 
on determining the following five fundamental aspects:  
 
► Severity of airflow obstruction 
► Nature and magnitude of current symptoms 
► Previous history of moderate and severe exacerbations  
► Blood eosinophil count  
► Presence and type of other diseases (multimorbidity)

 Severity of airflow obstruction  
In the presence of FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7 the assessment of airflow obstruction severity in COPD (note that this may be 
different from severity of the disease) is based on the post -bronchodilator value of FEV1 (% reference) . The specific 
spirometric cut points are proposed for purposes of simplicity  (Figure 2.7).  
 
 
 
Symptoms 
Because there is only a weak correlation between the severity of airflow obstruction ( Figure 2.7) and the symptoms 
experienced by the patient or the impairment of their health status,(419,420) formal assessment of symptoms using 
validated questionnaires  is required. 
 
Dyspnea questionnaire: the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale 
The mMRC scale was the first questionnaire developed to measure  breathlessness, which is a key symptom in many 
patients with COPD, although often unrecognized .(421) (Figure 2.8) Of note, the mMRC score relates well to other 
multidimensional health status measures (422) and predicts future mortality risk. (423,424)

Multidimensional questionnaires  
It is now recognized that COPD impacts patients beyond dyspnea. (425) For this reason, multidimensional questionnaires 
are recommended. The most  comprehensive disease -specific health status questionnaires such as the Chronic 
Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (426) and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (427) are important research 
tools but they are too complex to use in routine practice . Shorter comprehensive measures , such as the COPD 
Assessment Test (CAT ™) and the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ©) have been developed and are suitable  for use in 
the clinic. Below we discuss the CAT™ and the SGRQ. 
 
The CAT™* is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses  health status in patients with COPD (Figure 2.9).(428) It was 
developed to be applicable worldwide and validated translations are available in a wide range of languages. The score 
ranges from 0 to 40, correlates very closely with the SGRQ, and has been extensively documented in numerous 
publications.(429)

The SGRQ is the most widely documented comprehensive measure; scores < 25 are uncommon in diagnosed COPD 
patients(168) and scores ≥ 25 are very uncommon in healthy persons. (430,431) Therefore, it is recommended that a 
symptom score equivalent to SGRQ score ≥ 25 should be used as the threshold for considering regular treatment for 
symptoms including breathlessness, particularly since this corresponds to the range of severity seen in p atients 
recruited to the trials that have provided the evidence base for treatment recommendations. The equivalent cut-point 
for the CAT™ is 10.(432) An equivalent mMRC score cannot be calculated because a simple breathlessness cut -point 
cannot equate to a comprehensive symptom score cut -point. The great majority of patients with an SGRQ of ≥ 25 will 
have an mMRC of ≥ 1; however patients with mMRC < 1 m ay also have a number of other COPD symptoms. (433) For 
this reason, the use of a comprehensive symptom assessment is recommended. However, because use of the mMRC 
is widespread, an mMRC of ≥ 2 is still included as a threshold for separating “less breathlessness” from “more 
breathlessness.” Nevertheless, u sers are cautioned that assessment of other symptoms is required. (433) 
Exacerbation risk  
Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are episodes of acute respiratory symptom worsening often associated with incre ased 
local and systemic inflammation  (see Chapter 4).(434-437) ECOPD are key events in the natural history of the disease 
because they impact significantly on the health status of the patient (often for a prolonged period of time), enhance 
the rate of lung function decline, worsen the prognosis of the patient and are associated with most of the healthcare 
costs of COPD.(438) ECOPD rates vary greatly between patients (439) and during follow-up.(440) The best predictor of having

 frequent exacerbations (defined as two or more exacerbations per year) is the previous history of exacerbations.(439) 
Worsening of airflow obstruction is associated with an increasing prevalence of exacerbations, hospitalization (377,441) 
and risk of death.(168,442)  
Blood eosinophil count  
A number of studies have shown that blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of the effect of ICS (added on 
top of regular maintenance bronchodilator treatment) in preventing future exacerbations  and blood eosinophil counts 
are recommended by GOLD to guide the use of ICS as part of pharmacological management ( see Chapter 3, Figure 3.7 
& Figure 3.9).(443-448)  
 
There is evidence that on average blood eosinophil counts are higher in COPD patients, although there is marked 
overlap with controls. (449,450) Higher blood eosinophil counts in COPD patients are associated with increased lung 
eosinophil numbers and the presence of higher levels of markers of type -2 inflammation in the airways, although the 
concordance between blood and lung/airways T2 biomarkers  is not strict.(451,452) These differences in airway 
inflammation may explain the differential response to ICS treatment according to blood eosinophil counts. (453) 
 
The repeatability of blood eosinophil counts in a large primary care population appear s reasonable,(454) although 
greater variability is observed at higher thresholds. (455) Better reproducibility is observed at the lower thresholds (e.g., 
100 cells/µL).(456) Blood eosinophil counts can help clinicians estimate the likelihood of a beneficial preventive response 
to the addition of ICS to regular bronchodilator treatment, and thus can be used as a biomarker in conjunction with 
clinical assessment when making decis ions regarding ICS use.  
 
Cohort studies have produced differing results with regard to the ability of blood eosinophils to predict future 
exacerbation outcomes, with either no relationship (457) or a positive relationship reported. (458,459) Differences between 
studies are likely to be related to different previous exacerbation histories and ICS use. There is insufficient evidence 
to recommend that blood eosinophils should be used to predict future exacerbation risk on an individual basis in COPD 
patients. Greater FEV1 decline was observed in mild to moderate COPD patients with higher blood eosinophil counts 
in a population where ICS use was low, (460) highlighting the possible usefulness of blood eosinophil counts as a 
prognostic biomarker for lung function decline when not confounded by ICS use. In younger individuals without COPD, 
higher blood eosinophil counts are associated with increased risk of s ubsequent development of COPD. (461) 
Multimorbidity 
People with COPD often suffer other concomitant chronic diseases (multimorbidity) . This can occur in patients with 
mild, moderate or severe airflow obstruction .(168) Multimorbidity influences mortality and hospitalizations 
independently of the severity of airflow obstruction,(462) and deserves specific treatment. Therefore, comorbid 
conditions should be looked for routinely, and treated appropriately  if present, in any patient with COPD. 
Recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment of severity, and management of individual comorbid diseases are the 
same as for patients  without COPD.  
 
Frequent multimorbid diseases  in COPD include cardiovascular disease, (42) metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, 
depression and anxiety, likely in relation to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, smoking, alcohol, diet and inactivity). (438,463-
465) Besides, COPD itself may increase the risk for other comorbid diseases (e.g., COPD (particularly emphysema) and 
lung cancer).(466,467) Whether the association between COPD and lung cancer is due to common risk factors (e.g., 
smoking), involvement of share d susceptibility genes and/or impaired clearance  of carcinogens is unclear. COPD can 
also have significant extra pulmonary (systemic) effects including weight loss, nutritional abnormalities, and skeletal 
muscle dysfunction. The latter is characterized by both sarcopenia (loss of muscle cells) and abnormal function of the 
remaining cells.(468) Its causes are likely multifactorial (e.g., inactivity, poor diet, inflammation and /or hypoxia) and it 
can contribute to exercise intolerance and poor health status in patients with COPD. Importantly, skeletal muscle

 dysfunction is a modifiable source of exercise intolerance  by rehabilitation.(469) A more detailed description of the 
management of COPD and comorbidities is provided in Chapter 5. 
Combined initial COPD assessment  
In 2011, GOLD proposed to move from the simple spirometric grading system  for disease severity assessment and 
treatment to a combined assessment strategy based on the level of symptoms (mMRC or CAT ™), the severity of airflow 
obstruction (GOLD grades 1-4), and the frequency of previous exacerbations. This classification was proposed to guide 
initial pharmacological treatment. The main step forward achieved by this combined assessment strategy was to 
incorporate patient-reported outcomes and highlight the imp ortance of exacerbation prevention in the management 
of COPD. The initial version of the combined assessment relied on both the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD 
grades 1-4) and the frequency of previous exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk.  
 
The severity of airflow obstruction was subsequently removed from this combined assessment scheme considering its 
lower precision at the individual level (versus that at a population level) to predict outcomes and drive treatment 
decisions, while complexifying the use of the classification by clinicians .(420,442,470,471)  
 
In the 2023 GOLD report, GOLD proposed a further evolution of the ABCD combined assessment tool that recognize d 
the clinical relevance of exacerbations, independently of the level of symptoms of the patient. Figure 2.10 presents 
this proposal. The A and B groups remained unchanged, but the C and D groups were merged into a single group 
termed “E” to highlight the clinical relevance of exacerbations. It was acknowledged that this proposal would have to 
be validated by appropriate clinical research.

 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS  
In cases where there is a marked discordance between the level of airflow obstruction and the perceived symptoms, 
a more detailed evaluation should be carried out to better understand lung mechanics (e.g., full lung function tests  
and exercise testing), lung structure (e.g., computed tomography) and/or comorbidities (e.g., ischemic heart disease) 
that might impact patient symptoms.  
Physiological tests  
Lung volumes 
COPD patients exhibit gas trapping (a rise in residual volume) from the early stages of the disease, and as airflow 
obstruction worsens, static hyperinflation (an increase in total lung capacity) occurs , particularly during exercise 
(dynamic hyperinflation) . These changes can be documented by body plethysmography, or less accurately by helium 
dilution lung volume measurement. These measurements help characterize the severity of COPD but are not essential 
to patient management.  
 
Carbon monoxide d iffusing capacity of the lungs (DLco) 
The single breath DLco  measurement (472) evaluates the gas transfer properties of the respiratory system. DLco is well-
standardized and with valid predicted values of practical utility .(344,473-475) The advent of reliable portable systems 
capable of providing accurate determinations in the field, expands its potential use as a complement to the 
information provided by spirometry .(476) DLco should be measured  in any person with symptoms (dyspnea) 
disproportionate to the degree of airflow obstruction  since reduced DLco values < 60% predicted are associated with 
increased symptoms , decreased exercise capacity , worse health status ,(477-479) and increased risk of death, 
independently of the severity of airflow obstruction and  other clinical variables .(480-483) Additionally, in COPD patients, 
low DLco values help preclude surgical lung resection in patients with lung cancer(484) while in smokers without airflow 
obstruction, values < 80% predicted (as a marker of emphysema) signal an increased risk for developing COPD over  
time.(485)  
 
Over time people with COPD have an accelerated decline in DLco compared to smokers without the disease , and this 
decline is significantly greater in women than men .(486,487) However, DLco decline is slow, and years of follow up are 
often needed before a meaningful change in DLco is detected.  
 
Oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement  
Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate a patient’s arterial oxygen saturation and need for supplemental oxygen 
therapy at the point-of-care and should be used to assess all patients with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure 
or right heart failure. If peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is ≤  92%, arterial blood gases should be measured due to 
the imperfect correlation between oxygen saturation detected via pulse oximetry as compared to arterial blood 
gas.(488) Further, pulse oximetry does not provide information on PaCO 2 or pH, which may have potential therapeutic 
implications (e.g., non -invasive ventilation).  
 
Exercise testing and assessment of physical activity  
In some cases, patients may complain of minimal symptoms despite severe airflow obstruction. This may be due to 
reduced dyspnea perception (489) and/or life-style adaptations (sedentarism) to reduce dyspnea generation. In these 
cases, exercise tests such as the 6-minute walking distance may reveal that the patients are severely constrained and 
do need more intense treatment (e.g., rehabilitation) than the initial evaluation would have suggested.    
 
Further, objectively measured exercise impairment, assessed by a reduction in self -paced walking distance (490,491) or 
during incremental exercise testing in a laboratory, (492) is a powerful indicator of health status impairment and

 predictor of prognosis. (493) Laboratory testing using cycle or treadmill ergometry can assist in identifying co -existing or 
alternative conditions e.g., cardiac diagnoses. Walking tests can be useful for assessing disability and risk of 
mortality(494) and are used to assess the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. Both the paced shuttle walk test (495) 
and the self-paced 6-minute walk test can be used. (496,497) As the course length has a substantial impact on the distance 
walked, existing reference equations established for a 30 meter course cannot be applied to predict the distance 
achieved on shorter courses. (498)  
 
Monitoring of physical activity may be more relevant regarding prognosis than evaluating only exercise capacity. (499) 
This can be conducted using accelerometers or multi -sensor instruments. 
Imaging 
Chest X-ray 
A chest X-ray is not useful to establish a diagnosis in COPD, but it is valuable in excluding alternative diagnoses and 
establishing the presence of significant comorbidities such as concomitant respiratory (pulmonary fibrosis, 
bronchiectasis, pleural dise ases), skeletal (e.g., kyphoscoliosis), and cardiac diseases (e.g., cardiomegaly). Radiological 
changes associated with COPD  may include signs of lung hyperinflation (flattened diaphragm and an increase in the 
volume of the retrosternal air space), hyperlu cency of the lungs, and rapid tapering of the vascular markings.  
 
Computed tomography (CT)  
In recent years computed tomography (CT) has become increasingly available, both as a research tool and in clinical 
practice, providing additional insights into the structural and pathophysiologic abnormalities present in COPD.  This 
has led to enhanced un derstanding of disease phenotype s, severity, and outcome s. 
   
From a clinical perspective, emphysema distribution and severity can be readily discerned and can assist with decision 
making for lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS) or endobronchial valve placement. While historically this has been 
performed based on expert radiologist visual analysis, particularly for LVRS, increasingly quantitative analysis for 
emphysema extent, location and fissure integrity is also being performed to assist with endobronchial valve therapy 
decision making.  The presence of emphysema i s also associated with more rapid progression of FEV1 decline and 
mortality and increased likelihood of development of lung cancer. (483) Further, about 30% of COPD patients have 
bronchiectasis visible on CT, which is now the radiological examination of choice when this is suspected. Bronchiectasis 
is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and mortality, (500) although it is not yet known whether treatment 
according to bronchiectasis guidelines influences these clinical outcomes.  
 
Historically chest CT has not been considered a requirement for COPD diagnosis, but increasingly more COPD patients 
do undergo CT as part of evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected on chest X -ray or assessment for concurrent lung 
disease. Recently, the nu mber of patients who would potentially benefit from chest CT has also expanded.  First, this 
is due to the recent lowering of the age for lung cancer screening to 50 years old.  Second, the advent of endobronchial 
valve therapy for emphysema has also expan ded the pool of patients where CT evaluation may be helpful, in particular 
patients with post -bronchodilator FEV1 between 15% -45% and evidence of marked hyperinflation on 
plethysmography.(501) In such instances, quantification of emphysema on chest CT by lobe and ensuring fissure 
integrity of the target lobe is required as part of the evaluation process.  
 
More detailed computer assisted CT analysis enables quantification of airway abnormality as well, although these 
methods are less well standardized than the methods used for emphysema quantification. Hence, historically airway 
measures have been used more in the research setting. While segmental and subsegmental measures of wall thickness 
can be made directly, measurements of small airways (< 2 mm diameter) must be inferred by comparing inspiratory 
and expiratory to identify areas of non -emphysematous gas t rapping.  Validated algorithms are becoming increasingly 
available, even in the clinical setting, that can identify small airway abnormality through this method. (502,503) Small

 airway abnormality may also be present even among individuals without detectable spirometric obstruction and 
identify individuals at increased risk for lung function decline. (504)  It should also be noted that CT imaging of the chest 
can also provide a wealth of information about COPD comorbidities including coronary artery calcium, pulmonary 
artery enlargement, bone density and muscle mass. Such CT extracted features have been shown to be independently 
associated with all-cause mortality.(505) As technology advances, such information is likely to become increasingly 
available to clinicians to enhance patient management.  
 
In summary, for COPD patients with persistent exacerbations, symptoms out of proportion to disease severity on lung 
function testing, FEV1 less than 45% predicted with significant hyperinflation and gas trapping, or for those who meet 
criteria for lung cancer screening, chest CT imaging should be considered ( Figure 2.11). 
 
 
 
 
Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA)  
Findings suggestive of parenchymal lung fibrosis or inflammation are common on chest CT imaging of both smokers 
and nonsmokers, and have been termed interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) when discovered incidentally in patients 
without known interstitial lung disease (ILD). (506) The prevalence of ILA ranges from 4% to 9% among older (over 60 
years) adults, and spans the spectrum from subclinical findings to clinical disease. (506) Among 4,360 COPDGene 
participants, ILA was present in 8% of individuals, with half meeting criteria for suspected ILD, which was defined as 
definite fibrosis on CT, FVC less than 80% predicted or DLCO less than 70% predicted. (255,507) Individuals with suspected 
ILD had increased respiratory symptoms and mortality. (507) Fibrotic ILA (i.e., those with traction bronchiectasis, 
architectural distortion and honeycombing) are more likely to progress and are associated with poor outcomes, 
especially when combined with emphysema. (508,509) Given the clinical relevance of ILA, multiple studies support clinical 
evaluation, risk stratification and follow up monitoring  of individuals with these findings.

 Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)  
The World Health Organization recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of COPD should be screened once for 
AATD, especially in areas with high AATD prevalence.(510,511) Although the classical patient is young (< 45 years) with 
panlobular basal emphysema, it has become recognized that delay in diagnosis has led to identification of some AATD 
patients when they are older and have a more typical distribution of emphysema (c entrilobular apical).(512) A low 
concentration (< 20% normal) is highly suggestive of homozygous deficiency. Family members should be screened and, 
together with the patient, referred to specialist cent ers for advice and management  (see Chapter 3).

Several variables identify patients at increased risk for mortality including FEV1, exercise tolerance assessed by walking 
distance or peak oxygen consumption, weight loss, and reduction of arterial oxygenation. The BODE (Body mass index, 
Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise) method gives a composite score that is a better predictor of subsequent survival 
than any single component. (513,514) Simpler alternatives that do not include an exercise test have been suggested but 
need validation across a wide range of disease severities and clinical settings to confirm that they are suitable for 
routine clinical use.(515,516)  
Biomarkers 
There is rapidly increasing interest in the use of biomarkers in COPD. Biomarkers are ‘characteristics (either clinical, 
functional, biologic and/or imaging) that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological 
or pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to therapeutic interventions’. In general such data has proven 
difficult to interpret, largely as a result of weak associa tions and lack of reproducibility between large patient 
cohorts.(517)  
 
At present blood eosinophil  counts (≥ 300 cells/µL) provide guidance to identify COPD patients at higher risk of 
exacerbations and more likely to benefit from preventive treatment with inhaled corticosteroids  (see Chapter 3).(517)  
Treatable traits 
To address the heterogeneity and complexity of COPD  in clinical practice, a strategy based on so -called ‘Treatable 
Traits’ (TTs) has been proposed. (518) TTs can be identified based on phenotypic recognition and/or on deep 
understanding of critical causal pathways (endotypes) through validated biomarkers (e.g., high circulating eosinophil 
levels (a biomarker) identify COPD patients at risk of exacerbations  (a TT) in whom treatment with inhaled 
corticosteroid is most effective). (519) TTs can co-exist in the same patient (337) and change with time (spontaneously or 
because of treatment). GOLD highlights the role of two key TTs (persistent dyspnea and exacerbations) in the follow 
up algorithm of pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) but there are many more pulmonary and extra -pulmonary 
traits, as well as behavioral/social risk factors, that merit individual attention and treatment if present. (337)

CHAPTER 3: PREVENTION & MANAGEMENT OF COPD   
KEY POINTS:  
• All individuals who smoke should be strongly encouraged and supported to quit.  Nicotine 
replacement and pharmacotherapy  reliably increase long -term smoking abstinence rates. 
Legislative smoking bans and counseling, delivered by healthcare professionals, improve quit rates.  
There is no evidence to support the  effectiveness and safety of e -cigarettes as a smoking cessation 
aid at present. 
• The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations. The management 
strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the 
history of exacerbations.  
• Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of 
exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance. Data suggest beneficial effects on 
rates of lung function decline and mortality.  
• Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of 
symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side -effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the 
patient’s response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices. 
• Inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.  
• COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against SARS -CoV-2 infection and people with COPD should 
have the COVID-19 vaccination in line with national recommendations.  
• Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination decrease the incidence of lower respiratory 
tract infections.  
• The CDC recommends: the Tdap vaccination (dTaP/dTPa; pertussis, tetanus and diptheria) for COPD 
patients who were not vaccinated in adolescence ; routine use of shingles vaccine in all COPD 
patients; the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for individuals over 60  years and/or with 
chronic heart or lung disease.  
• Pulmonary rehabilitation with its core components, including exercise training combined with 
disease-specific education, improves exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life across all 
grades of COPD severity.  
• In patients with severe resting chronic hypoxemia (PaO 2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg if there is cor 
pulmonale or secondary polycythemia), long -term oxygen therapy improves survival.  
• In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long -term 
oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely. However, individual patient factors must be 
considered when evaluating the patient’s need for supplemental oxygen.  
• In patients with severe chronic hypercapnia and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory 
failure, long-term non-invasive ventilation may decrease mortality and prevent re -hospitalization. 
• In select patients with advanced emphysema refractory to optimized medical care, surgical or 
bronchoscopic interventional treatments may be beneficial.  
• Palliative approaches are effective in controlling symptoms in advanced COPD.

 INTRODUCTION  
The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk ( Figure 3.1). COPD patients should have an 
assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors 
and comorbidities (see Chapter 2) to guide management.  
 
 
 
Pharmacological and non -pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary (see below) and further reviews 
undertaken (Figure 3.2). This chapter contains recommendations on how to manage patients with COPD in clinical 
practice and summarizes the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of maintenance and prevention strategies 
in COPD on which the recommendations are based.  
 
IDENTIFY AND REDUCE EXPOSURE TO RISK FACTORS  
Identification and reduction of exposure to risk factors is important not only for the primary prevention of COPD but 
also as part of the management of a COPD patient.  Cigarette smoking is the most commonly encountered and easily 
identifiable risk factor  for COPD, and smoking cessation should be continually encouraged for all individuals who 
smoke. Reduction of total personal exposure to occupational dusts, fumes, and gases , and to household and outdoor 
air pollutants, should also be addressed (Figure 3.3).

 Smoking cessation  
Smoking cessation is a key intervention for all COPD patients who continue to smoke . Healthcare providers are pivotal 
in delivering smoking cessation messages and interventions and should encourage patients  to quit at every available 
opportunity (Figure 3.4).  
 
A significant proportion of people with COPD continue to smoke despite knowing they have the disease ( approximately 
40% of those with COPD are current smokers), and this behavior has a negative impact on prognosis and progression 
of the disease.(520) Smoking cessation has the greatest capacity to influence the natural history of COPD , it also 
improves daily symptoms, (521) and decreases the frequency of exacerbations .(522)  
 
For smokers with COPD, the quitting may be more challenging than for smokers without COPD due to greater nicotine 
dependence, lower self -efficacy and lower self -esteem.(523-525) In addition, it has been reported that depression is more 
common in smokers with COPD (526) and this could contribute to failed attempts to quit. (526,527) Despite these adverse 
conditions, if effective time and resources are dedicated to smoking cessation, long -term quit rates of 14% to 27% 
have been reported.(527)

 As for all smokers, smoking cessation treatment for people with COPD should be adapted to the individual ’s needs and 
according to the level of tobacco dependence. There is evidence that a combination of counseling and 
pharmacotherapy is the most effective smoking cessation treatment for people with COPD.(527-529) The complexity of 
the smoking cessation process is largely determined by nicotine addiction . An accurate assessment of nicotine 
dependence should therefore be carried out for all patients. Some indicators of high nicotine dependence are: smoking 
within 30 min of waking up, smoking at night, consuming ≥ 20 cigarettes per day, a score of 7 to 10 on the Fagerström 
scale or 5 to 6 on the Heaviness of Smoking Index. (530,531) 
 
In addition to individual approaches to smoking cessa tion, legislative smoking bans are effective in increasing quit 
rates and reducing harm from second -hand smoke exposure .(532) 
Advice and counseling interventions  
A five-step program for intervention ( Figure 3.4)(533-535) provides a helpful strategic framework to guide healthcare 
providers interested in helping their patients stop smoking .(533,535,536) When possible, the patient should be referred to 
a comprehensive smoking cessation program that incorporates behavio r change techniques enhancing patient 
motivation and confidence , patient education, and pharmacological and non -pharmacological interventions. 
Recommendations for treating tobacco use and dependence are summarized in Figure 3.5.(533) Because tobacco 
dependence is a chronic disease ,(533,535) clinicians should recognize that relapse is common and reflects the chronic 
nature of dependence and addiction, and does not represent failure on the part of the patient or the clinician .

 Counseling delivered by physicians and other health profe ssionals significantly increases  quit rates over self-initiated 
strategies.(537) Even brief (3-minute) periods of counseling urging a smoker to quit improve smoking cessation rates .(537)  
 
In patients with COPD a network meta -analysis showed a trend for smoking cessation counseling alone to be superior 
than usual care.(538) Another study reported a continuous one -year abstinence rate of 1.4% for usual care, 2.6% for 
minimal counseling (<  90 min), 6% for intensive counseling ( ≥ 90 min), and 12.3% for intensive counseling plus 
pharmacotherapy.(528) However, controversy remains as to whether more intensive individual counseling is more 
effective when combined with pharmacotherapy. (538) 
 
Household  and outdoor air pollution  
Reducing exposure to household and outdoor air pollution requires a combination of public policy, local and national 
resources, cultural changes, and protective steps taken by individual patients. Reduction of exposure to smoke from 
biomass fuel is a crucial goal to reduce the prevalence of COPD worldwide. Efficient ventilation, non -polluting cooking 
stoves and similar interventions are feasible and should be recommended .(8,9)  
 
Occupational exposures  
There are no studies that demonstrate whether interventions that reduce occupational exposures also reduce the 
burden of COPD, but it seems logical to advise patients to avoid ongoing exposures to potential irritants e.g., dusts, 
fumes and gases, if possible.

 Vaccination s 
People with COPD should receive all recommended vaccinations  in line with the relevant local guidelines (Figure 3.6). 
Influenza vaccine  
Influenza vaccination can reduce serious illness (such as lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization )(539) 
and death in people with COPD.(540-543) Only a few studies have evaluated exacerbation s and they have shown 
significant reduction in the total number of exacerbations per vaccinated subject compared with those who received 
placebo.(540) Vaccines containing either killed or live inactivated viruses are recommended (544) as they are more 
effective in elderly people with COPD.(545) Findings from a population-based study suggested that people with COPD, 
particularly the elderly, ha d decreased risk of ischemic heart disease when they were vaccinated with influenza vaccine 
over many years.(546) Occurrence of adverse reactions is generally mild and transient.  
Pneumococcal vaccine s 
Pneumococcal vaccinations, pneumococcal conjugated vaccine ( PCV20 or PCV15) and pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV23), are approved for adults aged ≥ 65 years. They are also approved for  adults aged 19-64 years if they 
have an underlying medical condition such as chronic lung disease (including COPD, emphysema, and asthma), 
cigarette smoking, solid organ transplant etc. Pneumococcal vaccination is universally  recommended for adults in 
these age groups, if they have never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  previously, or if their previous 
pneumococcal vaccination  history is unknown. The current recommendation is PCV15 followed by PPSV23 OR one 
dose PCV20.(547) Adults who have only received PPSV23 may receive a PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15) ≥  1 year after their 
last PPSV23 dose (Figure 3.6).

 Specific data on the effects of PPSV and PCV in people with COPD are limited.(548) A systematic review of injectable 
vaccines in COPD patients identified twelve randomized studies for inclusion and observed injectable polyvalent 
pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community -acquired pneumonia, although no 
evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively 
rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate -quality evidence suggests the 
benefits of pneumococcal vaccina tion in COPD patients. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different 
pneumococcal vaccine types. (549) PPSV23 has been shown to reduce the incidence of community -acquired pneumonia 
in COPD patients < 65 years, with an FEV1 < 40% predicted, or comorbidities (especially cardiac comorbidities) .(550) The 
PCV13 has been shown to exhibit at least the same or greater immunogenicity than the PPSV23 up to two years after 
vaccination in COPD patients. (551) In a large RCT PCV13 demonstrated significant efficacy for the prevention of vaccine -
type community-acquired pneumonia (45 .6%) and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (75%) among adults ≥ 
65 years and the efficacy persisted for at least 4 years .(552) 
 
A study compared the effectiveness of PPSV23 and PCV13 in COPD patients over a 5 -year follow-up cohort study. 
Although both vaccines have comparable clinical effects during the first year after vaccination, PCV13 showed 
persistent clinical effectiveness duri ng the 5-year follow-up period. Pneumonia by year 5 after vaccination was 
registered in 47% of patients in the PPSV23 group, versus 3.3% of patients in the PCV13 group (p < 0.001). Similar 
effects were shown in the reduction of COPD exacerbations. (553) 
 
PCV15, PCV20, or PPSV23 can be co -administered with influenza vaccine in an adult immunization program, as 
concomitant administration (PCV15 or PPSV23 and QIV [Fluarix], PCV20 and adjuvanted QIV [Fluad]) has been 
demonstrated to be immunogenic and safe. (554)  
Respiratory syncytial virus  (RSV) vaccine 
The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) and the European 
Commission recommend use of  the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bivalent prefusion F  protein-based vaccine(555)  
and prefusion F protein vaccine(556) for individuals 60 years and older. Adults at the highest risk for severe RSV illness 
include adults with chronic heart or lung disease, immune compromise, and those living in nursing homes or long -term 
care facilities. The CDC estimates that every year, RSV causes approximately 60,000 –160,000 hospitalizations and 
6,000–10,000 deaths among older adults. (557,558)  
Other vaccines 
In adults with COPD t he CDC recommends the Tdap vaccination (also called dTaP/dTPa) to protect against pertussis 
(whooping cough), tetanus and diphtheria, in those who were not vaccinated in adolescence and also the routine use 
of shingles vaccine .(559,560) People with COPD should have  the COVID-19 vaccinations in line with national 
recommendations.(561) 
 
PHARMACOLOGIC AL TREATMENT OF  STABLE COPD  
We propose a tailored approach to initiate treatment based on the level of symptoms and risk for exacerbations. 
Treatment can be escalated/de -escalated based on the presence of the predominant symptoms (treatable traits) of 
breathlessness and exercise limi tation, and the continued occurrence of exacerbations whilst on maintenance therapy. 
The basis for these recommendations, which propose an organized approach to treatment, was partly derived from 
evidence generated from randomized controlled trials. Howeve r, as these recommendations are intended to support 
clinician decision-making, they also incorporate expert advice based on clinical experience.

 Initial pharmacotherapy should be based on the patient’s GOLD group ( Figure 3.7).  Patients should be offered 
guidance and follow up on self-management of breathlessness, and stress management, and they should be given a 
written action plan (Figure 3.13).  Comorbidities should also be managed as per specific guidelines, irrespective of the 
presence of COPD (Figure 3.2). 
 
Patients should be reviewed after a suitable interval (shorter in more severe patients and longer in less severe patients) 
and their current level of symptoms (using either the CAT or mMRC scores) and exacerbation frequency assessed.  The 
effect of treatment and possible adverse effects should be evaluated, and comorbidities reassessed.  
 
Inhaler technique, adherence to prescribed therapy (both pharmacological and non -pharmacological), smoking status 
and continued exposure to risk factors should be checked at each clinical visit. Physical activity should be encouraged 
and referral for pulmo nary rehabilitation considered in severe patients.  The need for oxygen therapy, non -invasive 
ventilatory support, lung volume reduction and palliative approaches should also be considered individually , and the 
action plan should be updated accordingly.  S pirometry should be repeated at least annually. If the patient is already 
receiving bronchodilator treatment, the latter should not be interrupted for performing spirometry.  
 
We no longer refer to asthma and COPD overlap (ACO), instead we emphasize that asthma and COPD are different 
disorders, although they may share some common treatable traits and clinical features (e.g., eosinophilia, some degree 
of reversibility). Asthma and COPD may coexist in an individual patient. If a concurrent diagnosis of asthma is 
suspected, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines.

 Algorithms for the initiation and follow -up of 
pharmacological treatment  
Further information on the evidence that underpins these recommendations is given later in Chapter 3 in the section 
entitled “Overview of the evidence: Pharmacotherapy ”. 
 
Initial pharmacological management  
A proposal for the INITIATION of pharmacological management of COPD according to the individualized assessment 
of symptoms and exacerbation risk following the AB E scheme, and also accounting for blood eosinophil count,  is shown 
in Figure 3.7. It is an attempt to provide clinical guidance. There is no high-quality evidence such as randomized 
controlled trials to support initial pharmacological treatment strategies in newly diagnosed COPD patients.   
 
Group A 
► All Group A patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment based on its effect on breathlessness. This can be 
either a short- or a long-acting bronchodilator.  If available and affordable a long -acting bronchodilator is the preferred 
choice except in patients with very occasional breathlessness.  
 
► This should be continued if benefit is documented.  
 
Group B 
► Treatment should be initiated with a LA BA+LAMA combination. It has been shown in a RCT that in patients with ≤ 1 
moderate exacerbation in the year before the study and a CAT™ ≥ 10 LABA+LAMA is superior to a LAMA with regard 
to several endpoints .(562) Therefore, providing there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side -effects 
LABA+LAMA is the recommended initial pharmacological  choice.   
 
► If a LABA+LAMA combination is not considered appropriate,  there is no evidence to recommend one class of long -
acting bronchodilators over another  (LABA or LAMA) for initial relief of symptoms in this group of patients. In the 
individual patient, the choice should depend on the patient’s perception of symptom relief.  
 
► Group B patients are likely to have comorbidities that may add to their symptomatology and impact their prognosis , 
and these possibilities should be investigated and treated, if present, by following national and international 
guidelines.(563,564)  
 
Group E 
► A Cochrane systematic review and network meta -analysis comparing dual combination therapy versus mono long -
acting bronchodilators showed that the LABA +LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment group to reduce 
COPD exacerbations .(565) Therefore, provided there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side -effects 
LABA+LAMA is the preferred choice  for initial therapy in group E patients. 
 
► Use of LABA+ICS in COPD  is not encouraged. If there is an indication for an ICS , then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been 
shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice .(448,566) 
 
► Consider LABA+LAMA+ICS in group E if eos ≥ 300 cells/µ L (practical recommendation). As detailed later in this 
chapter, the effect of ICS on exacerbation prevention is correlated to blood eosinophil count. There are no direct data 
in the literature concerning initiation of triple therapy in newly diagnosed patients. However, we think available studies 
performed mostly in treated patients provide a rationale for considering this treatment option as initial therapy for

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   50 
 patients with a high eosinophil count (≥  300 cells/μL). 
 
► If patients with COPD have concomitant asthma they should be treated like patients with asthma. Under these 
circumstances the use of an ICS is mandatory.   
 
Rescue short-acting bronchodilators should be prescribed to all patients for immediate symptom relief.  
 
Following implementation of therapy, patients should be reassessed for attainment of treatment goals and 
identification of any bar riers for successful treatment ( Figure 3.8). Following review of the patient ’s response to 
treatment initiation, adjustments may be needed.  
 
This is guided by the principles of first review and assess, then adjust if necessary (Figure 3.8): 
 
► Review  
▪ Review symptoms (dyspnea) and exacerbation risk (previous history, blood eosinophils).  
► Assess  
▪ Assess inhaler technique and adherence, and the role of non -pharmacological approaches (covered earlier 
in this chapter).  
► Adjust  
▪ Adjust pharmacological treatment, including escalation or de -escalation. Switching inhaler device or 
molecules within the same class (e.g., using a different long-acting bronchodilator) may be considered as 
appropriate. Any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side 
effects.

 Follow-up pharmacological management  
A separate algorithm is provided for FOLLOW-UP treatment, where the management is based on two key treatable 
traits: persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of  exacerbations (Figure 3.9). These follow-up recommendations are 
designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment 
or after years of follow -up. These recommendations incorporate the evidence from clinical trials and the use of 
peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide th e use of ICS therapy for exacerbation prevention (see 
more detailed information regarding blood eosinophil counts as a predictor of ICS effects later in Chapter 3).  
 
 
 
Figure 3.9 presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data. The 
response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed. Patients, in whom treatment modification is considered, 
in particular de-escalation, should be under close medical supervision. We are fully aware that treatment escalation 
has not been systematically tested; trials of de -escalation are also limited and only include ICS.

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   52 
 The follow-up pharmacological treatment algorithm ( Figure 3.9) can be applied to any patient who is already taking 
maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The need to target 
primarily dyspnea/activity limitation or to prevent further exacerbations should be evaluate d in each patient. If a 
change in treatment is considered necessary, then select the corresponding algorithm for dyspnea (Figure 3.9 left 
column) or exacerbations ( Figure 3.9 right column); the exacerbation algorithm should also be used for patients who 
require a change in treatment for both dyspnea and exacerbations. Identify which box corresponds to the patient’s  
current treatment and follow the suggested algorithm . 
 
Dyspnea  
► For patients with persistent breathlessness or exercise limitation on  bronchodilator monotherapy,(567) the use of 
two long acting bronchodilators is recommended.  
▪ If the addition of a second long acting bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, we suggest 
considering switching inhaler device or molecules.  
► At all stages, dyspnea due to other causes (not COPD) should be investigated and treated appropriately. Inhaler 
technique and adherence should be considered as causes of inadequate treatment response. Rehabilitation should 
also be considered. 
 
Exacerbations 
► For patients with persistent exacerbations on bronchodilator monotherapy, escalation to LABA +LAMA is 
recommended.  
 
► In patients who develop further exacerbations on LABA+LAMA therapy we suggest escalation to LABA+LAMA+ICS. 
A beneficial response after the addition of ICS may be observed at blood eosinophil counts ≥ 100 cells/µL, with a 
greater magnitude of response more likely with higher eosinophil counts. (448) 
 
► If patients treated with LABA+LAMA+ICS (or those with eos < 100 cells/µL) still have exacerbations the following 
options may be considered :  
▪ Add roflumilast. This may be considered in patients with an FEV1 < 50% predicted and chronic 
bronchitis,(568) particularly if they have experienced at least one hospitalization for an exacerbation in the 
previous year.(569,570) 
▪ Add a macrolide. The best available evidence exists for the use of azithromycin, especially in those who 
are not current smokers. (571,572) Consideration to the development of resistant organisms should be 
factored into decision -making. 
▪ Withdrawing ICS can be considered if pneumonia or other considerable side -effects develop. If blood 
eosinophils are ≥ 300 cells/µL de-escalation is more likely to be associated with the development of 
exacerbations.(573,574) Carefully consider the dose of ICS used to reduce the potential of ICS related side 
effects that are more frequent at higher doses.  
Patients under treatment with LABA+ICS  
► If a patient with COPD and no features of asthma  has been treated – for whatever reason – with LABA+ICS and is 
well controlled in terms of symptoms and exacerbations, continuation with LABA+ICS is an option. However, if the 
patient has:  
▪ Further exacerbations : treatment should be escalated to LABA+LAMA+ICS  if the blood eosinophil count 
is ≥ 100 cells/µL or switched to LABA+LAMA if it is < 100 cells/µL . 
▪ Major symptoms: switching to LABA+LAMA should be considered.

 Managing inhaled therapy  
Most of the drugs used to treat COPD are inhaled. Thus, appropriate use of inhaler devices is crucial to optimize the 
benefit-risk ratio of inhaled therapy. Achieving this goal requires choosing the appropriate device, provid ing education, 
checking inhaler use regularly and , whenever necessary , adapting education and device ( Figure 3.10). 
 
 
 
There are currently at least 33 different inhaled therapies containing different bronchodilators (both short - and long-
acting) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or in combinations ( Figure 3.18).  In addition, at least 22 different inhaler 
devices are available ,(575) including nebulizers, metered -dose inhalers (MDIs) used with or without valved holding 
chamber (VHC)/spacers, breath -actuated MDIs (BAIs), soft mist  inhalers (SMIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) (576) In 
multi-dose DPIs, the powder is contained in a reservoir or in individual blisters. (576) More information about inhalation 
devices is available on the Asthma + Lung UK website. (577) 
 
Devices differ in their size and portability.  They also differ in the number of steps required to prepare them ,(578) in the 
force needed to load or actuate them ,(579) in the time taken to deliver the drug, and in the need for cleaning and 
maintenance, as well as in the inspiratory manoeuvre required to use them effectively .(576) Increased steps reduces 
the ease of use and likelihood that patients use the inhaler correctly .(580) There may also be quite significant differences 
in the carbon footprint of devices reflecting whether or not they contain a propellant gas, what they are made from, 
how they are manufactured and transported, and whether they can be reused or recycled. (581) The proper use of an 
inhaler has a positive environmental impact through the reduction of exacerbations and their CO 2 footprint (especially 
when hospitalization is required). (581) Smart inhalers incorporate sensors that detect the date and time of use, and for 
some inspiratory flow and inspired volume. These allow the identification of problems and feedback in real time (582) 
and can provide objective data on adherence and technique .(583,584) 
 
Particles > 5 microns (µm) are most likely to be deposited in the oropharynx. For drug delivery to the lower respiratory 
tract and lungs, particle size (mass -median aerodynamic diameter) can be fine (2 -5 µm) or extra-fine (< 2 µm), which 
influences the total respirable fraction (particles < 5 µm) and the amount and site of drug deposition (m ore peripheral 
deposition with extra -fine particles).(576) Inspiratory flow, flow acceleration, and inhaled volume are important factors 
for patients to successfully inhale drug particles from handheld devices into the lower respiratory tract. (576,585) MDIs 
and SMIs require a slow and deep inspiration while DPIs require forceful inspiration. Each DPI has a unique internal 
resistance and patients must create turbulent energy within the device during inhalation to disaggregate the powder 
into fine particles.  Prescribers should check visually that the patient can inhale forcefully through the device and, i f

 there is doubt, either check the inspiratory flow objectively (586,587) or switch to an MDI+/ -spacer/VHC or SMI depending 
on drug availability and patient’s characteristics.  Suboptimal peak inspiratory flow and inhalation technique errors 
were associated with higher COPD -related healthcare utilization and costs in patients on DPI maintenance therapy. (588) 
 
Randomized controlled trials have not identified superiority of one device/formulation and there is no evidence for 
superiority of nebulized therapy over hand -held devices in patients who are able to use these devices properly .(576) 
However, patients included in these trials are usually those who master inhalation technique and receive proper 
education and follow -up regarding this issue, and therefore may not be reflective of normal clinical practice. Fixed -
dose triple inhaled combina tion therapy in one inhaler may help improve health status compared to treatment using 
multiple inhalers.(589) 
 
Ability to use delivery system correctly  
Specific instructions are available for each type of device .(576,577) On average more than two thirds of patients make at 
least one error in using an inhalational device. (590-593) Observational studies in these patients show that, although the 
type and frequency of inhalation errors vary between devices depending on their characteristics, there is no dev ice 
obviating the need to explain, demonstrate and regularly check inhalation technique .(594-600) The main errors in delivery 
device use relate to problems with inspiratory flow , inhalation duration, coordination, dose preparation, exhalation 
maneuver prior to inhalation and breath -holding following dose inhalation. (601) 
 
Patients’ ability to use inhalers correctly is affected by their cognitive ability, manual dexterity and coordination skills,  
the inspiratory flow that they can achieve, the use of different types of device, and previous education on inhaler 
technique.(591,602) Poor inhaler technique and errors using devices are more common with advancing age ,(603) but this 
is likely to be mainly due to cofounders such as cognitive impairment or reduced manual dexterity .(604,605) pMDIs 
require sufficient hand strength to actuate the inhaler, and although BAIs are triggered by inhalation they still require 
priming which needs a degree of strength .(579) Patients with poor dexterity may struggle to load a DPI, particularly if 
capsules require extraction from foil, insertion into the device or puncturing prior to administration .(579)  Tremor may 
result in shaking of the device and loss of the dose .(606) 
 
If there is any doubt that the patient will not be able to use a pMDI correctly they should be prescribed a VHC/spacer; 
however, these are not a panacea and there is evidence that incorrect use of pMDIs is more common in older patients 
if they use a VHC.(607)  Currently available VHC s range in volume from <  50 to 750 mL(608)  but VHC with volumes from 
150 to 250 mL have been shown to be as effective as those with larger volumes (609) and are more portable.  As well as 
reducing difficulties caused by poor co -ordination and inspiratory ma neuvers with pMDIs, VHCs increase pulmonary 
and reduce oropharyngeal deposition, which is particularly important to minimi ze the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis 
with corticosteroid containing pMDIs. (576) 
 
Leaflets included in device packages are insufficient to provide proper education of patients regarding inhaler use. 
Other strategies and tools including physical training and use of video or web -based education have proven effective 
to improve inhaler tec hnique in some but not all patients on the short -term, but effects appear to wane over time .(580) 
Using the “teach-back” approach (patients being asked to show how the device has to be used)  appears to be 
particularly effective. (610) Pharmacist-, physician-, physiotherapist- and nurse-led  interventions(611) as well as lay health 
coaching(612) can improve inhalation technique and adherence in COPD patients.  As in asthma, digital inhalers could 
contribute to improve d adherence and inhaler technique in patients with COPD .(613) 
 
Choice of inhaler device  
If a patient is currently taking inhaled therapy and able to use their current device correctly, new therapy is best 
prescribed in the same device.  If a new device is required, either because the patient is not using their current device 
correctly or the drug is not available in the same device, a systematic iterative process should be used to select a

 delivery system and ensure the patient can use it.  
 
The choice of an inhaler device depends on drug availability, characteristics of the device, the patient’s abilities and 
preferences, and the knowledge of healthcare professionals caring for the patient about devices and their correct 
usage. The final choi ce should be made jointly by the prescriber and the patient using a shared decision -making 
approach.  Figure 3.11 summarises the main principles that should be considered to guide the individualized selection 
of the appropriate device for a given patient.  
 
 
 
Appropriate education must be provided by health care professionals, including physical, video - or be-based 
demonstration of the proper technique and live verification that the patient masters this technique. It is crucial to 
check regularly (ideally, at each visit) that patients continue to use their device correctly. Lack of placebo devices within  
clinical areas is often a limitation and barrier to providing quality inhaler technique instruction to patients. Encour aging 
a patient to bring their own devices to clinic is a useful alternative.

 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF STABLE COPD  
Non-pharmacological treatment is complementary to pharmacological treatment and should form part of the 
comprehensive management of COPD.  
 
After receiving a diagnosis of COPD a patient should be given further information about the condition. Physicians 
should emphasize the importance of a smoke free environment, empower adherence to prescribed medication, 
ensure proper inhaler technique, prom ote physical activity, prescribe vaccinations, and refer patients to pulmonary 
rehabilitation.  
 
Algorithms for the initiation and follow -up of non-
pharmacological treatment  
Some relevant non -pharmacological measures based on the patient’s GOLD A,B,E group AT DIAGNOSIS are 
summarized in Figure 3.12.

 Recommendations for FOLLOW UP non-pharmacological treatments are based on a patient’s treatable traits e.g., 
symptoms and exacerbations ( Figure 3.13). 
 
 
Rehabilitation , Education & Self-Management  
Pulmonary rehabilitation  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is defined as “a comprehensive intervention based on thorough patient assessment followed 
by patient-tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, self -management 
intervention aiming at behavior change, designed to improve the phy sical and psychological condition of people with 
chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long -term adherence to health -enhancing behaviors. ”(614)  
 
Patients with high symptom burden and risk of exacerbations (Groups B and E), should be encouraged to take part in 
a formal rehabilitation program  that includes setting patient goals  and is designed and delivered in a structured 
manner, taking into account the individual’s COPD characteristics and comorbidities .(614-616) This includes patients who 
are older, female, more deprived, or have a comorbidity of diabetes, asthma, or painful condition and currently appear 
less likely to be referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. (617)

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   58 
 Pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered as part of integrated patient management, and usually includes a range 
of healthcare professionals to ensure optimum coverage of the many aspects involved. (615) Optimum benefits are 
achieved from programs lasting 6 to 8 weeks. Available evidence indicates that there are no additional benefits from 
extending pulmonary rehabilitation to 12 weeks. (618) Supervised exercise training at least twice weekly is 
recommended, and this can include any regimen from endurance training, interval training, resistance/strength 
training; upper and lower limbs ideally should be included as well as walking exercise; fle xibility, inspiratory muscle 
training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation can also be incorporated. In all cases the rehabilitation intervention 
(content, scope, frequency, and intensity) should be individualized to maximize personal functional gains. (618) When 
the intervention includes ongoing feedback (telephone calls, biofeedback provided via pedometer and progressive 
goal setting) but the program is not supervised, it is no more effective in improving physical activity than a walking 
program with no fee dback.(619) The importance of long -term behavior change to improve physical functionality, and 
reduce the psychological impact of COPD, should be emphasized to the patient.  
 
Assessment and follow-up of pulmonary rehabilitation  
Baseline and outcome assessments of each participant in a pulmonary rehabilitation program should be made to 
specify individual maladaptive behaviors (including motivation), physical and mental health impediments to training, 
goals, barriers and capabiliti es and to quantify gains and to target areas for improvement.  
 
Assessments should include:  
 
► Detailed history and physical examination  
► Measurement of post -bronchodilator spirometry  
► Assessment of exercise capacity 
► Measurement of health status and impact of breathlessness  
► Assessment of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength and lower limb strength in patients who suffer 
from muscle wasting  
► Discussion about individual patient goals and expectations  
 
The first two assessments are important for establishing entry suitability and baseline status but are not used in 
outcome assessment.  
 
Exercise tolerance can be assessed by cycle ergometry or treadmill exercise with the measurement of a number of 
physiological variables, including maximum oxygen consumption, maximum heart rate, and maximum work 
performed. Standardized self -paced, timed walking tests (e.g., 6-minute walking distance) are useful in clinical practice 
as they require minimal facilities and are relevant to routine functioning. Shuttle walking tests provide more complete 
information than an entirely self -paced test, and are simp ler to perform than a treadmill test. (620) Walking tests do 
require at least one practice session before data can be interpreted.  
 
It is important not to limit assessment only to these outcome measures but gather information on each patient ’s 
ultimate goal (relevant or valued outcomes), such as their desired achievements in work, home and leisure by the end 
of the program. 
 
Several detailed questionnaires for assessing health status are available, including some specifically designed for 
patients with respiratory disease. Health status can also be assessed by generic instruments, although these are less 
sensitive to change th an the disease specific questionnaires such as the CAT ™, CRQ or SGRQ. The Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) (621) and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME -MD) Patient 
Questionnaire(622) have been used to improve identification and treatment of anxious and depressed patients.

 Education, self-management and integrative care  
Patient “education” often takes the form of providers giving information and advice, and assumes that  knowledge will 
lead to behavior change. Although enhancing patient knowledge is an important step towards behavior change, 
didactic group sessions are insufficient for promoting self -management skills. Topics such as smoking cessation, 
correct use of inhaler devices, early recognition of exacerb ation, decision-making and taking action, and when to seek 
help, surgical interventions, considering advance direc tives, and others will be better dealt with using self -
management interventions. Personalized education and training that considers specific issues relating to the individual 
patients, and that aims to enhance long -term functionality and appropriate health behaviors , is likely to benefit 
patients more. These are addressed under self -management. 
 
Education 
Patients may have individual and/or group education sessions. During group sessions, patients engage in active, 
participatory-based learning of program content. During one -on-one interactions, a motivational communication style 
should be used, as this approach empowers patients to take greater responsibility for their health and wellbeing, 
where physicians and other healthcare professionals only serve as guides in the behavior change process.  
 
Topics considered appropriate for an education program include: smoking cessation; basic information about COPD; 
general approach to therapy and specific aspects of medical treatment (respiratory medications and inhalation 
devices); strategies to help mini mize dyspnea; advice about when to seek help; decision -making during exacerbations; 
and advance directives and end -of-life issues. The intensity and content of these educational messages will vary 
depending on the severity of the patient’s disease, althoug h the specific contributions of education to the 
improvements seen after pulmonary rehabilitation remain unclear. (623)  Implicit in this description is the provision of 
“self-management support/coaching”, which refers to the strategies, techniques and skills used by healthcare 
providers to arm patients with the knowledge, confidence and skills required to self -manage their disease effectively. 
However, the individual patient’s evaluation and risk assessment with respect to exacerbations, patient’s needs, 
preferences, and personal goals should inform the personalized design of the self-management education plan . 
 
Self-management 
Self-management education and coaching by healthcare professionals should be  a major component of the “Chronic 
Care Model” within the context of the health care delivery system.  
 
The aim of self-management interventions  is to motivate, engage and coach patients to positively adapt their health 
behavior(s) and develop skills to better manage their COPD on a day-to-day basis.(624) Physicians and healthcare 
providers need to go beyond pure education/advice -giving (didactic) approaches to help patients learn and adopt 
sustainable self-management skills. The basis of enabling patients to become active partners in their ongoing care is 
to build knowledge and skills. It is important to recognize that patient education alone does not itself change behavior 
or even motivate patients, and it has had no impact o n improving exercise performance or lung function, (625,626) but it 
can play a role in improving skills, ability to cope with illness, and health status. (614)  
 
Integrative care 
COPD is a complex disease that requires the input of multiple care providers who need to work together closely. In 
principle, use of a formal structured program that determines how each component is delivered should make care 
more efficient and effective, but the evidence for this is divided.

 Oxygen therapy and ventilatory support  
Oxygen therapy  
The long-term administration of oxygen (> 15 hours per day) to patients with chronic respiratory failure has been 
shown to increase survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia .(627) Long-term oxygen therapy does not lengthen 
time to death or first hospitalization or provide sustained benefit for any of the measured outcomes in patients with 
stable COPD and resting or exercise -induced moderate arterial oxygen desaturation. (628) Breathlessness may be 
relieved in COPD patients who are either mildly hypoxemic, or non-hypoxemic but do not otherwise qualify for home 
oxygen therapy, when oxygen is given during exercise training; however, studies have shown  no improvement of 
breathlessness in daily life and no benefit on health related quality of life  (Figure 3.14).(628-630) There are contradictory 
studies although the majority do not demonstrate changes. (631) 
 
 
Although air travel is safe for most patients with chronic respiratory failure who are on long -term oxygen therapy ,(632) 
patients should ideally maintain an in -flight PaO2 of at least 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). Studies indicate that this can be 
achieved in those with moderate to severe hypoxemia at sea level by supplementary oxygen at 3 liters/min by nasal 
cannula or 31% by Venturi facemask .(633) Those with a resting oxygen saturation > 95% and 6 -minute walk oxygen 
saturation > 84% may travel without further assessment, (634) although it is important to emphasize that resting 
oxygenation at sea level does not exclude the development of severe hypoxemia when travelling by air .(632) Careful 
consideration should be given to any comorbidity that may impair oxygen delivery to tissues (e .g., cardiac impairment, 
anemia). Also, walking along the aisle may profoundly aggravate hypoxemia .(635)

 Long-term oxygen therapy  (LTOT) is indicated for stable patients who have: 
► PaO2 at or below 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa) or SaO2 at or below 88%, with or without hypercapnia confirmed 
twice over a three-week period; or 
► PaO2 between 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa) and 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), or SaO2 of 88%, if there is evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension, peripheral edema  suggesting congestive cardiac failure, or polycythemia (hematocrit > 
55%). 
 
Once placed on LTOT the patient should be re-evaluated after 60 to 90 days with repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) or 
oxygen saturation measurements while inspiring room air and the level of oxygen flow that had been prescribed to 
determine if oxygen is still indicated and if so, therapeutic. An appropriate algorithm for the prescription of oxygen to 
COPD patients is shown in Figure 3.15. 
 
 
Ventilatory support  
Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) is occasionally used in patients with stable very severe COPD. (636) NIV may be considered 
of some use in a selected group of patients, particularly in those with pronounced daytime hypercapnia and recent 
hospitalization, although  a systematic review was unable to support or refute this. (637) In contrast, in patients with both 
COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear indications for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). (638,639)  
 
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   62 
 During exacerbations of COPD  
NIV in the form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is the standard of care for decreasing morbidity 
and mortality in patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COP D and acute respiratory failure (640-643) (see also 
Chapter 4). 
 
Stable patient 
In patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear benefits associated with the use of continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) to improve both survival and the risk of hospital admissions. (638,639)  
 
Whether to use NPPV chronically at home to treat patients with acute on chronic respiratory failure following 
hospitalization remains un determined and outcome may be affected by persistent hypercapnia .(644) A multicenter 
prospective RCT of COPD patients with persistent hypercapnia (PaCO 2 > 53 mmHg) after 2-4 weeks of hospital 
discharge because an acute episode of exacerbation , compared the effects of home NIV plus oxygen compared to 
home oxygen alone on time to readmission or death .(644) Results showed that adding home NIV to oxygen therapy 
significantly prolonged the time to readmission or death within 12 months .(644) A systematic review and meta -analysis 
of these studies confirms that NIV decreases mortality and risk of hospitalization. The best candidate subgroups (by 
recent hospitalization history or PaCO 2) remain unclear.(643) 
 
Two previous retrospective studies (645,646) and two of three RCTs (644,647-650) reported reductions in re-hospitalization and 
improved survival with using NPPV post-hospitalization. Two studies reported decreases in mortality and 
hospitalization rates while another showed no benefit of NPPV for survival.(648) Several factors may account for 
discrepancies: differences in patient selection, underpowered studies, NPPV settings incapable of achieving adequate 
ventilation, and poor adherence with NPPV therapy. (651) NPPV when indicated should be instituted and monitored 
under the direction of personnel familiar with the process and the devices utilized .(652,653) 
 
MONITORING AND FOLLOW -UP 
Routine follow-up of COPD patients is essential. Lung function may worsen over time, even with the best available 
care. Symptoms, exacerbations  and objective measures of airflow obstruction should be monitored to determine 
when to modify management and to identify any complications and/or comorbidities that may develop.  
 
Symptoms  
At each visit, information on symptoms since the last visit should be collected , including cough and sputum, 
breathlessness, fatigue, activity limitation, and sleep disturbances , including insomnia . Questionnaires such as the 
COPD Assessment Test (CAT™)(428) can be used; trends and changes are more valuable than single measurements.  
 
Exacerbations 
The frequency, severity, type and likely causes of all exacerbations(654) should be monitored . Sputum volume and 
presence or absence of sputum purulence  should be noted. Specific inquiry into response to previous treatment, 
unscheduled visits to providers, telephone calls for assistance, and use of urgent or emergency care facilities is 
important. Hospitalizations should be documented, including the facility, duration of stay, and any use of critical care 
or mechanical ventilatory support.  
 
Adherence and appropriate use of prescribed treatments  
This is a key action in the chronic management of COPD patients that should be mandatory in each clinical visit.  The 
following aspects need careful and personalized attention:  
 
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   63 
 ► Dosages of prescribed medications  
► Adherence to the regimen  
► Inhaler technique 
► Effectiveness of the current regime  
► Side effects 
 
Treatment modifications should be recommended (Figure 3.7). 
 
Smoking status 
At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure  should be determined followed by appropriate action.  
 
Measurements 
Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) to identify patients who are 
declining quickly, although other lung function parameters reflecting hyperinflation and gas transfer may also be 
informative. 
 
A timed walking test (6 -minute walking distance or shuttle -walking test) provides additional information regarding 
prognosis.(655,656) Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who 
will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia.  
 
Imaging 
If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated.  When exacerbations are repeatedly characterized 
by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis.  
 
Comorbidities 
Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition such as lung cancer, obstructive 
sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, osteoporosis or depression/anxiety etc. should be 
recorded. If present, an appro priate diagnostic work -up should follow (see also Chapter 5). 
Telehealth and remote monitoring  
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how outpatient care is delivered in health care practices. Telehealth 
may offer a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to consider virtual and hybrid virtual/in -person care models, with 
a goal of improved h ealthcare access, outcomes, and affordability. However, incorporat ion of virtual care into 
ambulatory care should be based on evidence.  
 
From a recent Cochrane review (657) on telehealth for remote monitoring and consultations for patients with COPD, 
different models have been reviewed based on RCTs:  
 
► Remote monitoring (linked to a healthcare professional) plus usual care versus usual care alone (as 
reported by trialists).  
► Remote consultation (e.g., real -time contact with a health professional) plus usual care versus usual care 
alone (e.g., face-to- face visit for a check -up in a health service with a health professional, or as reported 
by trialists).  
► Remote monitoring or remote consultation versus usual care (e.g., where tele healthcare has replaced an 
element of usual face -to-face care). 
 
For most of the studies included in the review (24 RCTs) remote monitoring interventions requir ed participants to

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   64 
 transfer measurements using a remote device for subsequent health professional review (asynchronous) as opposed 
to only 5 RCTs that transferred data and allowed review by health professionals in real time (synchronous). (657) The 
results of this systematic review demonstrate the paucity of evidence of superiority of these models compared to 
usual care, i.e., exacerbations, hospitalization, health status and mortality. While there was no evidence of harm, it is 
still unclear which COPD severity subgroups would benefit , or possibly be harmed,  by telehealth interventions. 
Telehealth interventions may be beneficial as an additional health resource based on professional assessment , and 
depending on individual needs,  although the long-term effects remain unknown.  
 
SUPPORTIVE, PALLIATIVE, END -OF-LIFE & HOSPICE CARE  
Symptom control and palliative care  
Palliative care is a broad term that encompasses approaches to symptom control as well as management of terminal 
patients close to death. The goal of palliative care is to prevent and relieve suffering, and to support the best possible 
quality of life for patients and their families, regardless of the stage of disease or the need for other therapies .(658) 
COPD is a highly symptomatic disease and has many elements such as fatigue, dyspnea, depression, anxiety, insomnia 
that require symptom -based palliative treatments. There is evidence that people with COPD  are less likely to receive 
such services compared to patients with lung cancer .(659,660) Palliative care expands traditional disease -model medical 
treatment to increase the focus on the goals of enhancing quality of life, optimizing function, helping with decision -
making about end-of-life care, and providing emotional and spiritual support to patients and their families .(658) 
Palliative approaches  are essential in the context of  end-of-life care as well as hospice care (a model for delivery of 
end-of-life care for patients who are terminally ill and predicted to have less than 6 months to live).  Increasingly, 
palliative care teams are available for consultation for hospitalized patients .(661) Availability for outpatient palliative 
care consultation is less common, and has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce symptoms and even prolong 
survival for patients with advanced lung cancer .(660) Key points for palliative, end -of-life and hospice care in COPD are 
summarized in Figure 3.16.

 Therapy relevant to all people with COPD  
Even when receiving optimal medical therapy many people with COPD continue to experience distressing 
breathlessness, impaired exercise capacity, fatigue, and suffer panic, anxiety and depression.(662) Some of these 
symptoms can be improved by wider use of palliative therapies that in the past have often been restricted to end -of-
life situations. 
 
Palliative treatment of dyspnea  
Relieving dyspnea during daily life activities to limit disability, improve quality of life , and reduce medical resource use 
is a major goal of COPD care. Multiple therapeutic approaches can be considered to target the variety of involved 
mechanisms; they are dominated by inhaled bronchodilators, self -management education  (where patients learn 
breathing techniques ) and pulmonary rehabilitation that includes exercise training. The roles of oxygen therapy, high -
flow nasal therapy (HFNT) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for palliation of dyspnea are debated. (663)  
 
Opiates,(664-666) neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), (666,667) chest wall vibration (CWV) (666) and fans blowing air 
onto the face(666,668,669) can relieve breathlessness. Morphine may improve health status in COPD patients. (317) 
Immediate-release morphine extended exercise endurance time in over half of  the patients with advanced COPD  in 
one study.(317) However, in another RCT oral extended -release morphine (8 mg/day or 16 mg/day  for one week) did 
not improve dyspnea compared with placebo in patients with mMRC breathlessness scale score s of 3 or 4.(670) Further 
research is required to determine what patient characteristics predict response  to opioid therapy.(671) The optimal 
formulation and administration route remain under d iscussion.(666,672)    
 
Oxygen may offer some benefit even if the patient is not hypoxemic (Sp0 2 > 92%) (Figure 3.14).(673) Pulmonary 
rehabilitation is effective and in severe cases NIV can also reduce daytime breathlessness. Acupuncture and 
acupressure are other non-pharmacological approach es in patients with advanced COPD that may improve 
breathlessness and quality of life. (674) Refractory dyspnea may be more effectively managed with a multidisciplinary 
integrated palliative and respiratory care service .(675)  
 
There is no evidence for a beneficial effect of benzodiazepines (676) and there is not enough data to recommend 
distractive auditory stimuli (music), relaxation, counseling and support, with or without breathing  relaxation training, 
or psychotherapy.(677) 
 
Nutritional support  
Low BMI and particularly low fat -free mass is associated with worse outcomes in people with COPD. (678) In 
malnourished people with COPD, nutritional supplementation promotes significant weight gain and leads to significant 
improvements in respiratory muscle strength and overall health -related quality of life .(679) Nutritional antioxidant 
supplementation (vitamin C and E, zinc, and selenium) has been shown to improve antioxidant deficits, quadriceps 
strength, and serum total protein, without further improvement in quadriceps endurance.  Only in malnourished 
patients has nutritional supplementation demonstrated significant improvements for 6 -minute walk test, respiratory 
muscle strength and health status. (680) A 12-month nutritional intervention in muscle wasted patients had no effect on 
physical capacity but physical activity was significantly higher. (681) 
 
Panic, anxiety & depression 
The causes of depression and anxiety symptoms in people with COPD are multifactorial and include behavioral, social 
and biological factors .(682) Pulmonary rehabilitation may help reduce anxiety symptoms. The efficacy of 
antidepressants in people with COPD has been inconclusive , possibly as a result of methodological issues  in the 
published trials. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mind -body interventions (e .g., mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, 
and relaxation) can reduce anxiety and depression ; mind-body interventions also improve physical outcomes such as

 lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity and fatigue in people with COPD and psychological problems .(683) 
 
Fatigue 
Fatigue in people with COPD can be improved by self -management education, pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional 
support and mind-body interventions.(684) 
End-of-life and hospice care  
In many patients, the disease trajectory in COPD is marked by a gradual decline in health status and increasing 
symptoms, punctuated by acute exacerbations that are associated with an increased risk of dying .(685) Although 
mortality rates following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD are declining,(686) reported rates still vary 
from 23%(687) to 80%.(688) Progressive respiratory failure, cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and other diseases are 
the primary cause of death in people with COPD hospitalized for an exacerbation .(688) In qualitative studies, as well as 
describing the high symptom burden, people with COPD and their families describe a need for a better understanding 
of their condition and the psychological impact of living and dying with COPD .(689) Palliative care is a broad term that 
includes approaches to symptom control as well as management of terminal patients close to death.  Palliative care, 
end-of-life care, and hospice care are important components of the care of patients with advanced COPD.  
 
End-of-life care should also include discussions with patients and their families about their views on resuscitation, 
advance directives and place of death preferences .(690) At an individual level, prediction of 6 -month survival in people 
with COPD is unreliable and therefore early discussion of these issues is important together with phased introduction 
of supportive care.(691) Hospitalization may be a trigger to initiate discussion of advance care planning. Patients and 
their families live with uncertainty about the timing of death and fear of death will result from worsening dyspnea and 
suffocation.(692) Good advance care planning can reduce anxiety for patients and their families by talking about death 
and dying and offering emotional support.  It can also ensure that care is consistent with their wishes and avoids 
unnecessary, unwanted and costly invasive approaches .(693,694) 
 
For patients with very advanced or terminal illness, hospice services may provide additional benefit. Hospice services 
often focus on patients with severe disability or symptom burden and may provide these services within the patient’s 
home or in hospice beds in dedicated hospice units or other institutions such as hospitals or nursing homes. 
Organizations such as t he National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (695) provide guidance for selecting patients 
with non-cancer diseases like COPD for access to hospice services (for example, disabling dyspnea at rest that is poorly 
responsive to bronchodilators and progression of advanced disease demonstrated by increasing h ospitalizations or 
emergency department visits ).(659,660) These guidelines discuss the difficulties in accurately predicting the prognosis of 
patients with advanced COPD, but recognize the appropriateness of providing hospice services for some of these 
patients.(658)  
 
Therapeutic interventions t hat reduce COPD mortality  
COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019. As we move towards targeting 
subgroups of COPD patients for specific therapy, it is important to know which modifiable factors (treatable traits) are 
associated with mortality. A large clinical database study of COPD in primary care  has demonstrated that the highest 
magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality, was in individuals with increased severity 
and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD gro ups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 
4).(696) We are still learning about the mechanisms that cause death in patients with COPD. Demonstrating benefits of 
therapeutic modalities on mortality in RCTs has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow -up 
duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow -up. In addition, 
the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mort ality (e.g., respiratory or cardiovascular) in most

 trials difficult. Figure 3.17 presents a summary of pharmacological and non -pharmacological therapies with evidence 
of efficacy in reducing the mortality of COPD patients.  
 
Pharmacological therapy  
Previous studies such as the TORCH clinical trial (697) and the SUMMIT trial (698) failed to provide evidence for the efficacy 
of a LABA+ICS combination compared to placebo in reducing mortality (primary outcome) in COPD patients. These 
trials had no requirement for a history of previous exacerbations. In the largest LAMA treatment trial UPLIFT, the 
intention to treat analysis, i.e., 30 days after completion of the study period, did not demonstrate a reduction in 
mortality (secondary outcome) compared to placebo.  The majority of patients included in this study utilized an ICS.   
 
Recently, evidence has emerged from two large randomized clinical trials, IMPACT (448) and ETHOS,(566) that fixed-dose 
inhaled triple combinations (LABA +LAMA+ICS), reduce all-cause mortality compared to dual inhaled long -acting 
bronchodilation therapy. These trials were enriched for symptomatic patients (CAT  ≥ 10) with a history of frequent ( ≥ 
2 moderate exacerbations) and/or severe exacerbations ( ≥ 1 exacerbation requiring a hospital admission)  (Figure 
3.17).

 Non-pharmacological therapy  
Smoking cessation. From the Lung Health Study, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that included asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic COPD patients treated with a 10-week smoking cessation intervention program and followed up to 14.5 
years, the overall mortality rate was reduced in the smoking cessation intervention group compared to the usual care 
group.(699) 
 
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) . A systematic review of RCTs reported a reduction in mortality for patients who had PR 
initiated during hospitalization or 4 weeks after discharge compared to those who did not have PR.(700-703)  These results 
have been corroborated by real -world evidence, from a large population -based cohort of 190,000 patients hospitalized 
for COPD, in whom initiation of PR within 90 days of discharge, while rare, was associated with  a statistically significant 
reduced mortality.(704) 
 
Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT).  Survival benefit of LTOT in COPD demonstrated in two studies in the early 1980s 
laid the foundation for long -term domiciliary management of hypoxemia. The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial 
(NOTT)(≥ 19 hours of continuous oxygen compared to ≤ 13 hours)(705) and the Medical Research Council (MRC)( ≥ 15 
hours compared to no oxygen) ,(706) two RCTs in COPD patients with resting PaO 2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg with cor 
pulmonale or secondary polycythemia showed a survival benefit. No significant benefit of LTOT was found in patients 
with moderate desaturation. (707) 
 
Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).  Recent meta-analyses(643,708) have shown positive results of long -
term NPPV in patients with stable COPD. Although RCT results have being inconsistent on survival, larger trials with 
mortality as the primary outcome, enrolling patients with marked hypercapnia and applying higher IPAP levels 
demonstrated a reduction of mortality. (648,709)  
 
Lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS).  Because of the absence of randomized trials, 
observational data has been used to estimate the survival benefit of lung transplantation, relative to remaining 
“untransplanted.” The survival benefit of transplantation varied by disease group, with a 2-year expected benefit in 
2/5 of transplanted COPD patients.(710) 
 
LVRS has been shown to prolong survival compared to medical therapy in a very select group of patients with severe 
COPD, predominantly upper lobe emphysema, and low exercise capacity. (289) Among patients with non -upper-lobe 
emphysema and high exercise capacity, mortality was higher in the surgery group than in the medical -therapy group. 
 
In summary, available data suggest that several pharmacological and non -pharmacological treatments may reduce 
mortality. Further analyses or studies may help to determine whether specific patient subgroups demonstrate a 
greater survival benefit.  
Overview of the evidence: Pharmacotherapy  
Pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation  
Pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation include controller medications aimed at achieving long -term 
abstinence (nicotine patch, bupropion, and varenicline) and those that rapidly relieve acute withdrawal symptoms 
(short-acting nicotine). 
 
Nicotine replacement products 
Nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, inhaler, nasal spray, transdermal patch, sublingual tablet, or lozenge) 
reliably increases long -term smoking abstinence rates (533,535,537,711,712) and is significantly more effective than placebo.

 Nicotine replacement therapy often causes irritation at the site through which it is administered, and can cause non -
ischemic chest pain and palpitations, therefore m edical contraindications to nicotine replacement therapy include  
recent myocardial infarction or stroke .(537,713,714) The contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy after acute 
coronary syndrome remains unclear  and the evidence suggests that this  treatment can and should be started > 2 
weeks after a cardiovascular event .(715) Continuous chewing of nicotine gum produces secretions that are swallowed 
rather than absorbed through the buccal mucosa  resulting in little absorption and potentially causing nausea.  
 
Vaping/E-cigarettes 
There is a perception that vaping with electronic cigarettes (e -cigarettes, vapes) is safer than smoking and therefore 
an effective nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation.  The efficacy of vaping with regard to  smoking 
cessation remains controversial. (716-720) E-cigarettes provide a vaporized and doseable method of nicotine inhalation 
and have increased in usage as an alternative to cigarettes for those wishing to quit , but also as a rising trend in 
younger individuals who have never smoked . E-cigarettes may contain not only nicotine but also other chemicals, such 
as vegetable glycine, propylene glycol, various flavoring agents, volatile carbonyls, diacetyl, reactive oxygen species, 
furones and metals. The long -term health effects in general  smokers, but more importantly in high -risk populations 
such as COPD, are largely unknown.  
 
What is known has been reported mainly as individual , or series of, case reports of the acute effects of e -cigarettes, 
including vaping-associated lung injury. Severe acute lung injury, eosinophilic pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, 
respiratory bronchiolitis and other forms of lung abnormalities have been reportedly linked to e-cigarette use, and 
occasionally death.(721-724) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
state and other clinical and public health partners investigat ed an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use -
associated lung injury (EVALI) . By February 2020, a total of 2,807 cases of lung illness and 68 deaths had been 
associated with using e -cigarette products (devices, liquids, refill pods, and/or cartridges). (724) Patients were reported 
to have had clinical improvement with systemic glucocorticoid therapy and the majority received prolonged 
courses.(723) Laboratory data showed that vitamin E acetate, an additive in some THC -containing e-cigarettes, was 
strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak. (725) Following the identification of vitamin E acetate as a primary cause of EVALI 
there was a decline in new cases. 
 
Neutrophilic inflammation of the airways, airways irritability, ciliary paresis and increased mucus hypersecretion are 
seen in animal models and in vitro human airway studies and are similar to changes induced by cigarette smoke and 
recognised features of COPD. (726-730) These data are summarized in a review by Gotts and colleagues, (731) although it is 
likely to be many years before the long -term risks of vaping, including risks of cancer, are clarified, particularly in 
people with COPD and/or whether vaping is an independent risk factor for developing COPD. (721-724) In a large 
prospective cohort study, an  increased risk of respiratory  disease among former and current e-cigarette users was 
observed even when a djusted for cigarette and other combustible tobacco product use, demographic characteristics, 
and chronic health conditions .(732) There is additional evidence that in older adults at risk of or with COPD, e-cigarette 
users have greater nicotine dependence, poorer lung -related health outcomes (more chronic bronchitis and 
exacerbations), and are less likely to reduce or quit smoking conventional cigarettes. (733) 
 
A meta-analysis of five RCTs has suggested that e-cigarettes are superior to nicotine replacement therapy  for achieving 
6 months continuous abstinence  from smoking tobacco.(734) Nevertheless, based on the available evidence and the 
lack of knowledge about the long -term effects of e-cigarettes on respiratory health, it is not possible to recommend 
this intervention for smoking cessation in patients with COPD.  
 
Pharmacological products 
Results of a meta-analysis comparing simple controller pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, 
nortriptyline and varenicline) with placebo in smokers with COPD showed that all pharmacotherapy groups (except

 nortriptyline) increased the chances of smoking cessation compared with placebo. (527) Prolonged abstinence rates in 
the pharmacotherapy groups ranged from 14% to 27%, and in the placebo group from 5% to 9%. (527)  
 
A study in patients with COPD showed higher continuous abstinence rates during weeks 9 to 24 with varenicline 
(58.3%) and bupropion (55.6%) compared with nicotine patch (38.2%). (735) Varenicline and bupropion showed similar 
efficacy, however, the group receiving varenicline compared with bupropion smoked more cigarettes per day. (735)  
Pharmacotherapy to treat stable COPD  
Pharmacotherapy for COPD is currently focused on symptoms and exacerbations. FEV1 decline has been considered a 
surrogate for the natural course of the disease. In this context, studies have been performed to evaluate if 
pharmacotherapy may have an impact on the change of FEV1 over time. Individual clinical trials have not been 
sufficiently conclusive to show that pharmacotherapy can reduce the rate of FEV1 decline.(736-740) However, a 
systematic review combining data from 9 studies demonstrated a reduction in the rate of FEV1 decline of 5.0 mL/year 
in active treatment arms compared with placebo arms.(741) The difference between long-acting bronchodilator  
containing treatment  arms and placebo arms was 4.9 mL/year. The difference between inhaled corticosteroid  
containing treatment arms and placebo arms was 7.3 mL/year. Although we need to be aware of the potential benefit 
of pharmacotherapy in reducing the rate of lung function decline, further research is needed to  know which patients 
are likely to benefit.  
 
The classes of medications commonly used to treat COPD are shown in Figure 3.18. The choice within each class 
depends on the availabi lity and cost of medication , and the clinical response balanced against side effects . Each 
treatment regimen needs to be individualized as the relationship between severity of symptoms, airflow obstruction, 
and severity of exacerbations can differ between patients . The WHO has defined a minimum set of interventions for 
the management of stable COPD in primary care .(742) 
Bronchodilators  
Bronchodilators are medications that increase FEV1 and/or change other spirometric variables  (Figure 3.19). They act 
by altering airway smooth muscle tone  and the improvements in expiratory flow reflect widening of the airways rather 
than changes in lung elastic recoil. Bronchodilators tend to reduce dynamic hyperinflation at rest and during 
exercise,(282,743) and improve exercise performance. The extent of these changes, especially in patients with severe and 
very severe COPD, is not easy to predict from the improvement in FEV1 measured at rest.(744,745) 
 
Bronchodilator dose -response (FEV1 change) curves are relatively flat with all classes of bronchodilators .(746-752) 
Increasing the dose of either a beta 2-agonist or an anticholinergic by an order of magnitude, especially when  given by 
a nebulizer, appears to p rovide subjective benefit in acute episodes (753) but is not necessarily helpful in stable 
disease.(754) Bronchodilator medications in COPD are most often given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce 
symptoms. Toxicity is also dose -related (Figure 3.18). Use of short acting bronchodilators on a regular basis  is not 
generally recommended.

Beta2-agonists 
The principal action of beta 2-agonists is to relax airway smooth muscle by stimulating beta 2-adrenergic receptors, 
which increases cyclic AMP and produces functional antagonism to bronchoconstriction. There are short -acting (SABA) 
and long-acting (LABA) beta2-agonists. The effect of SABAs usually wears off within 4 to 6 hours .(748,749) Regular and as-
needed use of SABAs improve FEV1 and symptoms.(755) LABAs show duration of action of 12 or more hours  and do not 
preclude additional benefit from as -needed SABA therapy. (756) 
 
Formoterol and salmeterol are twice-daily LABAs that significantly improve FEV1 and lung volumes, dyspnea, health 
status, exacerbation rate and number of hospitalizations, (757) but have no effect on mortality or rate of decline of lung 
function. Indacaterol is a once daily LABA that improves breathlessness,(758,759) health status(759) and exacerbation 
rate.(759) Some patients experience cough following the inhalation of indacaterol. Oladaterol and vilanterol are 
additional once daily LABAs that improve lung function and symptoms. (760,761)

 Adverse effects 
Stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors can produce resting  sinus tachycardia and has the potential to precipitate 
cardiac rhythm disturbances in susceptible patients. Exaggerated somatic tremor is troublesome in some older 
patients treated with higher doses of beta 2-agonists, regardless of route of administration. Although hypokalemia can 
occur, especially when treatment is combined with thiazide diuretics ,(762) and oxygen consumption can be increased 
under resting conditions  in patients with chronic heart failure, (763) these metabolic effects decrease over time (i.e., 
show tachyphylaxis). Mild falls in partial pressure of oxygen ( PaO2) can occur after administration of both SABA s and 
LABAs(764) but the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. Despite prior concerns related to the use of beta2-
agonists in the management of asthma, no association between beta 2-agonist use and loss of lung function or 
increased mortality has been reported in COPD.(757,765,766) 
 
Antimuscarinic drugs  
Antimuscarinic drugs block the bronchoconstrictor effects of acetylcholine on M3 muscarinic receptors expressed in 
airway smooth muscle. (767) Short-acting antimuscarinics (SAMA s), namely ipratropium and oxitropium, also block the 
inhibitory neuronal receptor  M2, which potentially can cause vagally induced bronchoconstriction. (768) Long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, aclidinium, glycopyrronium bromide  (also known as 
glycopyrrolate), umeclidinium and revefenacin have prolonged binding to M3 muscarinic receptor s, with faster 
dissociation from M2 muscarinic receptors, thus prolonging the duration of bronchodilator effect. (767)  
 
A systematic review of RCTs concluded that ipratropium , a short acting muscarinic antagonis t, alone provided small 
benefits over short-acting beta2-agonist in terms of lung function, health  status and requirement for oral steroids .(769) 
Among LAMAs, some are administered once a day ( tiotropium, umeclidinium, revefenacin), others twice a day 
(aclidinium), and some are approved for once daily dosing in some countries and twice daily dosing in others 
(glycopyrrolate).(767,770) LAMA treatments improve symptoms, including cough and sputum  and health status.(767,771,772) 
They also improve the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation (773,774) and reduce exacerbations and related 
hospitalizations.(771) Clinical trials have shown a greater effect on exacerbation rates for LAMA treatment ( tiotropium) 
versus LABA treatment. (775,776)  
 
Adverse effects 
Inhaled anticholinergic drugs are poorly absorbed which limits the troublesome systemic effects observed with 
atropine.(767,777) Extensive use of this class of agents in a wide range of doses and clinical settings has shown them to 
be very safe. The main side effect is dryness of mouth .(768,778) Although occasional urinary symptoms have been 
reported, there are no data to prove a true causal relationship .(779) Some patients using ipratropium report a bitter, 
metallic taste. An unexpected small increase in cardiovascular events in COPD patients regularly treated with 
ipratropium bromide has been reported .(780,781) In a large, long-term clinical trial in COPD patients, tiotropium added 
to other standard therapies had no effect on cardiovascular risk. (740) Although there were some initial concerns 
regarding the safety of tiotropium delivery via the Respimat®(782) inhaler, the findings of a large trial observed no 
difference in mortality or exacerbation rates when comparing tiotropium in a dry-powder inhaler and the Respimat® 
inhaler.(783) There are less safety data available for the other LAMAs, but the rate of anti -cholinergic side effects for 
drugs in this class appears to be low and generally similar. Use of solutions with a facemask can precipitate acute 
glaucoma, probably as a direct result of the contact between the solution and the eye.(784-786) 
Methylxanthines  
Controversy remains about the exact effects of xanthine derivatives. They may act as non -selective phosphodiesterase 
inhibitors, but have also been reported to have a range of non -bronchodilator actions, the significance of which is 
disputed.(787-789) Data on duration of action for conventional, or even slow -release, xanthine preparations are lacking 
in COPD.

 Theophylline, the most commonly used methylxa nthine, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidases. 
Clearance of the drug declines with age. Many other physiological variables and drugs modify theophylline 
metabolism. Enhanced inspiratory muscle function has been reported in patients treated with methylxanthines,(787) 
but whether this reflects a reduction in gas trapping  or a primary effect on the respiratory skeletal muscles is not clear. 
All studies that have shown efficacy of theophylline in COPD were performed with sustained-release preparations.  
 
There is evidence for a modest bronchodilator effect compared with placebo in stable COPD .(790) Addition of 
theophylline to salmeterol produces a greater improvement in FEV1 and breathlessness than salmeterol alone .(791,792) 
Earlier studies reported  contradictory evidence regarding the effect of low-dose theophylline on exacerbation 
rates.(793,794) A study that investigate d the effectiveness of adding low -dose theophylline to ICS in COPD patients at 
increased risk of exacerbation showed no  difference compared with placebo in the number of COPD exacerbations 
over a one-year period.(795) A large placebo-controlled trial showed no effect of oral theophylline alone or in 
combination with prednisolone 5 mg daily on exacerbations of severe COPD. (796) 
 
Adverse effects 
Toxicity is dose-related, which is a particular problem with xanthine derivatives because their therapeutic ratio is small 
and most of the benefit occurs only when near -toxic doses are given .(788,790) Methylxanthines are non -specific inhibitors 
of all phosphodiesterase enzyme subsets, which explain s their wide range of toxic effects. Problems include atrial and 
ventricular arrhythmias (which can prove fatal) and grand mal convulsions (which can occur irrespective of prior 
epileptic history). Other side effects include headaches, insomnia, nausea, and heartburn, and these may occur within 
the therapeutic range of serum levels of theophylline. These medications have significant interactions with commonly 
used medications such as  erythromycin (but not azithromycin), certain quinolone antibiotics (ciprof loxacin, but not 
ofloxacin), allopurinol, cimetidine (but not ranitidine), serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluvoxamine) and the 5 -
lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton .  
Combination bronchodilator therapy  
Combining bronchodilators with different mechanisms and durations of action may increase the degree of 
bronchodilation with a lower risk of side -effects compared to increasing the dose of a single bronchodilator. (797,798) 
Combinations of SABA s and SAMAs are superior compared to either medication alone in improving FEV1 and 
symptoms.(799) Treatment with formoterol and tiotropium in separate inhalers has a bigger impact on FEV1 than either 
component alone.(800) There are numerous combinations of a LABA and LAMA in a single inhaler available (Figure 3.18). 
These combinations improve  lung function compared to placebo;(797) this improvement is consistently greater than 
long acting bronchodilator monotherap y effects although the magnitude of improvement is less than the fully additive 
effect predicted by the individual component responses. (801) Single inhalers improve adherence to treatment. (802) In 
studies where patient reported outcomes (PRO s) are the primary endpoint or in pooled analys es, combination 
bronchodilators have a greater impact on PRO s compared to monotherapies .(803-806)  In one clinical trial, combination 
LABA+LAMA treatment had the greatest improvement in quality of life compared to placebo or its individual 
bronchodilator components in patients with a greater baseline symptom burden. (807) A clinical trial showed that 
LABA+LAMA improved lung function and symptoms versus long -acting bronchodilator monotherapy in symptomatic 
patients with low exacerbation risk and not receiving inhaled corticosteroids .(562) The LABA+LAMA combination 
demonstrated favorable improvements compared with the monotherapies for the majority of outcomes irrespective 
of baseline HRQoL.(808) These clinical trials deal with group mean data, but symptom responses to LABA +LAMA 
combinations are best evaluated on an individual patient basis.  A lower dose, twice daily regimen for a LABA +LAMA 
has also been shown to improve symptoms and health status in COPD patients (809) (Figure 3.19). These findings have 
been shown in people across different ethnic groups (Asian as well as European). (810) 
 
Most studies with LABA +LAMA combinations have been performed in patients with a low rate of exacerbations. One 
study in patients with a history of exacerbations indicated that a combination of long -acting bronchodilators is more

 effective than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy  for preventing exacerbations .(811) Another large study found 
that combining a LABA with a LAMA did not reduce exacerbation rate as much as expected compared with a LAMA 
alone.(812) Another study in patients with a history of exacerbations showed that a combination LABA +LAMA decreased 
exacerbations to a greater extent than an LABA +ICS combination.(813) However, another study in a population with 
high exacerbation risk (≥ 2 exacerbations and/or 1 hospitaliz ation in the previous year) reported that  LABA+ICS 
decreased exacerbations to a greater extent than a LABA +LAMA combination at higher blood eosinop hil 
concentrations.(448) A large observational pharmaco -epidemiological study found similar effectiveness of LABA +LAMA 
and LABA+ICS but a significantly higher risk of pneumonia in those treated with LABA +ICS.(814)  
Anti-inflammatory agents  
To date, exacerbations (e .g., exacerbation rate, patients with at least one exacerbation, time -to-first exacerbation) 
represent the main clinically relevant end -point used for efficacy assessment of drugs with anti-inflammatory effects  
(Figure 3.20).

 Inhaled corticosteroids  (ICS)  
General considerations  
In vitro evidence suggests that COPD -associated inflammation has limited responsiveness to corticosteroids. 
Moreover, some drugs including beta 2-agonists, theophylline or macrolides may partially facilitate cort icosteroid 
sensitivity in COPD.(815,816) The clinical relevance of this effect has not yet been fully established.  
 
In vivo data suggest that the dose -response relationships and long -term (> 3 years) safety of ICS in people with COPD 
are unclear and require further investigation. (813) Because the effects of ICS in COPD can be modulated by the 
concomitant use of long -acting bronchodilators, these two therapeutic op tions are discussed separately.  
 
Both current and ex -smokers with COPD benefit from ICS use in terms of lung function and exacerbation rates, 
although the magnitude of the effect is lower in heavy or current smokers compared to light or ex -smokers. (448,817) 
 
Efficacy of ICS (alone)  
Most studies have found that regular treatment with ICS alone does not modify the long -term decline of FEV1 nor 
mortality in people with COPD.(818) Studies and meta-analyses assessing the effect of  regular treatment with ICS alone 
on mortality in people with COPD have not provided conclusive evidence of benefit. (818) In the TORCH trial, a trend 
toward higher mortality was observed for patients treated with fluticasone propionate alone compared to those 
receiving placebo or salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate combination. (697) However, an increase in mortality was 
not observed in COPD patients treated with fluticasone furoate in the Survival in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease with Heightened Cardiovascular Risk (SUMMIT)  trial.(819) In moderate COPD, fluticasone furoate alone or in 
combination with vilanterol was associated with slower decline in FEV1 compared with placebo or vilanterol alone by 
on average 9 mL/year.(820) A number of studies have investigated whether there is a relationship between ICS 
treatment and risk of lung cancer with conflicting results. (821) 
  
ICS in combination with long -acting bronchodilator therapy  
In patients with moderate  to very severe COPD  and exacerbations, an ICS combined with a LABA is more effective than 
either component alone in improving lung function , health status and reducing exacerbations .(822,823) Clinical trials 
powered on all-cause mortality as the primary outcome  failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of 
combination therapy on survival.(697,819) 
 
Most studies that found a beneficial effect of  a LABA+ICS fixed dose combination (FDC) over a LABA alone on 
exacerbation rate, recruited patients with a history of at least one exacerbation  in the previous year. (822) A pragmatic 
RCT conducted in a primary healthcare setting  in the United Kingdom compared a LABA+ICS combination with usual 
care. Findings showed an 8.4% reduction in moderate -to-severe exacerbations (primary outcome) and a significant 
improvement in CAT ™ score, with no difference in the rate of heal thcare contacts or pneumonias. However, basing  
recommendations on these results is difficult because of the heterogeneity of treatments reported in the usual care 
group, the higher rate of treatment changes in the group receiving the LABA+ICS combination of interest, and the 
medical practice patterns un ique to the UK region where the  study was conducted. (824)

Blood eosinophil count  
A number of studies have shown that blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of the effect of ICS (added on 
top of regular maintenance bronchodilator treatment) in preventing future exacerbations. (443-448) There  is a continuous 
relationship between blood eosinophil counts and ICS effects; no and/or small effects are observed at lower eosinophil 
counts, with incrementally increasing effects observed at higher eosinophil counts. (453) Data modeling indicates that 
ICS containing regimens have little or no effect at a blood eosinophil count < 100 cells/µL, (443) therefore this threshold 
can be used to identify patients with a low likelihood of treatment benefit with ICS. In addition, lower blood and 
sputum eosinophils are associated with greater presence of proteobacteria, (825-827) notably haemophilus, and increased 
bacterial infections and pneumonia. (828) Lower blood eosinophil counts therefore may identify individuals with 
microbiome profiles associated with increased risk of clinical worsenings due to pathogenic bacterial species. The 
threshold of a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/µL identifies the to p of the continuous relationship between 
eosinophils and ICS, and can be used to identify patients with the greatest likelihood of treatment benefit with ICS.  
 
Sources of evidence include: 1) Post -hoc analyses comparing LABA+ICS versus LABA (443,444,446); 2) Pre-specified analyses 
comparing triple therapy versus LABA+LAMA or LAMA (445,447,448); and 3) other analyses comparing LABA+ICS versus 
LABA+LAMA(829) or studying ICS withdrawal. (573,574,830) 
 
The treatment effect of ICS containing regimens (LABA+LAMA+ICS and LABA+ICS vs LABA+LAMA) is higher in patients 
with high exacerbation risk (≥ 2 exacerbations and / or 1 hospitalization in the previous year). (445,448,813) Thus, the use 
of blood eosinophil counts to predict ICS effects should always be combined with clinical assessment of exacerbation

 risk (as indicated by the previous history of exacerbations).  Other factors (smoking status, ethnicity, geographical 
location) could influence the relationship between ICS effect and blood eosinophil count but remains to be further 
explored. 
 
Factors to consider when initiating ICS treatment in combination with one or two long -acting bronchodilators are 
shown in Figure 3.21.(519) 
 
Adverse effects 
There is high quality evidence from RCTs that ICS use modifies the airway microbiome (831) and is associated with higher 
prevalence of oral candidiasis, hoarse voice, skin bruising and pneumonia .(818) This excess risk has been confirmed in  
ICS studies using fluticasone furoate, even at low doses. (832) Patients at higher risk of pneumonia include those who 
currently smoke, are aged ≥ 55 years, have a history of  prior exacerbations or pneumonia, a body mass index (BMI) < 
25 kg/m2, a poor MRC dyspnea grade and/or  severe airflow obstruction.(833,834) Independent of ICS use, there is 
evidence that a blood eosinophil count < 2% increases the risk of developing pneumonia. (835) In studies of patients with 
moderate COPD, ICS by itself or in combination with a LABA did not increase the risk of pneumonia. (819,834)  
 
Results from RCTs have yielded varied results regarding the risk of decreased bone density and fractures with ICS 
treatment, which may be due to differences in study designs and/or differences between ICS compounds .(738,832,836-838) 
Results of observational studies suggest that ICS treatment could also be associated with increased risk of 
diabetes/poor control of diabetes ,(839) cataracts,(840) and mycobacterial infection .(841) An increased risk of tuberculosis 
has been found in both observational studies and a meta -analysis of RCTs.(842-844) In the absence of RCT data on these 
issues, it is not possible to draw firm conclusion s.(845)  ICS and lung cancer incidence is discussed in Chapter 5.  
 
Withdrawal of ICS  
Results from withdrawal studies provide equivocal results regarding consequences of withdrawal on lung function, 
symptoms and exacerbations. (846-850) Some studies have shown an increase in exacerbations and/or symptoms 
following ICS withdrawal, while others have not. There has been evidence for a modest decrease in FEV1 
(approximately 40 mL) with ICS withdrawal, (850) which could be associated with increased baseline circulating 
eosinophil numbers.(830) A study examining ICS withdrawal on a background of dual bronchodilator therapy 
demonstrated that both FEV1 loss and an increase in exacerbation frequency associated with ICS withdrawal was 
greatest among patients with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/µL at baseline.(573) Differences between studies may 
relate to differences in methodology, including the use of background long -acting bronchodilator medication(s) which 
may minimize any effect of ICS withdrawal.  
Triple therapy (LABA+LAMA+ICS)  
The step up in inhaled treatment to LABA plus LAMA plus ICS (triple therapy) can occur by various approaches (851) and 
has been shown to improve lung function, patient reported outcomes and reduce exacerbations when compared to 
LAMA alone, LABA+LAMA and LABA+ICS.(445,447,448,852-859)  A post-hoc analysis of one of the RCTs that evaluated the 
effects of LABA+LAMA+ICS showed that triple therapy improved clinical outcomes versus dual therapy regardless of 
smoking status.(860) 
 
A post-hoc pooled analysis of three triple therapy clinical trials in COPD patients with severe airflow obstruction and a 
history of exacerbations showed a non -significant trend for lower mortality (assessed as a safety outcome) with triple 
inhaled therapy compared to non -ICS based treatments. (861) Two large one-year randomized controlled trials (named 
IMPACT and ETHOS) were reviewed earlier in Chapter 3 (see ‘Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality’ ) 
and provide new evidence on mortality reduction with fixed -dose inhaled triple combinations compared to dual 
bronchodilation.(566,862)

 Oral glucocorticoids  
Oral glucocorticoids  have numerous side effe cts, including steroid myopathy (863) which can contribute to muscle 
weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids 
for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients , or during emergency department visits, have been shown to  
reduce the rate of treatment failure , the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness .(864) 
Conversely, prospective studies on the long -term effects of oral glucocorticoids in stable COPD are limited. (865,866) 
Therefore, while oral glucocorticoids play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the 
chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.  
Phosphodiesterase -4 (PDE4) inhibitor  
The principal action of PDE4 inhibitors is to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic 
AMP.(867) Roflumilast is a once daily oral medication with no direct bronchodilator activity. Roflumilast reduces 
moderate and severe exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids in patients with chronic bronchitis, severe 
to very severe COPD, and a history of exacerbations .(868) The effects on lung function are also seen when roflumilast is 
added to long-acting bronchodilators ,(869) and in patients who are not controlled on fixed -dose LABA+ICS 
combinations.(568) The beneficial effects of roflumilast have been reported to be greater in patients with a prior history 
of hospitalization for an acute exacerbation. (570,572) There has been no study directly comparing roflumilast with an 
inhaled corticosteroid.  
 
Adverse effects 
Roflumilast has more adverse effects than inhaled medications for COPD .(870) The most frequent are diarrhea , nausea, 
reduced appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, and headache. Adverse effects have led to increased 
withdrawal rates from clinical trials. Adverse effects seem to occur early during treatment, are reversible, and diminish 
over time with continued treatment. In controlled studies an average unexplained weight loss of 2 kg has been seen 
and weight monitoring during treatment i s advised, in addition to avoiding roflumilast treatment in underweight 
patients. Roflumilast should also be used with caution in patie nts with depression.  
Antibiotics 
In older studies prophylactic, continuous use of antibiotics had no effect on the frequency of exacerbations in 
COPD(871,872) and a study that examined the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis undertaken in winter months over a period 
of 5 years concluded that there was no benefit .(873) Later studies have shown that regular use of some antibiotics may 
reduce exacerbation rate.(874,875) 
 
Azithromycin (250 mg/day or 500 mg three times per week ) or erythromycin (250 mg two times per day) for one year 
in patients prone to exacerbations reduced the risk of exacerbations compared to usual care .(571,876,877) Azithromycin 
use was associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance , prolongation of QTc interval , and impaired 
hearing tests.(571) A post-hoc analysis suggests lesser benefit in active smokers. (572) There are no data showing the 
efficacy or safety of chronic azithromycin treatment to prevent COPD exacerbations  beyond one-year of treatment.  
 
Pulse therapy with moxifloxacin (400 mg /day for 5 days every 8 weeks) in patients with chronic bronchitis and frequent 
exacerbations had no beneficial effect on the exacerbation rate overall.(878) Long-term doxycycline did not reduce 
exacerbations, although there may be responder subgroups. (879) 
Mucolytic (mucokinetics, mucoregulators) and antioxidant agents (N-acetylcysteine,  
carbocysteine, erdosteine) 
In COPD patients not receiving ICS, regular treatment with mucolytics such as carbocysteine and N -acetylcysteine

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   81 
 (NAC) may reduce exacerbations and modestly improve health status.(880-883)  In contrast, it has been shown that 
erdosteine may have a significant effect on (mild) exacerbations irrespective of concurrent treatment with ICS. Due to 
the heterogeneity of studied populations , treatment dosing and concomitant treatments, currently available data do 
not allow precise identification of  the potential target population for antioxidant agents in COPD.(884)  
Other drugs with potential  to reduce exacerbations  
Four large phase 3 studies have investigated the efficacy of the anti -IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab (885) and 
the anti-IL-5 receptor- antibody benralizumab (886) in patients with severe COPD, recurrent exacerbations and 
peripheral blood evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high intensity inhaled therapy. The studies showed a 
15% to 20% reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations but the effect was not always statistically significant, and it 
was variable between studies and doses.  There was no effect on FEV1 or quality of life scores and no consistent 
relationship between the response to treatment and the peripheral blood eosinophil count. A post-hoc analysis of the 
mepolizumab trial showed greater benefit and more clear evidence of a blood eosinophil related treatment effect 
against oral corticosteroid treated exacerbations raising the possibility that this treatment might find a role in a highly 
selected subgroup of patients with eosinophilic COPD and frequent requirement for oral corticosteroids. Further 
studies are required to investigate this possibility.  
 
A RCT showed that treatment with the humanized anti -IL-4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody dupilumab reduced 
exacerbations and improved FEV1 as well as symptoms and health-related quality of life in patients with COPD, chronic 
bronchitis, a baseline blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/µL, and a relevant exacerbation history. These findings are 
potentially important and clinical practice changing but require confirmation in further studies. (887)    
 
Nedocromil and leukotriene modifiers have not been tested adequately in COPD patients  and the available evidence 
does not support their use. (888,889) 
 
There was no evidence of benefit , and some evidence of harm , including malignancy and pneumonia , following 
treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) in moderate to severe COPD. (890)  
 
A recent Cochrane meta -analysis did not show sufficient evidence to support the use of immunostimulants. (891) 
 
An RCT of the selective β1 receptor blocker metoprolol in patients with moderate or severe COPD, who did not have 
an established indication for beta -blocker use, showed it did not delay the time until the first COPD exacerbation 
compared to the placebo group and hospitalization for exacerbation was more common among the patients treated 
with metoprolol.(892) There is no evidence that beta -blockers should be used in people with COPD who do not have a 
cardiovascular indication for their use.  
 
Simvastatin did not prevent exacerbations in people with COPD who had no metabolic or cardiovascular indication for 
statin treatment.(893) An association between statin use and improved outcomes  (including decreased exacerbations 
and mortality) has been reported in o bservational studies of people with COPD who received them for cardiovascular 
and metabolic indications .(894) 
 
There is no evidence that supplementation with vitamin D has a positive impact on exacerbations  in unselected 
patients.(895) In a meta-analysis vitamin D supplementation reduced exacerbation rates in patients with low baseline 
vitamin D levels,(896) but a more recent study has shown no effect. (897)

 Adherence to inhaled COPD medications  
Adherence is defined as the process by which a person takes their medication as prescribed by a healthcare 
provider.(898)  Adherence to therapy is a challenging issue in any chronic condition including COPD.  
 
Non-adherence to COPD medication has been associated with poor symptom control, increased risk of exacerbation, 
increased healthcare utilization and costs, decreased health -related quality of life and higher mortality risk. (899-909)  
 
Although inhaled therapy is a key component in the management of COPD, the adherence to inhaled medication is 
generally low, even in very severe disease. One systematic review (910) reported non-adherence rates to COPD 
medication of 22% to 93%, with over half of the included studies reporting non -adherence in > 50% of subjects.(910) 
Most studies included were conducted in high -income countries and many used pharmacy claims data to assess 
adherence.(910) Self-reported non-adherence to COPD medication varies between 28% and 74% (mean 50.9 %) in high 
income countries(901,910,911) and between 46% and 93% (mean 61.7 %) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).(912-
915) However, when compared with data obtained through electronic monitoring, studies have consistently 
demonstrated that self -reports are inaccurate as people generally over -report medication use. (916,917) 
 
Adherence is a complex concept, influenced by multiple factors including social/environmental, person -related and 
treatment-related factors.(918) Several studies have explored the variables associated with medication adherence in 
people with COPD.(910,912) Factors such as the presence of co -morbidities, in particular depression, smoking status, 
schooling level, disease severity, and drug regimen factors such as dosage complexity, polypharmacy and side effects 
of therapy, are the main factors associated with low adherence.(909,910,912,913,919,920) In addition, socioeconomic factors, 
including unemployment, low -income status, immigration status, living alone and poor medication availability (60) have 
been shown to negatively influence inhaled medication adherence and to be related to the non -use of 
medication.(919,921,922)   
 
Although patient preferences may vary, prescribing strategies that could help improve adherence often include 
selecting devices with a similar inhalation technique (in the case of multiple inhalers) and combination therapy. (589,923)  
 
Healthcare provider and caregiver factors can also contribute to perception of disease, healthcare, medication and 
ultimately adherence.  A better understanding of the disease and drug therapy, as well as greater trust in healthcare 
professionals and pharm acist-led interventions have been shown to improve COPD medication adherence. (611,910) Self-
management education can help a person understand their disease and the benefits of proper use of medication. 
Prescribing behavioral components that are tailored to the individual barriers of each person (e .g., keeping 
medications in one place, self -monitoring of symptoms, medication reminders, etc) is more effective in changing 
behavior than offering general suggestions. A study assessing interventions intended to improve adherence to 
pharmacological therapy s howed that multi-component interventions with education, motivational or behavioral 
components delivered by health professionals may improve adherence. (657) Involving a person in establishing an 
individually tailored treatment plan has been shown to improve adherence. (924) Further research on medication 
adherence in COPD is needed to gain insight into the effectiveness of different self -management education and health 
behavior change strategies.

 Other pharmacologic al treatments 
Other pharmacologic al treatments for COPD are summarized in Figure 3.22. 
 
 
 
Alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy  
The logical approach to minimize the development and progression of lung disease in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency 
(AATD) patients is alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation. Such ther apy has been available in many, though not all,  
countries since the 1980s. Because AATD is rare, few clinical trials to assess efficacy with  conventional spirometric 
outcome have been undertaken. However, a wealth of  observational studies suggest a reduction in spirometric 
progression in treated versus  non-treated patients(925) and that this reduction is most effective for patients with FEV1 
35% to 49% predicted.(926) Never or ex-smokers with an FEV1 of 35% to 60% predicted have been suggested as those 
most suitable for AATD augmentation therapy ( Evidence B). 
 
The available clinical trial and registry data have almost exclusively been focussed on patients with the ZZ (ZZ-
AATD/PiZZ) genotype. Risks to other genotypes have not been explored in clinical trials although people with the Z/null 
or null/null genotypes have even lower levels of plasma AAT and are usually assessed for augmentation therapy. Other 
genotypes are not considered at risk or likely to benefit from augmentation therapy. Recent studies have suggested 
an increased risk of developing mild COPD in heterozygotes for the Z gene (106,107) although unlike ZZ neither develop 
COPD in the absence of smoking, so smoking cessation is thought to prevent progression and hence augmentation is 
not necessary or appropriate.  
 
Studies using sensitive parameters of emphysema progression determined by CT scans have provided evidence for an 
effect on preserving lung tissue compared to placebo. (927-929) Based on the last trial the indications for therapy have 
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   84 
 been extended to include "those patients with evidence of progressive lung disease despite other optimal therapy ." 
However, not all patients with AATD develop or persist with rapid spirometric progression especially following smoking 
cessation.(930) Since the purpose of augmentation therapy is to preserve lung function and structure it seems logical to 
reserve such expensive therapy for those with evidence of continued and rapid progression following smoking 
cessation.(930)  
 
The indication for AAT augmentation is emphysema although there are no fixed criteria for diagnosis or confirmation.  
The evidence for augmentation therapy efficacy varies according to the outcome studied .(931) Intravenous 
augmentation therapy has been recommended for individuals with AATD and an FEV1 ≤ 65% predicted based on 
previous observational studies. However, t he last study powered on CT scan as an outcome has recommended that all 
patients with evidence of progressive lung disease should be considered for  those with lung disease related to AATD , 
and an FEV1 > 65%. Individual discussion is recommended with consideration of the cost of therapy and lack of 
evidence for much benefit.(932) The main limitation for this therapy is the very high cost and lack of availability  in many 
countries. 
 
Antitussives 
The role of antitussives in people with COPD is inconclusive.(933) 
 
Vasodilators 
Vasodilators have not been properly assessed in COPD patients with severe/disproportionate pulmonary 
hypertension. Inhaled nitric oxide can worsen gas exchange because of altered hypoxic regulation of ventilation -
perfusion balance and is contraindicated in stable COPD. (934) Studies have shown that sildenafil does not improve the 
results of rehabilitation in people with COPD and moderately increase s pulmonary artery pressure .(935) Tadalafil does 
not appear improve exercise capacity or health status in COPD patients with mild pulmonary hypertension. (936)  
Management of mucus hypersecretion  
Treatment goals for patient with chronic bronchitis ( CB) include: 1) reducing the overproduction of mucus; 2) 
decreasing mucus hypersecretion by reducing inflammation;  3) facilitating elimination of mucus by increasing ciliary 
transport; 4) decreasing mucus viscosity ; and 5) facilitating cough mechanisms.  Smoking cessation can improve cough 
by improving mucociliary function and decreasing goblet cell hyperplasia. (937)  Smoking cessation may decrease airway 
injury by limiting immune mechanisms that cause persistent inflammation and abnormal epithelial cell gene 
expression.(938) 
 
Mucus clearance treatments that promote mechanical movement through the airway such as oscillating positive 
expiratory pressure (OPEP) therapy may improve mucus mobilization, symptoms and quality of life in people with 
COPD who produce sputum daily or most days .(939,940) The use of nebulized hypertonic saline for copious mucus has 
been used in obstructive lung disease and cystic fibrosis with beneficial effects. However, in patients with COPD, 
current studies are limited, and results are inconsistent (941-945)   
 
Long-acting muscarinic antagonists, predominantly tiotropium and aclidinium, can improve sputum production and 
decrease cough in patients with moderate to severe COPD. (946-949) Triple therapy with dual long acting bronchodilators 
combined with inhaled steroids may be effective in reducing exacerbations and improving lung function and quality of 
life regardless of the presence of mucus hypersecretion.  
 
Use of mucolytics was associated with a reduction of 0.03 exacerbations per participant per month compared with 
placebo, that is, about 0.36 per year, or one exacerbation every three years. Very high heterogeneity was noted for 
this outcome, so results nee d to be interpreted with caution. (881) Nevertheless, in participants with chronic bronchitis 
or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics may produce a small reduction in acute

 exacerbations and a small effect on overall quality of life .(881) Recombinant human DNase has similarly shown lack of 
benefit in mucopurulent patients with COPD. (950,951) New classes of mucolytics agents are being developed. (952)  In a 
small double-blind placebo-controlled study, patients randomized to receive a CFTR potentiator icenticaftor had 
improvements in FEV1 and sputum bacterial colonization compared to placebo. (953)  New bronchoscopic interventions 
have been proposed to reduce mucus hypersecretion by eliminating airway goblet cell hyperplasia and submucosal 
glands. Liquid nitrogen metered cryospray, rheoplasty, and targeted lung denervation are currently under 
evaluation.(954-957) 
 
Overview of the evidence : Non-pharmacological therap y 
Self-management 
A Delphi process has resulted in a conceptual definition for COPD self -management interventions: “A COPD self-
management intervention is structured but personalized and often multi -component, with goals of motivating, 
engaging and supporting the patients to positively adapt their health behavior(s) and develop skills to better manage 
their disease.”(624) The process requires iterative interactions between patients and healthcare professionals who are 
competent in delivering self-management interventions. Behavior change techniques are used to elicit patient 
motivation, confidence  and competence. Literacy sensitive approaches are used to enhance comprehensibility .(624) 
 
Systematic reviews have provided evidence that self-management interventions improve outcomes in COPD.  A 2022 
Cochrane review reported that interventions for people with COPD are associated with improvements in HRQoL, a 
lower probability of respiratory -related hospital admissions, and no excess respiratory -related and all-cause mortality 
risks.(958) This strengthens the view that self -management interventions are unlikely to cause harm. There had 
previously been concerns that health benefits from self -management programs in COPD could be counterbalanced by 
increased mortality.(959,960) However, a previous Cochrane review and another meta -analysis reported no impact o f 
self-management interventions on overall mortality, and while the Cochrane review did find a small, but statistically 
significant, higher respiratory -related mortality rate in the self -management invention group as compared to usual 
care, the authors of the review stated the results should be interpreted with caution as misclassification in cause of 
death is common, the overall effect was dominated by t wo studies, and no effect on all -cause mortality was seen in 
the overall analysis. Furthermore, two independent, well designed studies, the COMET (961) and the PIC-COPD,(962) have 
shown the potential for reduction in mortality from integrated case management with self -management interventions. 
The program in these two studies may have promoted earlier appropriate treatment for exacerbations, which could 
have prevented some fatal complications.  These data, in conjunction with the most recently published Cochrane 
review, once again strength ens the view that self-management interventions are unlikely to cause harm. (958) 
 
An RCT has shown that implementation of a comprehensive 3 -month program to improve long -term self-management 
of patients recently discharged from hospital  with COPD exacerbation resulted in nearly two -fold higher rates of COPD -
related hospitalizations and emergency visits over 6 months. These data suggest that self -management strategies in 
recently hospitalized patients may lead to increased health care ser vice utilization compared with usual care. (963) 
 
There remain problems with heterogeneity among interventions, consistency of their application, specifics of the 
intervention, patient populations, follow-up times and outcome measures that make generalization difficult in real 
life. It is also challenging to formulate clear recommendations regarding the most effective form and content of a self -
management intervention in COPD given the range of heterogeneity across studies, and lack of prec ise definitions of 
self-management components (e .g., skills taught) and fidelity measures.  The recent conceptual definition shoul d help 
redress these deficiencies. For example, in the definition it is mentioned that: “The process requires iterative 
interactions between patients and healthcare professionals who are competent in delivering self -management

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   86 
 interventions.”  Having proper health coaching is important to improve self -management abilities. In people with 
COPD admitted for an exacerbation , a study has reported the positive effect of health coaching , commencing at the 
time of hospital discharge, on  reducing risk of re-hospitalization and emergency department visits. (964) Furthermore, 
this randomized study indicated that health coaching delivered by a respiratory therapist or nurse may improve self-
management abilities as demonstrated by meaningful improvements in Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire 
mastery scores.(965) 
Integrated care programs  
COPD is a complex disease that requires the input of multiple care providers who need to work together closely. In 
principle, use of a formal structured program that determines how each component is delivered should make care 
more efficient and effective, but the evidence for this is divided. A meta -analysis of 52 studies shows that integrated 
disease management probably results in improvement in disease -specific quality of life, exercise capacity, hospital 
admissions, and hospital days , although not mortal ity.(966) In contrast, a large multicenter study in primary care within 
an existing well-organized system of care did not confirm this .(967) Besides, delivering integrated interventions by 
telemedicine did not show a significant effect. (968,969) The pragmatic conclusion is that well organized care is important, 
but there may be no advantage in structuring it tightly into a formalized program.  Furthermore, integrated care needs 
to be individualized to the stage of the person’s illness and health literacy.  
Physical activity  
Pulmonary rehabilitation, including community and home -based, is an approach with clear evidence of benefits. 
However, the challenge is promoting physical activity and maintaining it. There is evidence that physical activity is 
decreased in COPD patients. (970) This leads to a downward spiral of inactivity which predisposes patients to reduced 
quality of life, increased rates of hospitalization and mortality. (971-973) As such, there has been tremendous interest in 
implementing behavior -targeted interventions with the aim of improving physical activity (974) and these should be 
encouraged.(971) Technology-based interventions have the potential to provide convenient and accessible means to 
enhance exercise self -efficacy, and to educate and motivate people in their efforts to make healthy lifestyle 
changes.(975) The use of an internet -mediated intervention may benefit people with COPD with low baseline self-
efficacy to increase physical activity. (976) However, most published studies to date provide little guidance, being 
inconsistent in the techniques, and lacking the necessary details (e.g., type, quantity, timing and method of delivery; 
tools used; quality-assurance methods) to replicate the study or adapt the interventions for clinical care.  One RCT that 
evaluated the long-term effectiveness of a community -based physical activity coaching intervention in people with 
COPD exacerbation history showed no benefits in acute care use or survival. (977) Another pedometer -based physical 
activity interventional study (pedometer alone or pedometer plus a website with feedback) showed an association 
between the intervention and reduced risk for acute exacerbations over 12 -15 months of follow -up.(978) Non-
pharmacological intervention s such as pursed lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing have  also been shown to 
improve pulmonary function and increased exercise capacity in patients with COPD .(979) 
Exercise training  
A meta-analysis of RCTs found that e xercise training alone , or with the addition of activity counseling , significantly 
improved physical activity levels  in COPD patients.(980) A combination of constant load or interval training with strength 
training provides better outcomes than either method alone. (981)  
 
Where possible, endurance exercise training to 60 -80% of the symptom -limited maximum work or heart rate is 
preferred,(982) or to a Borg-rated dyspnea or fatigue score of 4 to 6 (moderate to severe). (983) Endurance training can be 
accomplished through either continuous or interval exercise programs. The latter involves the patient doing the same 
total work but divided into briefer periods of high -intensity exercise, a useful strategy when performance is lim ited by 
other comorbidities. (984,985)

 In some cultures, other alternatives such as Tai Chi practice, emphasizing the use of ‘mind’ or concentration for control 
of breathing and circular body movement, has been shown to improve exercise capacity in comparison to usual care 
in COPD patients.(986) However from this meta -analysis, the effects of Tai Chi in reducing dyspnea level and improving 
quality of life remain inconclusive. Future studies addressing these topics and the most beneficial protocol s for Tai Chi 
practice are warranted. 
 
Exercise training can be enhanced by optimizing bronchodilators, (774) since both LAMA and LABA have shown reduced 
resting and dynamic hyperinflation. These changes contribute to better training effects .(282,987) Adding strength training 
to aerobic training is effective in improving strength, but does not improve health status or exercise tolerance. (988) 
Upper extremities exercise training improves arm strength and endurance , and results in improved functional capacity 
for upper extremity activities. (989) Exercise capacity may also be improved by whole -body vibration training. (990) 
 
Inspiratory muscle training increases strength of inspiratory muscles ,(991) but this not consistently translate to better 
performance, reduced dyspnea or improved health related quality of life when added to a comprehensive pulmonary 
rehabilitation program .(992-994) 
Pulmonary rehabilitation  
The benefits to COPD patients from pulmonary rehabilitation are considerable  (Figure 3.23), and rehabilitation has 
been shown to be the most effective therapeutic strategy to improve shortness of b reath, health status and exercise 
tolerance.(995) Pulmonary rehabilitation is appropriate for most people with COPD; improved functional exercise 
capacity and health related quality of life have been demonstrated across all grades of COPD severity, although the 
evidence is especially strong in patients with moderate to severe dis ease. Even patients with chronic hypercapnic 
failure show benefit. (996,997)  
 
Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation can be  seen in a significant minority of COPD patients and has been associated 
with impaired quality of life, exacerbation risk, and mortality. (998) A large RCT did not suggest clinical improvement 
with long term oxygen therapy for patients without resting hypoxemia but exertional desaturation. (999) During 
pulmonary rehabilitation it is common practice to supplement oxygen during exercise training with the aim of 
facilitating higher exercise intensity. There was little support for oxygen supplementation during exercise training for 
individuals with COPD from a 2007 systematic review,(1000) but most evidence was limited by low study quality. A large 
RCT,(631) with blinding of participants, trainers and assessors , demonstrated that COPD patients training with either 
supplemental oxygen or medical air had significantly improved exercise capacity and health -related quality of life ; no 
greater benefit with oxygen was observed. T he incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups. 
In patients with severe COPD on long -term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in whom exercise training is done with oxygenation 
systems, there has been increased interest in using an alternative tool, namely nasally administered mixtures of 
humidified air-oxygen blends at flow rates of 20 -60 L/min (HFNT). HFNT may reduce respiratory muscle load and 
respiratory rate, while increasing expiratory time. (1001) In an RCT, the delivery of HFNT during training sessions, as 
compared with usual oxygen, was not associated with a greater improvement in endurance time, the primary 
outcome, or in health status .(1002) However, a greater improvement in 6-minute walking distance ( 6MWD) test was 
observed with HFNT. A similar small trial suggested an improved walk ing distance.(1003) The proportion of patients 
reaching the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in endurance time and 6MWD was also significantly higher 
with HFNT. Finally, there was no significant difference between the two therapies in patients’ satisfaction. Fu rther 
studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of  this treatment.

There are data from large RCTs regarding the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation after hospitali zation for an 
acute exacerbation of COPD. A systematic review that included 13 RCTs reported reduced mortality, and number of 
readmissions among patients who had pulmonary rehabilitation  initiated during hospitalization or within 4 weeks of 
discharge.(701) Long-term effects on mortality were not statistically significant, but improvements in health -related 
quality of life and exercise capacity appeared to be maintained for at least 12 months. These results have been 
corroborated by real world evidence, from a large population-based cohort of more than 190,000 patients  hospitalized 
for COPD in the US, in whom initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation within 90 days of discharge, while rare, was 
significantly associated with lower risk of mortality (704) and fewer rehospitalization s at one year.(1004) One study has 
reported that initiating pulmonary rehabilitation before the patient’s discharge may compromise survival through 
unknown mechanisms. (1005) Pulmonary rehabilitation ranks as one of the most cost -effective treatment strategies. (615) 
 
There are many challenges with pulmonary rehabilitation. Referral of patients who might benefit, uptake and 
completion of pulmonary rehabilitation is frequently limited, partly through provider ignorance as well as patients’ 
lack of awareness of availabili ty or benefits. The recommended length of pulmonary rehabilitation  (minimum of 6 
weeks) could also be a limitation in many countries due to funding constraints of  insurance companies and/or national 
health funds. Virtual reality pulmonary rehabilitation could be an alternative combined or not with traditional exercise 
training; this may be of particular interest in countries where the length of pulmonary rehabilitation  programs is 
limited to less than 4 weeks. (1006) Another challenge is encouraging sustained long-term physical activity. Although the

 approach may need to be personalized, behavioral lifestyle physical activity intervention has shown promisi ng results 
i.e., the potential to decrease sedentarity and increase physical activity in patients with moderate to severe COPD. (1007) 
A major barrier to full participation is access, which is particularly limited by geography, culture, finances, transport 
and other logistics.(614,656,662,1008)  
 
Pulmonary rehabilitation can be conducted at a range of sites. (614) Community-based and home-based programs have 
been shown to  be as effective as hospital -based programs in randomized controlled trials, (1009,1010) as long as the 
frequency and intensity are equivalent. (1011) In countries where there is economic limitation or those with challenges 
because patients live in rural or remote regions, home -based programs that deliver exercise training using a stationary 
bicycle(1009) or a walking program (1010) could be considered as alternative to traditional hospital rehabilitation training 
programs. There is also evidence that  standardized home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve dyspn ea 
in COPD patients.(1012)  However, in real life, traditional pulmonary rehabilitation with supervision remains the standard 
of care and first-line option, with home -based exercise likely to be a less effective alternative for people with COPD 
who are unable to attend pulmonary rehabilitation. (1013) Another challenge is that  the benefits of rehabilitation tend 
to wane over time. There is insufficient evidence, with conflicting research findings in the 11 available RCTs, to 
recommend continuation of lower intensity or lower frequency exercise programs with the aim of maintaining benefit 
long-term. However, if such programs are available they should target health behavior taking into account the 
patient’s own preferences, needs and personal goals. (618,1014) Pulmonary rehabilitation may help reduce anxiety and 
depression symptoms. (1015) 
Tele-rehabilitation 
In- or out-patient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COPD is effective in improving several clinically relevant 
outcomes.(995,1016) There is clear evidence that core components of PR including exercise training combined with 
disease-specific education and self -management interventions (614,995) can benefit almost every COPD patient. (1017-1019)  
 
However, there are many challenges encountered in the delivery of PR, which include systemic barriers integral to 
some health care systems leading to a scarcity of in -person PR programs and facilities.  In many regions, the programs 
that do exist tend to b e located in urban areas. Hence attending PR is challenging for many COPD patients.  Even for 
those patients residing in urban areas, availability of frequent transportation that is required for out -patient PR may 
still be a challenge.   
 
Tele-rehabilitation has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional approaches. This has become even more 
relevant in the COVID -19 pandemic era where in -person PR has not been feasible, and models of delivery had to be 
adapted. However, it is import ant to distinguish between evidence -based tele-rehabilitation models and pandemic -
adapted models. Most of the available evidence regarding tele -rehabilitation has been analyzed in a recent Cochrane 
review.(1020)  
 
Across multiple trials performed in groups and individuals with a large variety of tele -rehabilitation delivery platforms 
(videoconferencing, telephone only, website with telephone support, mobile application with feedback, centralized 
“hub” for people to come together), the reported results suggest that tele -rehabilitation is safe and has similar benefits 
to those of center-based PR across a range of outcomes. The evidence -based models from the Cochrane review were 
published before the COVID -19 pandemic, and have all included an in -person exercise test at the center prior to 
commencement, for the purposes of assessing the full extent of desaturation during exercise training (1021) and 
accurately prescribing exercise capacity. (1022) 
 
Promoting physical activity is also central to the recommendations that should be given to every COPD patient 
regardless of disease severity . Promoting physical activity  using smartphone apps is gaining popularity although at 
present data on effectiveness are lacking.(1023)

 In the field of tele-rehabilitation, the evidence base is still evolving and best practices are not yet established at this 
time due to a lack of: i) standardization of delivery platform, e.g., no one single best mode of tele -rehabilitation 
delivery; ii) tests performed remotely allowing for accurate exercise prescription; iii) information on suitable variations 
in components and timing of interventions (e.g., no data are available regarding post -exacerbation rehabilitation); and 
iv) evidence about duration  of benefit (beyond immediate post PR).  Furthermore, it is unclear what types of patients 
were recruited to these studies or their level of familiarity with the technology used. In order to ensure that PR is 
accessible to all, we must understand the barri ers that might be unique to tele -rehabilitation.   
Nutritional support  
In people with COPD, weight loss and malnutrition develop as disease severity progresses and indicates a poor 
prognosis. Malnutrition in COPD is associated with impaired lung function, increased hospitalizations, poor exercise 
tolerance, worsened quality of life and increased mortality .(334,1024-1028) Malnutrition has been reported in 30 -60% of 
patients hospitalized with COPD; (1029) up to 50% of people with COPD weigh less than 90% of ideal body weight. (1030) 
Weight loss occurs when energy expenditure exceeds energy supply; in people with COPD decreases in appetite and 
oral intake often coincide with elevated systemic levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines and the appetite suppressant 
hormone, leptin.(1031,1032) The severity of airflow obstruction correlates with the presence of malnutrition (1033) since 
ventilator inefficiency increases daily energy requirements. (1034) The imbalance of decreased oral intake and increased 
energy expenditure can lead to a negative nitrogen balance and decreases in skeletal muscle mass and function. (1035-
1037) 
 
Nutritional repletion in people with COPD should be coupled with optimization of lung function, regular exercise, and 
improvement of tissue oxygenation. Dietary advice and oral supplementation have been reported to improve body 
weight, quality of life, respiratory muscle strength and 6 -minute walk distance. (679,1029) However, nutritional support 
has not been consistently shown to improve lung function. (679,1038-1040) Multimodality treatment that incorporates 
rehabilitation with nutritional support and protein supplementation may improve fat free mass, BMI and exercise 
performance.(1041) Among malnourished, hospitalized people with COPD, a protein enriched supplementation 
decreased mortality and improved handgrip strength, body weight and nutritional biomarkers 90 days post hospital 
discharge.(1042)

 INTERVENTIONAL & SURGICAL THERAPIES FOR COPD  
COPD is associated with airway and lung parenchyma structural changes that provide potential targets for 
interventional and surgical treatments to alleviate dyspnea, reduce cough and mucous production, and improve 
quality of life (Figure 3.24). 
 
 
 
Lung structural related therapies for COPD include airway and emphysematous predominant treatments. Phenotyping 
patients with clinical, physiological, and imaging tests is critical to select appropriate candidates and in assessing the 
benefits, timing, and  type of intervention to be performed. Multidisciplinary collaboration of pulmonology, thoracic 
surgery and imaging disciplines are necessary to ensure quality outcomes.  
 
Airway predominant treatments are currently the subject of Phase III clinical trials; emphysematous based treatments 
include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, bronchoscopic lung reduction and in select cases, lung 
transplantation. Each of these th erapies are reviewed below.  
 
Surgical and interventional treatments for patients with emphysema depends upon the severity of patient symptoms 
despite optimized medical treatment, the specific structural abnormalities and features of the lung seen on CT imaging, 
the presence of pulmona ry and non-pulmonary comorbid conditions, physiological assessment, and the balance of 
benefits and risks for the individual patient.

 Lung surgical treatments for patients with emphysema  
Bullectomy 
Giant bullectomy is a rare, but effective procedure for surgical resection of bulla that occupies > one -third of a 
hemithorax and compresses adjacent viable lung tissue. Reductions in dyspnea, and improvements in lung, respiratory 
muscle, and cardiac perfo rmance, as well as exercise tolerance have been reported. (1043-1045) Blood or thrombin 
instillation may be effective in those unfit for resection. (1046-1048) 
 
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)  
Lung hyperinflation is a major contributor to impaired respiratory function and is associated with increased 
hospitalization and mortality. Hyperinflation increases the sensation of breathlessness and causes a reduction in 
exercise due to increased chest w all elastance and reduced respiratory muscle and cardiac mechanics. Hyperinflation 
is most pronounced in those patients with COPD that have an emphysematous predominant phenotype.  
 
With LVRS, the most emphysematous portions of the lungs are resected to reduce hyperinflation, (1049) and increase 
lung elastic recoil pressure and density. (1050) The structural changes that result from LVRS can significantly improve 
expiratory flow and chest wall, respiratory muscle and cardiac mechanics. (1051,1052) that results in improvements in 
FEV1, walking distance and quality of life. (1053-1056) LVRS can be performed unilaterally or bilaterally.  In the National 
Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), a RCT that included severe emphysema patients, bilateral LVRS improved survival 
in patients with upper -lobe emphysema and low post -rehabilitation exercis e capacity.(289) In similar patients with high 
post-pulmonary rehabilitation exercise capacity, no difference in survival was noted after LVRS, although health status 
and exercise capacity improved. A reinterpretation of the NETT data at 5 years post treatment showed sust ained 
improvements in lung function, exercise, shortness of breath and quality of life. (1057)  
 
LVRS has been demonstrated to result in higher mortality than medical management in severe emphysema patients 
with FEV1 ≤ 20% predicted and either homogeneous emphysema on high resolution computed tomography or a DLco 
≤ 20% of predicted. (1058) In addition to a lower DLco, a lower FEV1 and BMI have also been reported to increase 
mortality.(1059) Postoperative BODE (body mass index, degree of airflow obstruction, level of dyspnea and exercise 
capacity) is a predictor of survival following LVRS. (1060) Successful outcomes with LVRS have been reported in select 
patients with severely impaired DLco when hyperinflation is severe, and associated with approachable 
emphysematous targets for resection. (1061) Identification of target zones using three -dimensional computed 
tomographic imaging is beneficial in selecting resectable target zones. (1062) A prospective economic analysis in NETT 
indicated that LVRS is costly relative to healthcare programs that do not include surgery. (1063)  
 
Post NETT, experienced centers have reported substantial physiological and functional improvements with LVRS with 
reduced morbidity and mortality. (1064,1065) However, the number s of patients undergoing LVRS remain low 
worldwide.(1065,1066) Several patient factors such as difficulty in obtaining referrals, the perception of increased surgical 
complications, and limited continuity of care are reasons why the numbers of patients undergoing LVRS remain low 
despite its reported benefits. (1067) Additionally, respiratory physicians  are reluctant to refer patients for LVRS because 
of the uncertainty about the associated complications, or lack of access to a multidisciplinary team to discuss patient 
candidates.(1068) To achieve successful outcomes, a  multidisciplinary team is key to select potential LVRS patients and 
coordinate postoperative care. (1069) 
 
Lung transplantation  
Over 1,000 patients with COPD undergo lung transplantation on an annual basis, about 30.6% of all patients that 
undergo transplantation. (1070) Since implementation of the lung allocation severity (LAS) scoring system, the numbers 
of patients undergoing lung transplantation for COPD is exceeded by the numbers of patients receiving transplantation 
for interstitial lung diseases.  Patients with COP D should be referred for consideration of lung transplantation when

 they have progressive disease despite maximal medical treatment, are not candidates for lung volume reduction 
surgery, have a BODE index of 5 to 6, a PaCO 2 > 50 mmHg (6.6 kPa) and/or PaO 2 < 60 mmHg (8 kPa) and FEV1 < 25%. (1071) 
They should be considered for listing for lung transplantation when the BODE index is > 7, FEV1 is < 15 % to 20%, and 
they have had three or more severe exacerbations during the previous year, one severe exacerbation with hypercapnic 
respiratory failure, or have moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. (1071) In the last decade, lung transplant has 
been increasingly performed in patients of older age, higher BMI, prior chest surgery, poor nutritional status, prior 
evidence of chronic infection, cardiovascular disease, or extrapulmonary comorbid conditions. (1072)  
 
Lung transplantation in patients with COPD has been predominately associated with an improvement in quality of life, 
not an increase in survival except for COPD patients with severe AATD or those severely impaired with high BODE 
scores.(1043,1073-1079) The median survival post lung transplantation for COPD is 5.9 years. (1070) Over 70% of lung 
transplants conducted in COPD patients are double lung transplants; the remainder are single lung transplants. (1080) 
Bilateral lung transplantation leads to longer survival in patients with COPD especially in those < 60 years of 
age.(1081,1082)  
 
Two unique native lung complications have been proposed to account for the superiority of double lung 
transplantation in patients with COPD, native lung hyperinflation and lung cancer occurrence in the native 
lung.(1083,1084) Lung cancer has been reported to occur in the native lung following single lung transplantation with an 
incidence of 5.2-6.1%.(1083,1085)  Native lung hyperinflation following single lung transplantation for COPD has been 
reported to occur 15 -30% of the time.(1086,1087) Positive pressure ventilation in a patient with COPD with an overly 
compliant native lung coupled with reduced compliance in an edematous allograft may result in native lung 
hyperinflation. However, some studies have shown no impact of single lung transpl ant on post-transplant morbidity, 
and even improved survival following single lung transplantation in patients with COPD. (1086,1088,1089)  
 
In general, lung transplantation has limited availability due to the shortage of donor organs and cost, thus single vs. 
double lung transplantation is balanced between individual patient factors vs. societal demands to increase the donor 
pool for eligible recipients.(1090) The complications most seen in COPD patients after lung transplantation are acute 
rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, opportunistic infections and lymphoproliferative disease. (1091) 
Bronchoscopic interventions in COPD 
► In selected patients with heterogeneous or homogenous emphysema and significant hyperinflation refractory 
to optimized medical care, surgical or bronchoscopic modes of lung volume reduction (e.g., endobronchial 
one-way valves, lung coils or thermal ablation) may be considered.(1092) Some of these therapies (vapor 
ablation and lung coils) are not widely available for clinical care in many countries. 
► In selected patients with a large bulla , surgical bullectomy may be considered . 
► In selected patients with very severe COPD and without relevant contraindications , lung transplantation may 
be considered.  
 
Bronchoscopic Interventions to reduce hyperinflation in severe emphysema  
Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with LVRS, less invasive bronchoscopic approaches to lung reduction 
have been examined. (1093) These include a variety of different bronchoscopic procedures to perform lung volume 
reduction (i.e., endoscopic lung volume reduction, ELVR) including airway bypass stents, endobronchial one -way 
valves (EBV) , self-activating coils, sealants and thermal ablative techniques. (1093) Although these techniques differ 
markedly from one another they are similar in their objective to decrease thoracic volume to improve lung, chest wall 
and respiratory muscle mechanics.  
 
Choosing bronchoscopic lung reduction (endobronchial valve, coil placement or thermal ablation) or surgical resection 
(lung volume reduction surgery, LVRS) to treat hyperinflation in an emphysematous patient depends on a number of

 factors. These include: the extent and pattern of emphysema identified on HRCT; the presence of interlobar collateral 
ventilation measured by fissure integrity on HRCT or physiological assessment (endoscopic balloon occlusion and flow 
assessment); regional  availability of the various therapies for clinical care, local proficiency in the performance of the 
procedures; and patient and provider preferences. Bronchoscopic techniques depend upon the presence of an intact 
fissure between the treated and non -treated lobe for EBV to be successful, but not for the other techniques. Vapor 
ablation therapy is the only lung reduction therapy that has been reported to be successfully performed at the 
segmental rather than lobar level. (1094) Figure 3.25 provides an overview of the various interventional and surgical 
options for patients with emphysema.  
 
 
 
Endobronchial one -way valves (EBV) 
EBV are the most well studied therapy of all the ELVR techniques. RCTs showed significant increases in FEV1 and 6 -
minute walk distance as well as health status in subjects selected for the absence of interlobar collateral ventilation 
compared to the contro l group at 6 and 12 months. (291,501)  Adverse effects in the endobronchial valve treatment group 
in both studies included pneumothorax, valve removal or valve replacement. (501) Pneumothorax was seen in 26.6% of 
subjects treated with the endobronchial valve usually within the first 72 hours of the procedure (76%). (291,1095,1096) But 
benefits have also been shown in patients with heterogeneous compared to those with homogenous emphysema in 
one study.(501)  
 
Early-onset pneumothorax in the EBV treated group likely results from lung structural changes due to acute volume 
reduction in the emphysematous targeted lobe by valve therapy that triggers rapid ipsilateral non -targeted lobe

 expansion, a recognized indicator of successful target lobe occlusion in patients with intact fissures or absence of 
collateral ventilation. (290) Pleural adhesions may also be a contributing factor to the development of a 
pneumothorax.(1097) The occurrence of pneumothorax highlights the need for physicians performing this procedure to 
have expertise in the management of procedural complications. (290)  
 
After the post-procedural period however, patients treated with EBV compared to usual care tend to have a lower 
number of exacerbations and episodes of respiratory failure. A comparison of treatment benefits and complications 
associated with EBV compared t o LVRS show comparable benefits with endobronchial valve treatment but with fewer 
complications.(291) Additionally, ELVR has similar beneficial effects whether it is performed in the upper or lower 
lobes.(290,291) 
 
Improved survival has been associated with post procedural atelectasis of the treated lobe post EBV. (1098-1100)  Improved 
survival has also been reported in patients with severe hyperinflation undergoing EBV compared to a matched 
population not undergoing ELVR. (1101) 
 
When preferences for medical treatment for patients with severe emphysema are elicited, the majority chose 
treatments with EBV over LVRS or continued medial therapy. (1102) ELVR with EBV is clinically available and approved 
for treatment in many countries in the treatment of patients who have intact fissures or lack collateral 
ventilation.(291,1103,1104)  
 
The following bronchoscopic lung volume reduction techniques do not depend upon the presence of intact fissures or 
absence of collateral ventilation.  
 
Airway bypass stents  
Airway bypass stents are transbronchial passages that are created through the walls of the central airways into the 
emphysematous parenchyma to facilitate the emptying of trapped gas. In a prospective randomized controlled clinical 
trial, patients had shor t term improvements, but no durable improvements were found in lung function, 6 MWD or 
quality of life.(1105)  
 
Sealants 
A multicenter study examining the effects of a lung sealant to create lung reduction was discontinued prematurely; 
while the study reported significant benefits in some physiologic parameters, the intervention was associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality.(1106) 
 
Vapor ablation 
In a prospective RCT, targeted thermal vapour ablation of more diseased emphysematous segments to produce 
fibrosis and atelectasis resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function and 
health status at 6 months. COPD exacerbation was the most common serious adverse event. Durability of these 
changes was subsequently reported at 12 months follow -up.(1094,1107) This therapy has limited clinical availability.  
 
Self-activating coils 
Multicenter trials have examined nitinol coils implanted into the lung compared to usual care on changes in 6 -minute 
walk distance, lung function and health status in patients with advanced homogenous and heterogeneous 
emphysema. Studies reported an increa se in 6-minute walk distance with coil treatment compared to control and 
smaller improvements in FEV1, and quality of life measured by St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire. (1108-1110)  Patients 
with baseline residual volume > 200% predicted, emphysema score > 20% low attenuation area, and absence of airway 
disease are more likely to have clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and quality of life. (1111)

 Major complications included pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemoptysis and COPD exacerbations occurring more 
frequently in the coil group. (1109) This therapy has limited clinical availability.  
 
Additional data are needed to define the optimal bronchoscopic lung volume technique to produce bronchoscopic 
lung volume reduction in patients who lack fissure integrity, or exhibit collateral ventilation, and to refine the 
procedure to reduce complicatio ns and improve longer term clinical outcomes. (1109) 
 
Sequential performance of LVRS or ELVR prior to or following lung transplantation  
Because COPD is a progressive disease, LVRS or ELVR may be followed by lung transplantation. Conversely, patients 
who undergo single lung transplantation may subsequently undergo LVRS or ELVR to treat the hyperinflated native 
lung. In hyperinflated patient s with advanced emphysema, LVRS or ELVR might be effective treatments to either delay 
the need for lung transplantation or optimize the condition of patients who may eventually require lung 
transplantation.(1112-1114) In some patients following single lung transplantation, the performance of LVRS or ELVR to 
decrease native lung hyperinflation may improve lung function and performance status. (1115-1120) The incidence of 
postoperative bleeding requiring re -exploration and renal dysfunction requiring dialysis or the use of extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be higher in patients undergoing lung transplantation following LVRS. (1121,1122) 
Previous ELVR has been reported to have no impact on morbidity or survival post subsequent lung transplantation but 
may affect microbial colonization. (1122,1123) 
 
Airway predominant treatments  
Abnormalities that predominantly involve the airways, such as excessive dynamic collapse of the large airways 
(tracheobronchomalacia) chronic bronchitis and frequent and severe exacerbations not responsive to optimal medical 
treatment pose significant clinical challenges.  
 
Excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC)  
EDAC or tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a disorder of the large airways where abnormal collapsibility occurs with 
expiration. Commons symptoms are dyspnea, cough and wheezing with inability to expectorate phlegm. In a cross -
sectional analysis of smokers the  presence of excessive dynamic airway collapse observed on CT imaging was 5% and 
associated with worsened quality of life and more frequent and severe exacerbations. (1124) Airway stenting and 
tracheoplasty may be beneficial in select patients. (1125,1126) 
 
Chronic bronchitis is a common and significant contributor to a worsening of patient’s symptoms of cough and sputum 
production and cause worsened quality of life and increased mortality. No specific medical intervention significantly 
and consistently allev iates chronic bronchitis. Newer interventions have been proposed to reduce mucous 
hypersecretion by eliminating airway goblet cell hyperplasia and submucosal glands.  
 
Nitrogen cryospray  
Liquid nitrogen metered cryospray is delivered to the central airways and ablates the epithelium to a depth of 0.1 to 
0.5 mm.(954) After treatment, rapid regeneration of normal epithelium occurs without scarring and may potentially 
treat chronic bronchitis. (1127) 
 
Another novel treatment for chronic bronchitis is rheoplasty. (1128) Rheoplasty delivers short bursts of high frequency 
electrical energy to the airway epithelium targeting submucosal tissues and goblet cells to facilitate their replacement 
with healthier tissue. Ongoing phase III randomized clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these therapies. (1129,1130) 
 
Lung denervation 
Targeted lung denervation is another therapy currently undergoing phase III clinical trial study to determine its impact 
of frequent moderate or severe exacerbations in patients with COPD already on maximal inhaled respiratory

 treatment.(1131,1132) The therapy intends to disrupt the parasympathetic nerve transmission to and from the lungs. In 
patients with COPD, basal parasympathetic tone is elevated and increases acetylcholine levels and mucus production 
and airway contraction. The treatment uses a  water-cooled catheter with radiofrequency energy to disrupt 
parasympathetic nerve transmission while protecting the airway surface. (956,957,1132,1133) 
 
Key points for interventional therapy in stable COPD are summarized in Figure 3.26. 
 
 
 
Surgery in the COPD patient  
General surgery   
Postoperative pulmonary complications are as important and common as postoperative cardiac complications and, 
consequently, are a key component of the increased risk posed by general surgery in COPD patients .(1134) The key 
factors that can contribute to the risk include smoking, poor general health status, age, obesity, and COPD severity. A 
comprehensive definition of postoperative pulmonary complications should include only major pulmonary respiratory 
complications, namely lung infections, atelectasi s and/or increased airflow obstruction, which all potentially result in 
acute respiratory failure and aggravation of COPD .(1135-1137)

Increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in COPD patients may vary with the severity of COPD, 
although the surgical site is the most important predictor  and risk increases as the incision approaches the 
diaphragm.(1137) Most reports conclude that epidural or spinal anesthesia have a lower risk than general anesthesia, 
although the results are not totally uniform.  Some studies conducted in patients undergoing sham bronchoscopic 
procedures have reported acute exacerbation rates as high as 8.4%. (1105) These data suggest that intubation and/or 
simple airway manipulation may increase the risk of exacerbation in select COPD patients.  
 
To prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, stable COPD patients clinically symptomatic and/or with limited 
exercise capacity should be treated medically intensively before surgery, with all the measures already well established 
for stable COPD patients who are not about to have surgery. The presence of comorbid conditions, especially cardiac 
abnormalities, should be systemically assessed and treated before any major surgical intervention.  
 
Lung resection 
For lung resection, the individual patient’s risk factors should be identified by careful history  taking including physical 
examination, chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests. Although the value of pulmonary function tests 
remains contentious, there is consensus that all COPD candidates for lung resection should undergo a complete 
battery of tests, including  spirometry with bronchodilator response, static lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and arterial 
blood gases at rest.(1138,1139) COPD patients at high risk for surgical complications due to poor lung function should 
undergo further assessment, for example, tests of regional distribution of perfusion and exercise capacity .(1138,1139) 
 
The risk of postoperative complications from lung resection appears to be increased in patients with decreased 
predicted postoperative pulmonary function ( FEV1 or DLco < 30-40% predicted) or exercise capacity (peak VO 2 < 10 
ml/kg/min or 35% predicted). The final decision to pursue surgery should be made after discussion with the surgeon, 
pulmonary specialist, primary clinician, and the patient. Surgery should be postponed if an exacerbation is present.

CHAPTER 4: MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATIONS  
KEY POINTS:  
• An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough 
and sputum that worsen over <  14 days. Exacerbations of COPD are often associated with 
increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other 
insults to the lungs. 
• As the symptoms are not specific to COPD relevant differential diagnoses should be 
considered, particularly pneumonia, congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism.  
• The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the 
current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events.  
• Short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short -acting anticholinergics, are 
recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation.  
• Maintenance therapy with long -acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as 
possible. In patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels 
addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen should be 
considered. 
• In patients with severe exacerbations , systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function 
(FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration. 
Duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days.  
• Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, 
treatment failure, and hospitalization duration. Duration of therapy should be 5 days.  
• Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.  
• Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD 
patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it 
improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases 
hospitalization duration and improves survival.  
• Exacerbation recovery time varies, taking up to 4 -6 weeks to recover, with some patients 
failing to return to the pre -exacerbation functional state. Following an exacerbation, 
appropriate measures for exacerbation prevention should be initiated (see Chapter 3). 
 
DEFINITION  
An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ECOPD) is defined as an event characterized by increased 
dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens in < 14 days which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or 
tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by infection, pollution, or 
other insult to the airways. (304)   
Considerations 
Exacerbations of COPD are important events in the management of COPD because they negatively impact health

 status, rates of hospitalization and readmission, and disease progression. (435,436) COPD exacerbations are usually 
associated with increased airway inflammation, increased mucus production and marked gas trapping. These changes 
contribute to increased dyspnea that is the key symptom of an exacerbation. Other symptoms include increased 
sputum purulence and volume, together with increased cough and wheeze .(1140,1141) Patients with COPD are at 
increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, (1142,1143) pneumonia,(1144,1145) pulmonary 
embolism(1146,1147) that may also mimic or aggravate an ECOPD. Thus, while worsening of dyspnea, particularly if 
associated with cough and, purulent sputum, and no other symptoms or signs in a patient with COPD may be diagnosed 
as an ECOPD, other patients may have worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic 
characteristics of ECOPD, that should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or 
contributors. In some patients one or more of these diagnos es may contribute to the clinical presentations and should 
be addressed appropriately ( Figure 4.1). 
 
 
 
Currently, exacerbations are classified after the event has occurred  as: 
 
► Mild (treated with short acting bronchodilators only, SABDs)  
► Moderate (treated with SABDs and oral corticosteroids ± antibiotics) or  
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   101 
 ► Severe (patient requires hospitalization or visits the emergency room). Severe exacerbations may also be 
associated with acute respiratory failure.  
 
The current grading of the severity of an ECOPD, based on post facto use of healthcare resources, is a major limitation 
of the current definition. Because of global variability in the available resources to treat patients and local customs 
affecting the criteria for hospital visits and admissions, there is substantial vari ability in reported ECOPD outcomes. (1148) 
Figure 4.2 shows a proposed clinical approach based on the current best available evidence .(304) 
 
 
 
It has been proposed that these easy to obtain clinical variables can help define the severity of exacerbations on point 
of contact (The ROME Proposal) .(304) Using The ROME Proposal for exacerbations, hospitalized patients with acute 
exacerbations can be further subclassified into mild, moderate and severe events with differences in mortality. (1149,1150) 
Based on a thorough review of the available literature and using a Delphi approach to agree on the variable thresholds, 
the severity classification is summarized in Figure 4.3. 
 
In the primary care setting, where laboratories may not be available, severity can be determined with the easily 
obtainable dyspnea intensity (using a VAS 0 to 10 dyspnea scale with zero being not short of breath at all and 10 the 
worst shortness of breath you have ever experienced), respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation level.  Where 
available, blood C-reactive protein (CRP) level is recommended. To determine the need for ventilator support (usually 
in the emergency room or hospital setting) arterial blood gases or equiva lent should be measured .  To move from a 
mild to a moderate level, three of the variables need to exceed the established thresholds.  It is hoped that prospective 
validation will help better define exacerbations and their severity at point of contact, and that documented validation 
may confirm or help modify the proposed thresholds of the variables now included. It is proposed that prospective 
research can help determine a more specific marker of lung injury than the more generic CRP,  as has been true for 
other organs acute events.

 It is now recognized that many exacerbations are not reported to healthcare professionals for therapy and yet these 
events, although often shorter in duration, also have a significant impact on health status. (1151,1152) Thus COPD patients 
need to receive education about the importance of understanding exacerbation symptoms and when to seek 
professional healthcare.  The WHO has defined a minimum set of interventions for the management of 
exacerbations.(742) 
 
Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory viral infections although bacterial infections and environmental 
factors such as ambient air pollution and excess heat may also initiate and/or amplify these events .(1153,1154) Short-term 
exposure to fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter is associated with increased hospitalizations , ER visits, 
and outpatient visits,(1154) as well as increased mortality  of COPD exacerbations.(1153,1155,1156) Another study also showed 
that short-term exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 w as associated with exacerbations in mild to 
moderate COPD patients .(101) The most common virus es isolated are human rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold) , 
influenza, para-influenza and metapneumovirus which can be detected for up to a week after an exacerbation 
onset.(1157,1158) When associated with viral infections, exacerbations are often more severe, last longer and precipitate 
more hospitalizations, as seen during winter. Filamentous fungi, particularly Aspergillus species, may be identified in 
sputum samples of patients during moderate  or severe exacerbations(1159-1161) although their clinical relevance remains 
unclear.  Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is rare (1.3 %-3.9%)(1162) and more frequent in patients with more severe 
baseline airflow obstruction, recent use of broad spectrum antibiotics or parenteral steroids, and 
hypoalbuminemia.(1163) Aspergillus sensitization is also a marker of increased risk of exacerbations .(1164) The diagnostic 
approach to invasive aspergillosis in this setting remains challenging .(1165) 
 
Exacerbations can be associated with increased sputum production and, if purulent, they are most likely due to 
bacterial infection(1141,1157,1166) There is reasonable evidence to support the concept that eosinophils are increased in 
the airways, lung, and blood in a significant proportion of people with COPD.(1167-1169) The presence of sputum 
eosinophilia has been related to susceptibility to viral infection. (1166) It has been suggested that exacerbations 
associated with an increase in sputum or blood eosinophils may be more responsive to systemic steroids (1170) although 
more prospective trials are needed to test this hypothesis. (1170) 
 
During a COPD exacerbation , increased symptoms are usually present for 7 to 10 days, but some events may last 
longer. At 8 weeks  up to 20% of patients will not have recovered to their pre -exacerbation state.(1171) COPD 
exacerbations contribute to disease progression ,(1172) which is more likely if recovery from exacerbations is slow. (1173) 
Exacerbations can also cluster in time and once they occur there is increased likelihood of  another event(439,1174) (see 
Chapter 2).  
 
Some patients are susceptible to frequent exacerbations (defined as two or more exacerbations per year), and these 
patients have worse health status and morbidity than patients with less frequent exacerbations. (436) The exact reason 
for an individual’s increased susceptibility to exacerbation s ymptoms remains largely unknown . However, the 
perception of breathlessness is greater in frequent exacerbators than infrequent exacerbators,(489) suggesting that a 
perception of breathing difficulty may contribute to precipitating the respiratory symptoms  rather than solely 
physiological, or causative factors. The strongest predictor of a patient ’s future exacerbation frequency remains the 
number of exacerbations they have had in the prior year. (439) It is recognized that these patients form a moderately 
stable phenotype, although some studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients change their 
exacerbation frequency especially with worsening FEV1.(1175)  
 
Other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of acute exacerbations and/or severity of exacerbations 
include an increase in the ratio of the pulmonary artery to aorta cross sectional dimension (i.e., ratio > 1), (301) a greater 
percentage of emphysema or airway wall thickness (1176) measured by chest CT imaging and the presence of chronic 
bronchitis.(169,1177)

 Vitamin D has an immune -modulating role and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of exacerbations. As with 
many chronic diseases vitamin D levels are lower in COPD than in health. Some, but not all studies have shown that 
supplementation in people with severe deficiency results in a 50% reduction in episodes and hospital 
admission.(896,1178) Therefore it is recommended that all patients hospitali zed for exacerbations should be assessed and 
investigated for severe deficiency (<  10 ng/ml or < 25 nM) followed by supplementation  if required. 
 
TREATMENT OPTIONS  
Treatment setting 
The goals of treatment for COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and 
prevent the development of subsequent events. (1179) Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity 
of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 
80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacologic al therapies including bronchodilators, 
corticosteroids, and antibiotics. (439,740,1180) 
 
 
 
The indications for assessing the need for hospitalization during a COPD exacerbation are shown in Figure 4.4. When 
patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with 
supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life -threatening and if 
increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non -invasive ventilation. If so, 
healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided . In less 
severe cases, the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to 
pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, 
ventilation). The management of severe, but not life threatening, exacerbations is outlined in Figure 4.5. 
 
The clinical presentation of COPD exacerbation is heterogeneous, thus w e recommend that in hospitalized patients  
the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient ’s clinical signs and recommend the following 
classification:(1181)

 No respiratory failure : Respiratory rate: ≤ 24 breaths per minute; heart rate < 95 beats per minute, no use of 
accessory respiratory muscles; no changes in mental status; hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen given via 
Venturi mask 24-35% inspired oxygen (FiO 2); no increase in PaCO 2. 
 
Acute respiratory failure  – non-life-threatening: Respiratory rate: > 24 breaths per minute; using accessory 
respiratory muscles; no change in mental status; hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask 
> 35% FiO2; hypercarbia i.e., PaCO 2 increased compared with baseline or elevated 50 -60 mmHg. 
 
Acute respiratory failure  – life-threatening: Respiratory rate: > 24 breaths per minute; using accessory 
respiratory muscles; acute changes in mental status; hypoxemia not improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi 
mask or requiring FiO 2 > 40%; hypercarbia i.e., PaCO 2 increased compared with baseline or elevated > 60 mmHg or the 
presence of acidosis (pH ≤ 7.25).  
 
 
 
Long-term prognosis following hospitalization for COPD exacerbation is poor, with a five -year mortality rate of about 
50%.(1182) Factors independently associated with poor outcome include older age, lower BMI, comorbidities (e.g., 
cardiovascular disease or lung cancer), previous hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations, clinical severity of the index 
exacerbation and need for long -term oxygen therapy at discharge. (1183-1185) Patients characterized by a higher 
prevalence and severity of respiratory symptoms, poorer quality of life, worse lung function, lower exercise capacity, 
lower lung density and thickened bronchial walls on CT -scan are also at increased risk for a higher m ortality following

 an acute COPD exacerbation. (1186) Mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. (1187) 
 
An updated Cochrane review concluded that the use of COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational 
component, in conjunction with ongoing support, reduced in -hospital healthcare utili zation. Such educational 
interventions were also found to increase the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and 
antibiotics.(1188)  
 
Key points for the management of all exacerbations are given in Figure 4.6.  
 
 
Pharmacological treatment 
The three classes of medications most commonly used for COPD exacerbations are bronchodilators, corticosteroids, 
and antibiotics.  
 
Bronchodilators 
Although there is no high -quality evidence from RCTs, it is recommended that short -acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with 
or without short-acting anticholinergics, are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of a COPD 
exacerbation.(1135,1189) A systematic review of the route of delivery of short -acting bronchodilators found no significant 
differences in FEV1 between using metered dose inhalers (MDI) (with or without a spacer device) or nebulizers to 
deliver the agent,(527,1190) although the latter may be an easier delivery method for sicker patients. It is recommend ed 
that patients do not receive  continuous nebulization but use the MDI inhaler one  or two puffs every one hour for two 
or three doses and then every 2 -4 hours based on the patient ’s response. Although, there are no clinical studies that 
have evaluated the use of inhaled long -acting bronchodilators (either beta 2-agonists or anticholinergics or 
combinations) with or without ICS during an exacerbation, we recommend continuing these treatments during the 
exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines 
(theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended to use in these patients due to significant side effects. (1191,1192) 
If a nebulizer is chosen to deliver the bronchodilator agent , air-driven bronchodilator nebulization is preferable to 
oxygen-driven in acute exacerbations of COPD in order to avoid  the potential risk of increasing the PaCO 2 associated 
with oxygen-driven bronchodilator administration .(1193)

 Glucocorticoids 
Data from studies (mostly hospital based)  indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten 
recovery time and improve lung function ( FEV1). They also improve oxygenation, (1194-1197) the risk of early relapse, 
treatment failure,(1198) and the length of hospitalization. (1194,1196,1199) A dose of 40 mg prednisone -equivalent per day 
for 5 days is recommended. (1200)  One observational study sug gests that longer courses of oral corticosteroids  for COPD 
exacerbations are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. (1201) Therapy with oral prednisolone 
is equally effective to intravenous administration. (1202)  Nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative for 
treatment of exacerbations in some patients, (1195,1203,1204) and provides similar benefits to intravenous 
methylprednisolone , although the choice between these options may depend on local cost issues .(1205,1206) Even short 
bursts of corticosteroids are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death (1207) and use 
should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less 
efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils (439,1167,1170,1208) and 
more trials of steroid -sparing treatment regimens are required . 
 
Antibiotics 
Although the infectious agents in COPD exacerbations can be viral or bacterial, (1158,1209) the use of antibiotics in 
exacerbations remains controversial. (326,1210,1211) The uncertainties originate from studies that did not differentiate 
between bronchitis (acute or chronic) and COPD exacerbations, studies without placebo -control, and/or studies 
without chest X-rays that do not exclude that patients may have had underlyin g pneumonia. There is evidence 
supporting the use of antibiotics in exacerbations when patients have clinical signs of a bacterial infection e.g., 
increased sputum purulence. (326,1211) Indeed the use of observed sputum color can safely modulate antibiotic therapy 
with no adverse effects if sputum is white o r clear in color. On the other hand observed sputum purulence has 94.4% 
sensitivity and 52% specificity for high bacterial load , indicative of a causative relationship .(326) 
 
A systematic review of placebo -controlled studies has shown that antibiotics reduce the risk of short -term mortality 
by 77%, treatment failure by 53% and sputum purulence by 44%. (1212) The review provides evidence to treat 
moderately or severely ill patients with COPD exacerbations and increased cough and sputum purulence with 
antibiotics.(1212,1213) These data are supported by more RCTs in patients with diagnoses of moderate COPD. (1214) In an 
RCT, the addition of doxycycline to oral corticosteroid an outpatient setting did not prolong time to next 
exacerbation.(1215) In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures are not feasible as they take at least two days and 
frequently do not give reliable results for technical reasons. Several biomarkers of airway infection are being studied 
in exacerbations of COPD that have a bett er diagnostic profile.  Earlier studies of C-reactive protein (CRP) have r eported 
contradictory findings. (1216,1217) A randomized trial found a marked reduction in antibiotic prescriptions without 
impaired outcomes in UK primary care outpatients with ECOPD in whom antibiotics prescriptions were guid ed by 
point-of-care CRP testing.(1218) Another trial in patients hospitalized for  exacerbations of COPD in The Netherlands 
found similar results (reduced antibiotic use with n o increase in treatment failure ). These findings need confirmation 
in other settings before a recommendation to generalize this approach.   However, data has indicated that antibiotic 
usage can be safely reduced from 77.4% to 47.7% when CRP is low. (1219) 
 
Procalcitonin is an acute phase reactant that increases in response to inflammation and infection  and has been studied 
to determine the use of antibiotics in COPD exacerbations.(1220)  The efficacy of this biomarker is controversial. Several 
studies, mainly done in the outpatient setting,  suggested that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment reduces 
antibiotic exposure and side effects with the same clinical efficacy .(1221-1223) A systematic review and meta -analysis  on 
the use of procalcitonin in hospitalized patients with a COPD exacerbation found no significant reduction in overall 
antibiotic exposure.(1224) In patients with COPD exacerbations treated in an ICU setting, the use of a procalcitonin -
based algorithm for initiating or stopping antibiotics was associated with a higher mortality rate when compared to 
those receiving standard antibiotic regimens .(1225) Based on these conflicting results we cannot recommend at this 
time the use of procalcitonin-based protocols to make the decision on using antibiotics in patient with COPD

 exacerbations; however, confirmatory trials with rigorous methodology are required.  
 
In summary, antibiotics should be given to patients with exacerbations of COPD who have three cardinal symptoms: 
increase in dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; have two of the cardinal symptoms, if increased 
purulence of sputum is one of the two  symptoms; or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). (1141,1158) 
A metanalysis demonstrated that ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment had the same clinical and bacteriological efficacy to 
longer conventional treatment in outpatients with COPD exacerbations. Furthermore, shorter exposure to antibiotics 
may decrease the risk developing antimicrobial resistanc e and complications associated with this therapy. The 
recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5 -7 days.(1226) We recommend a duration of ≤ 5 days of antibiotic 
treatment for outpatient treatment of COPD exacerbations. (1225,1227)   
 
The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. Usually , initial empirical 
treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline  or, in selected patients, quinolone . In 
patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction,(1228,1229) and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical 
ventilation,(1230) cultures from sputum or other materials from the lung should be performed, as gram -negative 
bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above -mentioned antibiotics 
may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient ’s ability to eat and the 
pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic, although it is preferable that antibiotics be given orally. Improvements in dyspnea 
and sputum purulence suggest clinical success.  
 
Adjunct therapies 
Depending on the clinical condition of the patient, an appropriate fluid balance, use of diuretics when clinically 
indicated, anticoagulants, treatment of comorbidities and nutritional aspects should be considered. Among COPD 
patients hospitalized with a  suspected exacerbation, up to 5.9% were found to have pulmonary embolism. (1146) 
Hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism(1231,1232) 
and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. (1233,1234) At all times, healthcare providers 
should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.  
Respiratory support 
Oxygen therapy 
This is a key component of hospital treatment of an exacerbation. Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve 
the patient’s hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88 -92%.(1235) Once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked 
frequently, or as clinically indicated,  to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or 
worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas (488) and in particular, may overestimate 
blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. (1236)  A study demonstrated that venous blood gas to 
assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment. (1237) Additional data 
are needed to clarify the utility of venous blood gas sampling to make clinical decisions in scenarios of acute respiratory 
failure; most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation, PCO 2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous 
compared to arterial blood samples and the severity of airflow obstruction was not reported.(1237) Venturi masks offer 
more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than do nasal prongs. (1135) 
 
High-flow nasal therapy 
High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) delivers heated and humidified air-oxygen blends via special devices (e.g., 
Vapotherm®, Comfort Flo®, or Optiflow®) at rates up to 8 L/min in infants and up to 60 L/min in adults. (1238) HFNT has 
been associated with decreased respiratory rate  and effort, decreased work of breathing, improved gas exchange, 
improved lung volume  and dynamic compliance, transpulmonary pressures and homogeneity. (1239,1240) These 
physiologic benefits positively improve oxygenation and clinical outcome s in patients with acute hypoxemic 
respiratory failure.(1239-1242) HFNT has been reported to improve oxygenation and ventilation, decrease hypercarbia and

 improve health-related quality of life in patient s with acute hypercapnia during an acute exacerbation, and also in 
select patients with stable hypercapnic COPD .(1239,1243-1245) However, the small sample sizes, heterogeneity of the 
patient populations and short duration of follow -up are current limitations in the interpretation of the value of HFNT 
for the COPD patient population at large. (1246) A meta-analysis, based on poor quality studies, showed no clear 
benefit.(1247) HFNT has been reported to improve oxygenation and ventilation, decrease hypercarbia, prolong the time 
to next moderate exacerbation and improve health -related quality of life scores in patients with acute hypercapnia 
during an exacerbation or in select patients with stable hypercapnic COPD receiving long term oxygen therapy. (1248) 
HFNT did not prevent intubation in a RCT conducted in patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation .(1249) It should 
be noted that European Respiratory Society ( ERS) Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend trialling NIV prior to use of 
HFNT in patients with COPD and hypercapnic ARF .(1250) There is a need for well -designed, prospective, randomized and 
controlled multicenter trials to study the effects of HFNT in people with COPD experiencing episodes of either acute 
or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  
 
Ventilatory support 
Some patients need immediate admission to the respiratory care or intensive care unit (ICU) ( Figure 4.7). Admission 
of patients with severe exacerbations to intermediate or special respiratory care units may be appropriate if adequate 
personnel skills and equipment exist to identify and manage acute respiratory failure. Ventilatory support in an 
exacerbation can be provided by either noninvasive (nasal or facial mask) or invasive (oro -tracheal tube or 
tracheostomy) ventilation. Respiratory stimulants are not recommended for acute respiratory failure. (1189)

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation  
The use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is preferred over invasive ventilation (intubation and positive 
pressure ventilation) as the initial mode of ventilation to treat acute respiratory failure in patients hospitalized for 
acute exacerbations of COPD. NIV has been studied in RCTs showing a success rate of 80 -85%.(641,1251-1254) NIV has been 
shown to improve oxygenation and acute respiratory acidosis i.e., NIV increases pH and decreases PaCO 2. NIV also 
decreases respiratory rate, work of breathing and the severity of breathlessness but also decreases complications such 
as ventilator associated pneumonia, and length of hospital stay. More importantly, mortality and intubation rates are 
reduced by this intervention. (1252,1255-1257) Once patients improve and can tolerate at least 4 hours of unassisted 
breathing, NIV can be directly discontinued without any need for a “weaning” period. (1258) The indications for NIV (1254) 
are summarized in Figure 4.8. 
 
Invasive mechanical ventilation  
The indications for initiating invasive mechanical ventilation during an exacerbation are shown in Figure 4.9, and 
include failure of an initial trial of NIV. (1259) As experience is gained with the generalized clinical use of NIV in COPD, a 
number of indications for invasive mechanical ventilation are being successfully treated with NIV, thus eliminating 
invasive mechanical ventilation as first line treatment of acute  respiratory failure during hospitalization for COPD 
exacerbation.(1259) In patients who fail non -invasive ventilation as initial therapy and receive invasive ventilation as

 subsequent rescue therapy, morbidity, hospital length of stay and mortality are greater. (641) The use of invasive 
ventilation in patients with very severe COPD is influenced by the likely reversibility of the precipitating event, the 
patient’s wishes, and the availability of intensive care facilities. (641) When possible, a clear statement of the patient ’s 
own treatment wishes, such as an advance directive or “living will”, makes these difficult decisions easier to resolve. 
Major hazards include the risk of ventilator -acquired pneumonia (especially when multi -resistant organisms are 
prevalent), barotrauma and volutrauma, and the risk of tracheostomy and consequential prolonged ventilation.   
 
Acute mortality among COPD patients with respiratory failure is lower than mortality among patients ventilated for 
non-COPD causes.(1260) Despite this, there is evidence that patients who might otherwise survive are frequently denied 
admission to intensive care for intubation because of unwarranted prognostic pessimism. (1261) A large study of COPD 
patients with acute respiratory failure reported in -hospital mortality of 17 -49%.(1262) Further deaths were reported 
over the next 12 months, particularly among those patients who had poor lung function before invasive ventilation 
(FEV1 < 30% predicted), had a non -respiratory comorbidity, or were housebound. Patients who did not have a 
previously diagnosed comorbidity, had respiratory failure due to a potentially reversible cause (such as an infection), 
or were relatively mobile and not using long-term oxygen, did well after ventilator support.  
Hospital discharge and follow -up 
The cause, severity, impact, treatment and time course of exacerbations varies from patient to patient and facilities in 
the community, and healthcare systems, differ from country to country. Accordingly, there are no standards that can 
be applied to the timing and nature of discharge. However, it is recognized that recurrent exacerbations leading to 
short-term readmission and increased all -cause mortality are associated with the initial hospitalization for an acute 
episode of deterioration. (1263)  
 
When features related to re -hospitalization and mortality have been studied, defects in perceived optimal 
management have been identified including spirometric assessment and arterial blood gas analysis. (1264) A systematic 
review has shown that comorbidities, previous exacerbations and hospitali zation, and increased length of stay were 
significant risk factors for 30 - and 90-day all-cause readmission after an index hospitali zation with an exacerbation of 
COPD.(1265) Mortality relates to patient age, the presence of acidotic respiratory failure, the need for ventilatory 
support and comorbidities including anxiety and depression. (1266) 
 
The introduction of care bundles at hospital discharge to include education, optimization of medication, supervision 
and correction of inhaler technique, assessment and optimal management of comorbidities, early rehabilitation, 
telemonitoring and continued patient contact have all been investigated to address these issues ( Figure 4.10).(1267) 
While these measures all seem sensible there is insufficient data that they influence either readmission rates or short -
term mortality(1264,1266,1268,1269) and there is little evidence of cost -effectiveness.(1266) One RCT showed that 
telemonitoring did not change hospitalization or exacerbation rates in people with COPD.(1270) Nevertheless, it remains 
good clinical practice to cover these issues before discharge and their effectiveness on health status and readmission 
rates may be increased if they are delivered with an approach that in cludes motivational interview -based health 
coaching.(964)

The only possible exception is early rehabilitation as there is some evidence that this factor is associated with increased 
mortality, although the reasons remain unknown. (1269) However, other data suggest that early rehabilitation post 
hospital discharge (i.e., < 4 weeks) may be associated with improved survival. (702) 
 
Early follow-up (within one month) following discharge should be undertaken when possible and has been related to 
less exacerbation-related readmissions. (1271) There are many patient issues that prevent early follow -up; those not 
attending early follow -up have increased 90 -day mortality. This may reflect both patient compliance, limited access to 
medical care, poor social support, and/or the presence of more severe disease. Nevertheles s, early follow-up permits 
a careful review of discharge therapy and an opportunity to make any needed changes in therapy . 
 
Additional follow-up at three months is recommended to ensure return to a stable clinical state and permit a review 
of the patient’s symptoms, lung function (by spirometry), and where possible the assessment of prognosis using 
multiple scoring systems such as BODE. (1272) In addition, arterial oxygen saturation and blood gas assessment will 
determine the need for long -term oxygen therapy more accurately at prolonged follow -up compared to shortly after 
discharge.(1273)  
 
CT assessment to determine the presence of bronchiectasis and emphysema should be done in patients with recurrent 
exacerbations and/or hospitalizations.(483,1274) A further detailed assessment of the presence and management of 
comorbidities should also be undertaken ( Figure 4.10).(1274)

 Prevention of exacerbations  
After an acute exacerbation, appropriate measures for prevention of further exacerbations should be initiated ( Figure 
4.6 and Figure 4.11). For the following treatment modalities significant effects on exacerbation risk/frequency could 
be shown in clinical trials. For details refer to Chapter 3. 
 
Based on findings from observational studies in various countries (1275-1278) there was a major decrease in hospital 
admissions for COPD exacerbations during the COVID -19 epidemic. It was hypothesized that this phenomenon may be 
a consequence of shielding measures (e.g. , wearing masks, avoid ing social contact, regular hand washing etc ). An 
alternative explanation is that patients may not have been seeking medical assistance during an exacerbation  due to 
concern about becoming infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If this was the case, then a corresponding increase in 
COPD related mortality  would be expected. However, two major studies from the US and the UK (1275,1279) did not report 
increased COPD associated mortality during the pandemic. Accordingly, shielding measures could be considered 
during the winter months (on top of established pharmacological and non -pharmacological measures) in patients at 
risk of exacerbation.

CHAPTER 5: COPD AND COMORBIDITIES  
KEY POINTS:  
• COPD often coexists with other diseases (comorbidities) that may have a significant 
impact on disease course.  
• In general, the presence of comorbidities should not alter COPD treatment and 
comorbidities should be treated per usual standards regardless of the presence of COPD.  
• Cardiovascular diseases are common and important comorbidities in COPD.  
• Lung cancer is frequently seen in people with COPD and is a major cause of death.  
o Annual low-dose CT scan (LDCT) is recommended for lung cancer screening in 
people with COPD due to smoking according to recommendations for the general 
population 
o Annual LDCT is not recommended for lung cancer screening in people with COPD 
not due to smoking due to insufficient data to establish benefit over harm  
• Osteoporosis and depression/anxiety are frequent, important comorbidities in COPD, are 
often under-diagnosed, and are associated with poor health status and prognosis.  
• Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and 
poorer health status.  
• When COPD is part of a multimorbidity care plan, attention should be directed to ensure 
simplicity of treatment and to minimize polypharmacy.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
COPD often coexists with other diseases (comorbidities) that may have a significant impact on prognosis. (305,462,463,1280-
1284) Some of these arise independently of COPD whereas others may be causally related, either with shared risk factors 
or by one disease increasing the risk or compounding the severity of the other. It is possible that features of COPD, are 
shared with other d iseases and as such this mechanism represents a link between COPD and some of its 
comorbidities.(1285,1286) The risk of comorbid disease can be increased by the sequelae of COPD e.g.,  reduced physical 
activity or continued smoking.  Whether or not COPD and comorbid  diseases are related, management of the COPD 
patient must include identification and treatment of its comorbidities. Importantly, comorbidities with symptoms also  
associated with COPD may be overlooked e.g., heart failure and lung cancer (breathlessness) or depression  (fatigue 
and reduced physical activity).   
 
Comorbidities are common at any severity of COPD (168) and the differential diagnosis can often be difficult. For 
example, in a patient with both COPD and heart failure,  an exacerbation of COPD may be accompanied by  worsening 
of heart failure or vice versa. Although COPD is negatively impacted by multiple comorbid diseases, COPD itself is one 
of the most important comorbid conditions that adversely affects the outcomes of other disorders. For example, 
patients with congestive heart failure or those undergoing cardiac procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting 
have greater morbidity and mortality when COPD is present compared to when it is absent. (1287,1288)

Below is a brief guide to the management of some common comorbidities occurring in people with COPD with stable 
disease. The recommendations may be insufficient for the management of all  COPD patients and are not a substitute 
for the use of guidelines for  the management of each individual  comorbid condition. 
Cardiovascular disease s (CVD) 
► A large primary care population study in COPD patients with no history of cardiovascular disease found a 25% 
increase in the adjusted risk of major adverse cardiac events including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
cardiovascular death. (1289) 
Heart failure 
► The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%,(1290) and its annual 
incidence is between 3-4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all -cause mortality. 
 
► Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically 
ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.(1291,1292)  
 
► Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure  and is recommended in patients with heart failure 
who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used , and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved 
cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. (892) 
 
► Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to 
support an alternative management strategy. N oninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves 
outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart 
failure with acute pulmonary edema. (1293) 
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD)  
► Ischaemic heart disease should be considered in all COPD patients depending on their risk factor profile. 
Cardiovascular risk may be assessed by the global risk calculator, which can be found on the US National Heart Blood 
Lung Institute website (1294) and treatment initiated based on the current recommendations.   
 
► During, and for at least 90 days after, acute COPD exacerbations there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events 
(death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, and transient ischemic attack) in patients at high risk of 
concomitant IHD.(1295) Hospitalization for an acute COPD exacerbation has been associated with 90 -day mortality of 
acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage .(1296) Patients who demonstrate abnormal 
cardiac troponins in isolation are at increased risk of adverse outcomes including short -term (30-day) and long-term 
mortality.(1297,1298) 
 
► The treatment of ischaemic heart disease should be according to guidelines irrespective of the presence of COPD 
and vice versa. 
Arrhythmias 
► Cardiac arrhythmias are common in COPD and vice versa.(1299) Atrial fibrillation is frequent and associated with a 
lower FEV1.(1300) 
 
► In COPD patients presenting with severe worsening dyspnea, associated atrial fibrillation is frequently documented, 
and it may be either a trigger or a consequence of an acute exacerbation episode. (1301)

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   116 
  
► The presence of atrial fibrillation does not alter the treatment of COPD. Bronchodilators have been previously 
described as potentially pro -arrhythmic agents;(1302,1303) however, available evidence suggests an overall acceptable 
safety profile for long -acting beta2-agonists,(1304) anticholinergic drugs (and ICS).(740,783,819,1305-1309) Nevertheless, caution 
is advised when using short -acting beta2-agonists(1304,1310) and theophylline, which may precipitate atrial fibrillation 
and make control of the ventricular response rate difficult. (1311-1313) 
Peripheral vascular disease  
► Peripheral artery disease (PA D) is commonly associated with atherosclerotic heart disease and may have significant 
implications for functional activity as well as quality of life in people with COPD.(1314)  
 
► In a large cohort of people with COPD of all degrees of severity, 8.8% were diagnosed with PAD that was higher 
than the prevalence in non -COPD controls (1.8%). (1314) 
 
► COPD patients with PAD reported a worse functional capacity and worse health status compared to those without 
PAD. Clinicians should consider PAD in people with COPD to those at risk for vascular events and to fully understand 
their functional impairments.   
Hypertension 
► Hypertension is likely to be the most frequently occurring comorbidity in COPD and may have implications for  
prognosis.(1285,1286) Diastolic dysfunction as a result of sub-optimally treated hypertension may be associated with 
exercise intolerance and mimic symptoms associated with an acute exacerbation thereby provoking hospitalization in 
COPD.(1290) These data stress the importance of optimal blood pressure control in COPD patients with underlying 
hypertension.(1315,1316) 
 
► Hypertension should be treated according to usual guidelines. There is no evidence that hypertension should be 
treated differently in the presence of COPD. The role of treatment with selective  beta-blockers is less prominent in 
recent hypertension guidelines  and there is no evidence that in people with COPD and increased cardiovascular risk  
cardio-selective beta-blockers either reduce  the benefits of treatment with  LABA or increase cardiovascular risk.(1317) 
 
► COPD should be treated as usual as there is no direct evidence that COPD should be treated differently in the 
presence of hypertension. 
Lung cancer 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from malignant disease worldwide, with more deaths from lung cancer than 
from colon, breast and prostate cancer together and it causes an estimated 1.6 million deaths worldwide each 
year.(1318) Unfortunately, the great majority of lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, resulting in poor 
overall survival.(1319) Therefore, primary, and secondary prevention and early detection are important to improve 
survival. There is evidence for an association between COPD and lung cancer that has been systematically confirmed 
in several epidemiological and observational cohort studies. (1286,1320-1322) These two diseases appear to share more than 
tobacco exposure as their common origin. Genetic susceptibility, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, local 
pulmonary chronic inflammation and abnormal lung repair mechanisms present in COPD are also thought to be the 
most important potential contributors to lung cancer development. (1323-1325) Whether the spirometric severity of 
airflow obstruction is directly or inversely associated with a greater risk for lung cancer development remains 
controversial.(367,1322) The association between lung cancer and degree of emphysema is stronger than that existing 
between lung cancer and degree of airflow obstruction and the greatest risk is observed in people with the 
combination of emphysema diagnosed by CT and airflow obstruction determined by spirometry. (1326,1327) The best 
preventive measure for lung cancer (as it is for COPD) is smoking prevention and in smokers, smoking cessation. (1328)

Several studies involving the use of low -dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) screening have shown improved 
survival.(395,396,1329)  The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its recommendation for lung 
cancer screening in 2021. (1330) Their recommendation was based on a systematic review that examine d the accuracy 
of screening for lung cancer considering the benefits and harms associated with lung cancer screening. USPSTF also 
commissioned collaborative modeling studies from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Intervention and 
surveillance modeling Network (CISNET) to provide  the optimal age to begin and end lung cancer screening, the 
optimal screening interval , and to assess the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies. The UPSTF 
now recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 -80 years who have a 20 -pack year 
smoking history and currently smoke or quit smoking within the past 15  years. They recommend stopping screening 
once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that subs tantially limits life expectancy or 
the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. Additionally, the CISNET modeling analys is supports screening 
at a younger age with a lower smoking burden to address current racial and gender disparities that exist with lung 
cancer screening.(1330-1334) In patients with smoking related COPD, annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT should 
be conducted in those 50 -80 years of age with a 20 -pack year smoking history who currently smoke, or who have quit 
smoking within the past 15 years. COPD has also been  reported to be an independent risk factor for lung cancer 
incidence in never smokers. (1335,1336) Risk factors include biomass fuel exposure, second -hand smoke, radon, air 
pollution, a family history of lung cancer, and asbestos exposure. Routine annual screening with LDCT has not been 
conducted in people with COPD who are never smokers and annual LDCT screening is not currently recommended 
because the possible harms of screening seem to outweigh the possible benefit of finding early lung cancer. (1337) 
 
Although this recommendation is supported by several major medical societies several important questions remain. 
Several studies have suggested that the yield of CT screening would improve if additional variables such as age, 
smoking history, BMI, presence of airflow obstruction and or emphysema and family history of lung cancer were added 
to the current screening cr iteria.(399,1338)  
 
The implementation of a screening program, where available, could be useful, but has to be implemented in the 
appropriate environment to avoid over diagnosis, greater morbidity and mortality with needless diagnostic procedures 
for benign abnormalities, anx iety and incomplete follow -up, as has been suggested by studies in primary care. (1339) On 
the other hand, one Danish study showed that being part of a lung cancer screening programme significantly promotes 
smoking abstinence(1340) and a review of different studies concluded that smoking cessation during LDCT screening 
results in improved spirometry as well as a decrease in micronodules seen on the baseline CT, thus beneficially 
affecting lung cancer and COPD. (1328) Smoking cessation interventions as part of CT scan screening programs could be 
of use (Figure 5.1).

 Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and lung cancer incidence 
ICS are recommended in selected people with COPD and their potential impact on development of lung cancer has 
been the subject of conflicting reports. Several retrospective analys es of large databases or observational cohorts (1341) 
have suggested a reduction in lung cancer risk with the use of ICS  but confounding factors have not been consistently 
controlled for in all studies .(1342-1347) A more pronounced protective effect of ICS was reported in former compared to 
current smokers,(1345) those with a concurrent diagnosis of asthma (1347) or, those prescribed a higher dose of ICS. (1346) 
A systematic review that included two observational studies and 4 RCTs, reported a protective effect of ICS on lung 
cancer risk in the observational studies that used a higher dose of ICS, but no benefit in the RCTs.(1348) An analysis 
designed to avoid immortal time bias (839) and an observational study (> 65,000 patients) reported no effect of ICS use 
on lung cancer incidence. (1349) In contrast, one database study reported an increased risk of lung cancer in patients 
prescribed ICS compared to those not prescribed ICS .(1350) Reports from large p rospective RCTs focused on lung 
function decline, exacerbation reduction or mortality, conducted in patients with moderate to severe COPD where 
cause of death was analyzed using clinical end -point committees reported no difference in cancer deaths in patients 
randomized to ICS versus non-ICS use.(448,566,697,740,819,1308) 
 
The conflicting results between observational and RCTs are probably due to differences in the patient populations, 
characterization of lung cancer risk, follow -up time (shorter in interventional trials), impact of immortal time bias, and 
the rigorousness used to detect lung cancer. Based on the available data  ICS do not appear to increase or decrease the 
risk of lung cancer pending studies adequately planned to clarify th ese important questions. 
Bronchiectasis 
► With increasing use of computed tomography in the assessment of people with COPD, the presence of previously 
unrecognized bronchiectasis is being identified. (1351) The prevalence of bronchiectasis in COPD patients has been 
analyzed in several studies with conflicting results ranging from 20% to 69% (mean prevalence was 54.3%) .(323) 
 
► Whether this diagnosis based on radiological criteria has the same impact as  a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis 
remains unknown at present . Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have compared the characteristics of COPD 
patients with and without bronchiectasis. The results indicated that people with COPD and comorbid bronchiectasis 
are more often male with a longer smoking history, greater daily sputum production, more frequent exacerbation s, 
poorer lung function, higher level of inflammatory biomarkers, more chronic colonization by potentially pathogenic 
microorganisms, higher rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation and increased mortality. (322,323) 
 
► Bronchiectasis should be treated according to usual guidelines.  
 
► Regarding COPD treatment, some patients may need more aggressive and prolonged antibiotic  therapy. ICS may 
not be indicated in patients with bacterial colonization or recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.  
Obstructive sleep apnea  & insomnia 
► COPD has an estimated prevalence in U.S. adults of 13.9% (1352,1353) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep 
disorder hallmarked by repeated episodes of upper airway closure, affects 9% to 26% of the U.S. adult population .(1354)  
 
► Patients with both COPD and OSA have a worse prognosis compared with either condition alone .(1355) During sleep, 
patients with both COPD and OSA suffer more frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation and have more total sleep 
time with hypoxemia and hypercapnia than OSA patients without COPD .(1356)  
 
► The apneic events in patients with combined OSA and COPD have more profound hypoxemia and more cardiac 
arrhythmias.(1357) Additionally, patients with combined COPD and OSA are more likely to develop daytime pulmonary 
hypertension(1358,1359) than patients with just OSA or COPD alone.

► The use of positive pressure ventilation in patients with COPD and OSA ha s been reported to reduce all - cause 
hospitalizations, emergency room visits, moderate and severe exacerbations and associated healthcare costs. (639,1360) 
 
► Insomnia in COPD is associated with higher rates of outpatients’ visits and hospitalizations. (1361) 
Periodontitis & dental hygiene  
The association between COPD and periodontitis has been noted mainly in the dental literature although whether this 
reflects common causative factors such as age, smoking and socioeconomic circumstances remains speculative. 
Although both conditions have a common (neutrophilic) relationship whether this reflects cause or effect is difficult 
to elucidate.(1362) In a more complete study the data supported shared pathophysiology between periodontitis and 
COPD with similar aberrant neutrophil function, especially when associated with alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency. (1363) 
 
The risk of developing periodontitis increases with the number of emergency room visits for COPD. (1364) High antibody 
levels to common periodontal pathogens is associated with less exacerbations of COPD. (1365) In a recent systematic 
review low to moderate evidence suggests that  periodontal treatment is associated with slower lung function decline, 
reduced frequency of exacerbations and less use of healthcare resources in patients with COPD and chronic 
periodontitis.(1366)  In the absence of an effective curative treatment for COPD it is difficult to prove the reverse is also 
true. 
 
Nevertheless, periodontitis is common in COPD  and often requires treatment in its own right which may lead to a 
reduction in exacerbations.  
Metabolic syndrome and  diabetes 
► Studies have shown that metabolic syndrome and manifest diabetes are more frequent in COPD and the latter is 
likely to affect prognosis. (462)  
 
► Insulin resistance has been associated with increased risk of COPD in women but not in men.(1367) 
 
► The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been estimated to be more than 30%. (1368) 
 
► Diabetes should be treated according to usual guidelines for diabetes.  COPD should be treated as usual.  
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)  
► GERD is an independent risk factor for exacerbations and is associated with worse health status. (439,1369,1370) The 
mechanisms responsible for increased risk of exacerbations are not yet fully established.  
 
► Proton pump inhibitors are often used for treatment of GERD . One small, single-blind study suggested these agents 
decrease the risk of exacerbation ,(1371) but their value in preventing these events remains controversial  most effective 
treatment for this condition  in COPD has yet to be  established.(1372,1373)  
Osteoporosis 
► Osteoporosis is an important and common comorbidity(463,1285) which is often under-diagnosed(1374) and associated 
with poor health status and prognosis.  
 
► Osteoporosis is often associated with emphysema, (1375) decreased body mass index (1376) and low fat-free mass.(1377) 
Low bone mineral density and fractures are commonly in COPD patients even  after adjustment for steroid use, age,

 pack-years of smoking, current smoking, and exacerbations. (1378,1379) 
 
► Osteoporosis should be treated according to usual guidelines.  
 
► COPD should be treated as usual despite the presence of osteoporosis. An association between  ICS and fractures 
has been found in pharmaco- epidemiological studies; however, these studies have not fully taken severity of COPD 
or exacerbations and their treatment into  account. 
 
► Systemic corticosteroids significantly increase the risk of osteoporosis and repeated courses for COPD 
exacerbations should be  avoided if possible 
Anemia  
Anemia is frequent in people with COPD, with a reported prevalence of 7.5% to 34%. (1380) People with COPD and 
anemia are generally older, have more frequent cardiometabolic comorbidities, greater dyspnea, worse quality of life 
and airflow obstruction, reduced exercise capacity, an increased risk of severe exacerbations and higher mortality.(1380-
1386)  
 
Anemia due to chronic disease  is the most common type seen in COPD, followed by iron deficiency anemia, (1387,1388) 
and is mainly related to chronic systemic inflammation and impaired iron utilization. However, other possible 
reversible factors should be investigated including use of long -term oxygen, theophylline, angiotensin -converting-
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor inhibitors, renal dysfunction, and androgens. (1389-1397)   
 
Although anemia has been established as an important comorbidity in COPD, optimal hemoglobin and hematocrit 
levels in these patients have not yet been defined, and it is also unclear whether its correction alters outcomes. 
However, hemoglobin assessment is advisable, particularly in more severely affected patients. If anemia is diagnosed, 
a systematic search for a treatable cause is recommended in accordance with appropriate clinical guidelines.  
Polycythemia 
Secondary polycythemia has long been recognized as a common comorbidity in COPD with a reported prevalence of 
6% to 10.2% in COPD outpatients (when defined as hemoglobin ≥ 17g/dL in males and ≥ 15g/dL in females). (1382,1384,1398) 
Interestingly, in the COPDGene cohorts 9.2% of men and 3.5% of women had secondary polycythemia .(1399) Although 
the prevalence of polycythemia in COPD has decreased following the introduction of long -term oxygen therapy 
(LTOT),(1400) one study reported a prevalence of 8.4% in patients with severe COPD receiving LTOT. (1383)  
 
Data from a large cohort (COPDGene cohort) of individuals with moderate to very severe COPD, indicate that male 
sex, current smoking, living at high altitude (e.g., Denver, Colorado, USA), impaired DLco, and severe hypoxemia were 
associated with increased risk for secondary polycythemia, whereas, LTOT use was associated with a decreased risk of 
polycythemia.(1399) The coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea has also been associated with increased risk of 
polycythemia in patients with COPD. (1401) Smoking causes an increase in carboxyhemoglobin, thereby increasing red 
blood cell mass and risk of secondary polycythemia in people with COPD. (1402,1403)  
 
Secondary polycythemia in COPD may be associated with pulmonary hypertension, (1404,1405) venous 
thromboembolism,(1405) and mortality.(1406,1407) However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, since 
secondary polycythemia may be related to the presence of severe uncorrected hypoxemia, which is a predictor of 
mortality in COPD, as well as to the presence of concomitant interstitial lung  disease or pulmonary vascular disease.  
 
In COPD, if secondary polycythemia is present, a careful evaluation should be performed to determine uncorrected 
hypoxemia or to rule out the presence of any comorbidities that require a specific intervention.

 Anxiety and depression 
► Anxiety and depression are important and underdiagnosed comorbidities in COPD (335,1408-1410) and both are 
associated with a poor prognosis, (1409,1411) younger age, female sex, smoking, lower FEV1, cough, higher SGRQ score, 
and a history of cardiovascular  disease.(42,335,1410) 
 
► There is no evidence that anxiety and depression should be treated differently in the presence of COPD.  
 
► COPD should be treated as usual  in patients with psychological disorders . The potential impact of pulmonary 
rehabilitation should be stressed as studies have found that physical exercise has a beneficial effect on depression in  
general.(1412,1413)  
 
► COPD is very common in patients with other psychiatric illnesses, often under -diagnosed and treated. (1414,1415)  
 
► A systematic review has shown that COPD patients are 1.9 times more likely to commit suicide than people without 
COPD.(1416) 
 
► Following a diagnosis of COPD patients are more likely to develop depression and the risk is greater in patients with 
worse breathlessness .(1417) 
Cognitive impairment  
► Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in people with COPD.(1418)  An average prevalence of 32% has been 
suggested.(1419) The prevalence and severity varies by the type of assessment. (1420) Extensive neuropsychological testing 
suggests that up to 56% of patients may suffer CI. (1421,1422) Longitudinal studies suggest greater risk of developing CI in 
COPD diagnosed in midlife, (1418,1423) and associate COPD with the development of dementia. (1424) 
 
► CI has been reported in patients across the entire range of spirometric severity. (1422) 
 
► CI has been associated with impairment in basic activities of daily living, (1425,1426) and variably associated with 
impaired health status. (1427,1428) 
 
► The coexistence of CI and COPD has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalization(1429) and increased 
length of stay during acute exacerbation hospitalization. (1430) 
 
► The impact of CI on self -management skills in COPD patients remains unclear, (1425) although  inhaler incompetency 
has been linked to CI. (1425) 
Frailty 
► Frailty can be defined as the presence of five components: weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low physical activity, 
and unintentional weight loss. (1431) 
 
► In a cohort study, the prev alence of frailty among individuals with COPD was higher than in individuals without 
COPD and may help identify people with COPD at risk of poor outcomes. (1432) 
 
► In a meta-analysis it was reported that frailty and prefrailty were associated with all-cause mortality, acute 
exacerbation, and hospitalization in patients with COPD.(1433) 
 
► The European Respiratory Society has published a review of current evidence on treating frailty in adults with

 chronic respiratory disease  and includes clinical management options such as geriatric care, rehabilitation, nutrition, 
pharmacological and psychological therapies .(1434) 
COPD as part of multimorbidity  
► An increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi -morbidity, defined as the presence 
of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients.  
 
► Multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most 
often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events.  
 
► There is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi -morbidity; however, it should be 
kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease. (464)  
 
► Treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often 
exposed to. 
Other considerations  
► Consider checking for vitamin D deficiency  in COPD patients.

CHAPTER 6: COVID-19 AND COPD 
KEY POINTS:  
• People with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or 
any other symptoms that could be COVID -19 related, even if these are mild, should be 
tested for possible infection with SARS -CoV-2.  
• Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as 
directed. 
• During periods of high prevalence of COVID -19 in the community, spirometry should be 
restricted to patients requiring urgent or essential tests for the diagnosis of COPD, and/or 
to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery.  
• Physical distancing and shielding, or sheltering -in-place, should not lead to social isolation 
and inactivity.  Patients should stay in contact with their friends and families by 
telecommunication and continue to keep active.  They should also ensure they have 
enough medication.   
• Patients should be encouraged to use reputable resources for medical information 
regarding COVID-19 and its management.   
• Guidance for remote (phone/virtual/online) COPD patient follow -up and a printable 
checklist are provided.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
For COPD patients the worry of developing COVID -19 as well as the effects of the pandemic on the basic functions of 
society and/or social services pertaining to their health impose d additional stressors to their condition.  The COVID -19 
pandemic made routine management and diagnosis of COPD more difficult as a result of reductions in face -to-face 
consultations, difficulties in performing spirometry and limitation in traditional pulmo nary rehabilitation and home 
care programmes.  Patients also faced shortage s of medication.(1435) Some health services are still working to catch up.  
 
The dramatic spread of the SARS -CoV-2 virus was accompanied by an enormous number of publications on the virus 
and its consequences.  Over time knowledge has grown, but the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 variants and the 
introduction of vaccines limits the interpretation of studies performed at earlier stages of the pandemic.  The 
statements made in this chapter utilize the published GOLD approach to data review and are based on the best 
assessment of the current evidence.    
 
RISK OF INFECTION WITH  SARS-CoV-2 
The spike protein of the virus binds to ACE2 (angiotensin -converting enzyme 2) during viral attachment to host cells 
and that viral entry is also facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). (1436) Differences in the 
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may modulate the individual susceptibility to and clinical course of SARS -CoV-2 
infection. ACE2 mRNA expression is increased in COPD, (1437-1439) and further increased in COPD patients with a higher

 BMI and more frequent exacerbations. (1440,1441) It may be modulated by ICS use. (1437,1442-1444) 
 
It is still not known definitively whether having COPD affects the risk of becoming infected with SARS -CoV-2.  Very few 
population studies using random sampling have assessed risk factors for testing positive for SARS -CoV-2, most have 
looked at samples of patients ref erred for testing or presenting with symptoms and very few contain information on 
comorbidities.  A comprehensive review compared the prevalence of COPD among COVID -19 populations to the 
country-specific populations in 16 countries worldwide wi th high quality data and found no significant differences in 
ten countries, a higher prevalence of COPD in 4 and a lower prevalence in two countries.(1445) Most studies of people 
in the community tested for SARS -CoV-2 have not shown chronic respiratory disease as an independent risk factor for 
testing positive,(1446,1447) although at least one has. (1448) 
 
Many studies reporting the comorbidities of patients admitted to hospital with COVID -19 have suggested a lower 
prevalence of COPD than would be expected from population prevalence ;(1449-1451) these findings are limited by small 
sample sizes and incomplete data on comorbidities. A large study with comprehensive data on comorbidities showed 
a high prevalence of COPD among those admitted (19%), (1452) although many patients had multiple comorbidities, and 
a further study of a primary care cohort of 8.28 million patients also showed having COPD was an independent risk 
factor for hospital admission (HR 1.55; 95%CI 1.46 -1.64).(1448) A systematic review, including only high quality studies 
from around the world, found that after accounting for confounding variables COPD patients were at slightly higher 
risk of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)  1.45; 95% CI 1.30,1.61).(1445) 
 
COPD has also been reported to independently increase the risk of severe disease or death in some series (1275,1451-1458) 
but not all.(1448,1459-1461) Globally, looking at high quality studies and after accounting for confounding variables, COPD 
patients were found to be at slightly higher risk of ICU admission (aOR 1.28 ; 95% CI 1.08,1.51), and mortality (aOR 
1.41; 95% CI 1.37,1.65).(1445) In patients with COPD, decreased lung function, higher CAT score, underweight, 
depression and prior COPD treated in inpatient or secondary care have been shown to be factors predicting severe 
COVID-19.(1462) 
 
Many factors have been proposed to account for the increased risk for poor outcomes including prior poor adherence 
to therapy, difficulties performing self -management, limited access to care during the pandemic and a reduced 
pulmonary reserve.(1463,1464) There is evidence of a fall in hospitalization rates for COPD during the pandemic. (1275-
1277,1465)  The reasons for this remain unclear, but patients experiencing symptoms of an exacerbation should be 
evaluated in the usual way during the pandemic and hospitalized if necessary.  
 
In multivariate analyses pre -existing COPD does not appear to increase the risk of patients developing long term 
symptoms post acute COVID .(1466,1467) 
 
There are currently no peer -reviewed studies that have evaluated the effect of smoking on the risk of infection with 
SARS-CoV-2, but studies suggest that smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and risk of death in 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients.(1468,1469) 
 
In summary, on current evidence, people with COPD do not seem to be at greatly increased risk of infection with SARS -
CoV-2, but this may reflect the effect of protective strategies.  They are at an increased risk of hospitalization for 
COVID-19 and may be at increased risk of developing severe disease an d death.

 INVESTIGATIONS  
Testing for SARS -CoV-2 infection 
People with COPD presenting with respiratory symptoms, fever or other symptoms suggesting SARS -CoV-2 infection, 
even if mild, should be tested for possible infection ( Figure 6.2). False-negative RT-PCR tests have been reported in 
patients with CT findings of COVID -19 who eventually tested positive with serial sampling. (1470) If people with COPD 
have been exposed to someone with known COVID -19 infection they should contact their health care provider to 
define the need for specific testing. Antibody testing may be used to support clinical assessment of patients who 
present late.  
 
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 does not exclude the potential for co -infection with other respiratory pathogens. (1471) The 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourage d testing for other causes of respiratory illness, in 
addition to testing for SARS -CoV-2 depending on patient age, season, or clinical setting.  
 
Some patients experience re -activation of long-lasting virus carriage or become re -infected, and this might be 
influenced by comorbidities or drugs that hamper the immune response. (1472) Repeat testing should be performed in 
patients with suspected recurrence or relapse of COVID -19. 
 
The lung microbiome is different in people with COPD compared to those without.(1473) The lung microbiome can 
modify the immune response to viral infections but, to date there is no direct evidence from human or animal studies 
on the role of lung microbiome in modifying COVID -19 disease(1474) nor on its potential effects in people with COPD. 
Spirometry & pulmonary function testing  
Performing spirometry and pulmonary function testing may lead to SARS -CoV-2 transmission as a result of coughing 
and droplet formation during the tests. (1475,1476) During periods of high prevalence of COVID -19 in the community, 
spirometry should be restricted to patients requiring urgent or essential tests for the diagnosis of COPD, and/or to 
assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. The ATS and ERS have provided recommendations 
regarding testing and precautions that should be taken. (1475,1476) Whenever possible, patients should have a RT -PCR 
test for SARS-CoV-2 performed and the results available prior to performing the test.  Patients with a positive RT -PCR 
test should normally have the test delayed until negative. As the prevalence of COVID -19 changes over time operating 
procedures should be reassessed and resumption of routine spirometry may be possible .(1477-1479) 
 
When routine spirometry is not available, home measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) combined with validated 
patient questionnaires could be used to support or refute a possible diagnosis of COPD. (375,1480-1482) However, PEF does 
not correlate well with the results of spirometry (1483-1485) has low specificity(343) and cannot differentiate obstructive 
and restrictive lung function abnormalities.  When making a diagnosis of COPD, airflow obstruction could also be 
confirmed by giving patients a personal electronic portable spirometers, (1486,1487) and instructing them in their use and 
observing them in their homes using video conferencing technology.  
Bronchoscopy 
In some people with COPD, diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy may be required. Elective bronchoscopy should 
be delayed until patients have a negative PCR test. (1488,1489) In urgent cases where COVID -19 infection status is 
unknown, all cases should be managed as if positive. A disposable bronchoscope should be used if available (1488) and 
staff should wear PPE.

 Radiology 
Chest radiography is insensitive in mild or early COVID -19 infection(1490) and is not routinely indicated as a screening 
test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. Chest radiography is indicated in people with COPD with moderate to 
severe symptoms of COVID -19 and for those with evidence of worsening respiratory status ( Figure 6.1).(1491) COVID-19 
pneumonia changes are mostly bilateral. (1492) Chest radiography can be useful for excluding or confirming alternative 
diagnoses (e.g., lobar pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion).  Point -of-care lung ultrasound can also be used 
to detect the pulmonary manifestations of COVID -19.(1493) 
 
 
 
Computed tomography (CT) screening may show evidence of pneumonia in asymptomatic individuals infected with 
SARS-CoV-2(1494) and false-negative RT-PCR tests have been reported in patients with CT findings of COVID -19 who 
eventually tested positive. (1470) Recommendations have been made on the use of CT as part of diagnostic testing and 
severity assessment in COVID -19(1491) and there are no special considerations for people with COPD. The initial features 
of COVID-19 on CT and their progression over time have been reviewed. (1495) COPD patients with COVID -19 have an 
increased prevalence of ground -glass opacities, local patchy shadowing, and interstitial abnormalities on CT compared 
with patients without COPD. (1496) A small case series of patients with emphysema and COVID -19 found that many had 
bilateral ground glass opacities with areas of consolidation; however, the pattern was variable and patients had more 
pronounced disease in the lung bases. (1497) 
 
The availability of CT may be limited by infection control requirements (1498) and where access to CT is limited, chest 
radiography may be preferred for patients with COVID -19 unless features of respiratory worsening warrant the use of 
CT. An increased occurrence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism has been repor ted in 
patients with COVID -19,(1499-1504) if pulmonary embolism is suspected chest CT angiography should be performed.

 PROTECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR PATIENTS WITH  COPD 
During periods of high prevalence of COVID -19 in the community p eople with COPD should follow basic infection 
control measures to help prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection including social distancing and washing hands  which are 
associated with reductions in the incidence COVID -19 (Figure 6.1).(1505) Wearing a mask or face covering can reduce 
the risk of spreading infection (source control). (1506) The efficacy of masks and respirators in protecting patients against 
infection are unknown but both surgical masks and N95 respirators were effective in preventing influenza -like illness 
and laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthcare workers. (1507) The American College of Chest Physicians, 
American Lung Association, ATS and COPD Foundation have issued a joint statement on the importance of patients 
with chronic lung disease wearing facial coverings at times of high COVID-19 prevalence during the pandemic.(1508) 
 
Wearing a tight-fitting N95 mask introduces an additional inspiratory resistance.  Respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen 
saturation and exhaled CO 2 levels were adversely affected in COPD patients wearing a N95 mask for 10 minutes at rest 
followed by 6 minutes of walking ;(1509) however, wearing a surgical mask does not appear to affect ventilation even in 
patients with severe airflow obstruction(1510) and overall the negative effects of using cloth or surgical face masks 
during physical activity appear negligible. (1511) In some countries where wearing face masks was compulsory in certain 
settings exemptions could be made for patients who are breathless and cannot tolerate wearing a mask ; however, 
whenever required people with COPD should try to wear masks.  In most cases, a looser face covering, or even a face 
shield may be tolerable and effective. (1512)  
 
The normal rules for patients on LTOT should be followed if air travel is planned, (1513) although patients should avoid 
travel unless essential.  Supplementary oxygen should be delivered by nasal cannula (1514) with a surgical mask be worn 
and distancing maintained  if appropriate. 
 
Shielding, or sheltering -in-place, is a way to protect people who are extremely vulnerable from coming into contact 
with coronavirus.  It is an alternative to full -scale physical distancing measures or lockdowns.  It was introduced in 
some countries for patients with severe COPD.  In the UK COPD patients were advised to shield if they had an FEV1 < 
50%, mMRC ≥ 3, a history of hospitalization for an exacerbation, or required LTOT or NIV.  Modeling suggests shielding 
was an effective strategy to protect indiv iduals and control the impact of SARS -CoV-2.(1515) If people with COPD are 
asked to shield it is important that they are given advice about keeping active and exercising as much as possible whilst 
shielded.  Plans should be made to ensure supplies of food, medications, oxygen, supportive health services and other 
basic necessities can be maintained . 
 
There are likely to be particular challenges in using shielding in low - and middle-income countries including the fact 
that many families will not be able to designate a separate room for high -risk individuals and may rely on the income 
or domestic support  that these individuals provide. (1516)  
Vaccination 
COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against SARS -CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, or an 
emergency department or urgent care clinic visit, including those with chronic respiratory disease .(561) People with 
COPD should have COVID-19 vaccination in line with national recommendations.

 DIFFERENTIATING  COVID-19 INFECTION FROM DAILY 
SYMPTOMS OF COPD  
Differentiating the symptoms of COVID -19 infection from the usual symptoms of COPD can be challenging.  Cough and 
breathlessness are found in over 60% of patients with COVID -19 but are usually also accompanied by fever (> 60% of 
patients) as well as fatigu e, confusion, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches and pains, anosmia, dysgeusia and 
headaches.(1452)  
 
In COVID-19 symptoms may be mild at first, but rapid deterioration in lung function may occur ( Figure 6.2). The 
prodrome of milder symptoms is especially problematic in patients with underlying COPD who may already have 
diminished lung reserve.  Lack of recognition of the prodromal symptoms may delay early diagnosis and preliminary 
data suggest that people with COPD reporting exacerbations and suspected of having COVID -19 infection were 
infrequently tested for its presence. (1517) A high index of suspicion for COVID -19 needs to be maintained in people with 
COPD who present with symptoms of an exacerbations, especially if accompanied by fever, impaired taste or smell or 
GI complaints.  
 
Persistent symptoms in people with COPD may cause diagnostic difficulty. A study found that only 65% of people had 
returned to their previous level of health 14 -21 days after testing positive for SARS -CoV-2.(1518) Some patients continue 
to experience cough, fatigue and breathlessness for weeks and a smaller proportion for months. (1518-1520) Delayed 
recovery was more common in people with multiple chronic medical conditions but was not specifically linked to 
having COPD.(1518) 
 
MAINTENANCE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT  FOR 
COPD DURING THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  
The use of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids has been controversial in the prevention and treatment of COPD during 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  ICS have an overall protective effect against exacerbations in COPD patients with a history 
of exacerbations (Chapter 3). However, there is an increased risk of pneumonia associated with ICS use, raising 
concerns that immunosuppression with ICS could increase susceptibility to infections in some individuals.  
 
Laboratory experiments show that corticosteroids reduce the production of anti -viral interferons (type I and III), 
increasing the replication of rhinovirus and influenza virus. (1521-1523) In contrast, other laboratory data show that 
corticosteroids and long acting bronchodilators can reduce the replication of coronaviruses including SARS -CoV-2.(1524) 
These laboratory experiments suggesting a potential protective effect of ICS against COVID -19 have not been validated 
by clinical studies.  
 
A systematic literature review identified no clinical studies in COPD patients concerning the relationship between ICS 
use and clinical outcomes with coronavirus infections including COVID -19, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
(MERS).(1525) A more recent study has shown ICS use in COPD was not protective and raised the possibility that it 
increased the risk of developing COVID -19(1526) but the results are likely to be confounded by the indication for ICS. (1527) 
A systematic review of more recent studies found no evidence that ICS use was associated with worse outcomes ;(1445) 
however the conclusions were again limited by similar confounding, lack of reporting of and adjustment for 
comorbidities, and studies with small sample sizes.  In people who do not have COPD, ICS use appears to reduce the 
risk of admission to hospital or d eath and reduce the duration of symptoms. (1528) There are no conclusive data to 
support alteration of maintenance COPD pharmacological treatment either to reduce the risk of developing COVID -

 19, or conversely because of concerns that pharmacological treatment may increase the risk of developing COVID -19.  
 
Similarly, there is no data on the use of long -acting bronchodilators, LAMA or LABA, roflumilast, macrolides in people 
with COPD and clinical outcomes/risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection; thus, unless evidence emerges, these patients should 
continue these medications required for COPD.  
 
 
Use of nebulizers  
Aerosol therapy increases the droplet generation and risk of disease transmission. Although most of the aerosol 
emitted comes from the device (1529,1530) there is a risk that patients may exhale contaminated aerosol and droplets 
produced by coughing when using a nebulizer may be dispersed more widely by the driving gas.  SARS -CoV-2 has been 
shown to be viable in aerosols for up to 3 hours (1531) and transmission to health care workers exposed to a hospitalized 
patient with COVID-19 receiving nebulized therapy has been reported. (1532)  If possible, pressurized metered -dose 
inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMI) should be used for drug delivery instead 
of nebulizers.  The risks of nebulized therapy spreading infection to other people in patient’s ho mes may can be 
minimized by avoiding use in the presence of other people, and ensuring that the nebulizer is used near open windows 
or in areas of increased air circulation. (1533) 
 
Nebulizers may be needed in critically ill patients with COVID -19 receiving ventilatory support.  In this case, it is vital

 to keep the circuit intact and prevent the transmission of the virus.  Using a mesh nebulizer in ventilated patients 
allows adding medication without requiring the circuit to be broken for aerosol drug delivery. (1534) 
 
PULMONARY REHABILITATION  
Many pulmonary rehabilitation programmes were suspended during the pandemic to reduce risks of spreading SARS -
CoV-2.  When case rates are high, cent er-based rehabilitation is not appropriate. Patients should be encouraged to 
keep active at home and can be supported by home -based rehabilitation programmes which, although likely to be less 
effective than traditional pulmonary rehabilitation with supervisi on (Chapter 3), are likely to be better than not 
offering rehabilitation.  Technology -based solutions, such as web -based or smartphone applications (975,1535) may be 
useful to support home rehabilitation . General principles of infection control should be applied and local guidance 
followed.(1536)  
 
REVIEW OF  COPD PATIENTS  
To minimize the spread of SARS -CoV-2 many health systems reduced face -to-face visits and introduced remote 
consultations using online, phone and video -links.  Routine review of people with COPD can be undertaken 
remotely(1537) and we have produced a tool to support these interactions that includes instructions on how to prepare 
for the remote visit, set the visit agenda with the patient, and provides a standardized checklist for follow -up (see 
section on follow-up at the end of Chapter 6). 
 
TREATMENT OF  COVID-19 IN PATIENTS WITH  COPD 
Randomized clinical trials of treatments targeting COVID -19 have focused on anti -viral agents and anti -inflammatory 
treatments. Some have produced positive results, including systemic steroids for hospitalized patients with severe 
COVID-19.(1538) The WHO has produced a COVID -19 therapeutics living guideline(1539) which currently recommends 
antivirals, corticosteroids, IL -6 receptor blockers and baricitinib for the treatment of COVID -19. The European 
Respiratory Society has also produced a living guideline on the management of hospitalized adults with COVID -19.(1540) 
Sub-group analysis of the effectiveness of these therapies in  COPD patients have not been presented.   
 
In the absence of subgroup data, we recommend that COPD patients suffering with COVID -19 should be treated with 
the same standard of care treatments as other COVID -19 patients (Figure 6.3). Furthermore, we advocate that COPD 
patients should be included in randomized controlled trials of COVID -19 treatments and that subgroup analysis of their 
outcomes are presented.

EXACERBATIONS OF  COPD 
The prevention and treatment of exacerbations are important goals in COPD management (Chapter 3).  COVID-19 
infection has introduced unique obstacles to the prevention and management of exacerbations. (1464) These include 
limited access to therapies due to their use for COVID -19 patients without COPD, disruptions in global supply chains 
and the inability of patients to afford medications due to economic hardships associated with the pandemic. (1464) 
Conversely, as countries went into lockdown and industrial activities shut down, pollutant emissions reduced 
substantially and environmental air quality improved. (1541) This could have contributed to the reported reductions in 
hospital admissions for COPD during the COVID -19 pandemic.(1276,1465,1542) 
 
Coronaviruses are among the respiratory viruses that trigger COPD exacerbations. (1543) To date MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV,

 and SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been reported in COPD exacerbations. Nonetheless, any COPD patients with SARS-
CoV-2 infection presenting with respiratory symptoms requiring changes in their maintenance medications would fulfil 
the definition of an exacerbation ( Chapter 4). Distinguishing the symptoms of a typical exacerbation from COVID -19 
infection can be extremely difficult as many of the symptoms overlap.  If COVID -19 infection is suspected, then RT -PCR 
testing should be conducted. If COVID -19 infection is confirmed, then treatment for COVID -19 infection should be 
conducted regardless of the presence of COPD.  
 
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a distinct pattern of pathophysiological changes including vascular injury, pneumonitis 
associated with hypoxemia, coagulopathy, high levels of systemic inflammation (“cytokine storm”) and multi -organ 
involvement.(1544,1545) These features are very different from typical COPD exacerbations. (1546) However, SARS-CoV-2 
infection may resemble an exacerbation of COPD.  Fever, anorexia, myalgias, and gastrointestinal symptoms are more 
frequently reported in COVID -19 than in exacerbations of COPD, whereas sputum production is less uncommon. 
Pronounced lymphopenia is a commo n finding of SARS-CoV-2 infection.(1501,1547) COPD patients who develop COVID -
19 reported more severe fatigue, dyspnea, and diarrhea than those without COPD. (1496) 
 
In patients with COVID -19 lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated D -dimer, C-reactive peptide (CRP), procalcitonin, 
creatinine kinase, transaminases, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are independently associated with 
higher risk of poor outcomes .(1548)  There is no reason to suspect that this is different in COPD patients with COVID -19 
(Figure 6.2).  
Systemic corticosteroids  
Caution has been raised about the widespread use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with COVID -19.(1549,1550) 
Observational studies in patients with SARS and MERS reported no association between systemic corticosteroids 
(often at high dose) and improved survival, but suggested that corticosteroids induced side effects, including 
osteonecrosis, and reduced viral cl earance.(1551-1554) The WHO initially recommended against the routine use of 
corticosteroids in COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the pandemic  except in two clinical settings: adult respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) and COPD exacerbations, where a specific indication for systemic corticosteroids was 
recognized.(1555)  
 
A large randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 has shown that dexamethasone treatment at 6 mg/day 
for up to 10 days reduced mortality in patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone.(1538)  
A small observational study has also reported that methylprednisolone use was associated with improved survival in 
COVID-19 patients with ARDS. (1556) Further studies have also reported the benefits of systemic glucocorticoids on 
reduction of mortality at 28 days in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia, especially those that are not on invasive 
mechanical ventilation or on pressor support. (1557) 
 
Systemic steroids should be used in COPD  exacerbations according to the usual indications (Chapter 4) whether or not 
there is evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection as there is no evidence that this approach modifies  the susceptibility to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection or worsens outcomes ( Figure 6.2). 
Antibiotics 
Antibiotic treatment for a COPD exacerbation is indicated if patients have at least two of the three cardinal symptoms 
including increased sputum purulence, or if the patient requires mechanical ventilation (Chapter 4).  
 
Bacterial co-infections have been reported infrequently in COVID -19.(1558) However, the risk of co -infections increases 
with the severity of COVID -19. Bacterial co-infections have been detected by multiplex PCR testing in up to 46% of 
samples collected in a small cohort of COVID -19 patients admitted to an ICU. (1559) Diagnosing co-infection in COVID-19 
patients may be difficult, particularly in critically ill patients, as the clinical presentation, biomarkers and imaging data

Be sure to read and understand the paragraph entitled Important Purpose & Liability Disclaimer                                   133 
 may be unhelpful. In practice, most hospitalized patients, particularly the severe ones, have been prescribed empirical 
antibiotic therapy.(1547)  Current WHO guideline s recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics in severe COVID -19 patients, 
guided by local/national guidelines, and in milder COVID -19 infections when there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial 
infection.(1555) In the absence of specific studies, these general considerations would also apply to people with COPD 
infected with SARS-CoV-2.   
 
Antibiotics should be used in COPD  exacerbations according to the usual indications (Chapter 4) whether or not there 
is evidence of SARS-COV-2 infection, particularly as people with COPD who develop COVID -19 are reported to more 
frequently develop bacterial or fungal coinfections. (1496) 
 
PULMONARY AND EXTRA -PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS  
ARDS may be part of COVID -19 and could be considered the major pulmonary complication of COVID -19(1560) with viral 
infection in areas of ongoing active injury contributing to persistent and temporally heterogeneous lung damage. (1561) 
Some early reports suggested that ARDS in this setting may differ from the typical ARDS. (1562,1563) Subsequent studies, 
however, suggested that classical ARDS also presented with a large variation in lung severity (1564) and there is 
considerable overlap between classical ARDS and COVID -19 patients.(1565,1566) Whether the long-term consequences of 
this form of ARDS differ from fibrotic lesions described previously is unclear. (1567,1568)  
 
Although the respiratory tract is the main target of COVID-19, extra-pulmonary involvement is frequent and 
contributes to morbidity, disability, and mortality. (1545,1569) Renal, cardiac, nervous, cutaneous, hepatic and 
gastrointestinal manifestations occur. (1570) It remains unclear, however, if these manifestations are directly caused by 
infection of SARS-CoV-2, or to secondary phenomena including inappropriate or overwhelming immune responses, 
angiopathy, treatment or ischemic damage due to the impairment of the respiratory functions. Concomitant 
respiratory comorbidities, such COPD, may aggravate these processes. Compared to lung viral load, lower levels of 
SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in the kidneys, liver, heart, and brain, (1571) suggesting secondary rather than primary 
involvement of these organs.  
Anticoagulation  
COVID-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state (1499) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) rates in both 
ICU and ward patients are 2 - to 4-fold higher than expected despite thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. (1572) People with COPD are already at increased risk of VTE (1573,1574) and 
those hospitalized with COVID -19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis ( Figure 6.2).  In response to the 
high rates despite prophylactics many institutional protocols have adopted intermediate -intensity (i.e., twice daily 
LMWH rather than once daily) or even a therapeutic -intensity dose strategy for thromboprophylaxis. (1575) Generally, 
LMWH is favored over unfractionated heparin to reduce staff exposure but clinicians should follow local guidelines on 
dosing and drug. 
 
VENTILATORY SUPPORT FOR COPD PATIENTS WITH 
COVID-19 PNEUMONIA  
The prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure in patients with COVID -19 was around 19%.(1576) Ventilatory support has 
been used in up to 20% of patients that develop severe hypoxemia due to COVID -19(1577) and approximately 5% of 
patients require ICU care and advanced respiratory support. (1578) Since the introduction of vaccination the rates of ICU 
admission have fallen. (1579) However, some patients still require ventilatory support and these individuals still have a

 high risk of mortality .(1454,1580,1581) COPD has been reported to increase the risk respiratory failure and ICU admissions 
in some, but not all studies. (1448,1453) 
 
There was wide variation (2.3% to 33%) in the early reported rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 
hospitalized patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID -19.(1582) This may, in part, 
have reflected differences in use of non -invasive ventilation (NIV) and high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), (1582) possibly as 
a result of advocation of early intubation during the pandemic’s initial phases because of concerns about viral 
dissemination.(1583,1584) Data supporting those concerns are lacking. (1585)   
 
Although early reports showed mixed outcomes, (1586) several studies have now shown showed HFNT significantly 
reduces rates of intubation and IMV, although with variable effects on mortality. (1587,1588) HFTN should be considered 
in preference to NIV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen therapy as it may have a 
lower failure rate.(1589-1591) Prone positioning has also been suggested for awake non intubated hypoxemic 
patients.(1592)   
 
NIV is the normal standard of care for COPD patients with acute respiratory failure ( Chapter 4). NIV may be beneficial 
for the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory in COPD patients with COVID -19 pneumonia, but it also has the potential 
to worsen lung injury as a result of high transpulmonary pressures and tidal volumes. (1593)  Patients on HFNT or NIV 
should be monitored closely for worsening and early intubation and IMV with adoption of a protective lung strategy, 
similar to that used in other forms of ARDS, considered. (1594,1595)  A PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg may be a useful indicator 
for NIV failure and increased risk of mortality. (1596) 
 
At the start of the COVID -19 pandemic, there was a reasonable rationale for using extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation ECMO in patients with very severe COVID -19-related ARDS, and r esults from large cohorts suggest 
outcomes during the first wave of the pandemic were similar to those in non -COVID-19 cohorts.(1582,1597-1603) As the 
pandemic continued, mortality of patients supported with ECMO has increased, possibly because of differences in 
patients referred for ECMO as a result of more widespread use of NIV and corticosteroids prior to intubation, changes 
in mechanical venti lation strategies and possible pathophysiological changes due to emerging viral variants. (1604) 
Indications in COVID -19 remain similar to indications for other causes of ARDS (1605,1606) and ECMO should be considered 
only after other strategies fail to achieve goals of oxygenation or ventilation. (1600,1601,1603) 
 
Aerosol generation can occur when any form of additional pressures or flows are applied to the upper or lower 
respiratory tract.(1607) Data regarding aerosol dispersion with the use of NIV is limited and contradictory ;(1530,1607-1609) 
however, staff should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (1591,1610) and viral filters fitted to exhalation 
ports of invasive or noninvasive ventilation devices.  Isolation hoods have also been suggested by some to be used to 
further decrease staff exposure. (1611) 
 
REHABILITATION  
COPD patients with COVID-19 are particularly at risk for poor nutritional status and skeletal muscle loss.(334) Hospital 
treatment should therefore include dietary support and early mobilization. Mechanical ventilation, sedation, and 
prolonged bed rest, may lead to post -traumatic stress disorder (1612) and respiratory, cognitive, and mental health 
impairments as well as physical deconditioning. (1613,1614) Older people and people with COPD, are more susceptible to 
these consequences. (1615,1616) 
 
Rehabilitation should be provided to all COPD patients with COVID -19, particularly to those that have been more 
severely affected or required ICU admission. A multinational task force has recommended early rehabilitation during

 the hospital admission and the screening for traits treatable with rehabilitation in all patients at discharge, and at 6 -8 
weeks after discharge for patients with severe COVID -19.(1617) 
 
FOLLOW-UP OF COPD PATIENTS WHO DEVELOPED  
COVID-19 
Several organizations have developed guidelines to address the evaluation and management of patients recovering 
from COVID-19(1519,1617-1620) but none of these have specific recommendations for patients with underlying COPD.  
Assessment protocols generally include a comprehensive physical, cognitive, and psychological assessment and there 
is no reason why these should not also apply to patients  with COPD; however. high quality data on the outcomes of 
these evaluation and management strategies are still lacking.  
 
The intensity of the monitoring of people with COPD who developed COVID -19 should be determined by the severity 
of the initial episode. 
 
Patients who developed mild COVID -19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for COPD patients ( Chapter 
3).  Patients who developed moderate COVID -19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, 
should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual COPD patients with particular attention to the 
need for oxygen therapy.  
 
One year after COVID -19 one third of patients have residual CT abnormalities ,(1621) with ground-glass opacities and 
fibrotic-like changes seen in 20% of patients, but no specific data are available on patients with COPD.  The frequency 
of CT abnormalities was higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (38% vs. 21%).  Gradual 
improvement is seen on CT over time but fibrotic changes showed little improvement between  4-7 months and one 
year after COVID-19. If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X -ray, possibly a CT 
scan should be considered at 6 months to one year.  Complications occurring during/after the COVID -19 episode 
should also be monitored.  
 
COPD patients are at higher risk of developing severe COVID -19(1594,1622) and multimorbid survivors frequently have 
required prolonged ICU stays. (1594) Until we have evidence from prospective studies, COPD survivors of severe COVID -
19 should be considered at high risk of developing a “critical illness” (1623) or “chronic critical illness”, (1624) a severe 
heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the underlying conditions before 
they became severely ill. (1614) 
 
There are informative candidate models for the comprehensive management of complex care delivery that are already 
published and undergoing study in the primary care setting, and these may be adapted for application after 
COVID-19.(1625)

 REMOTE COPD PATIENT FOLLOW -UP 
Introduction 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recognized that 
there was a need for developing new approaches to interact with COPD patients. Remote consultations are superb 
tools to minimize the risk of transmitting coronavirus and will be necessary for some time. The systems put in place to 
facilitate remote consultations sho uld also help increase the efficiency and capacity of the health care system into the 
future.(1626)  
 
In this short document, GOLD provides guidance to support the remote interaction with COPD patients who are usually 
seen in primary or secondary care. The tool includes instructions on how i) to prepare for the remote visit; ii) to set up 
the visit agenda with the patient; and iii) provides a standardized checklist for follow -up of COPD patients whether in -
person, by phone or in a virtual/online setting.  
 
The principles of good record keeping and clinical practice should always apply: i) treat patients with dignity; ii) respect 
people’s right to privacy and confidentiality; iii) listen to the patient’s needs and act in their best interest; and iv) bas e 
your recommendations on the best available evidence.  
Triage and prioritizing process  
The process of triage should help decide: a.) whether to offer an in -person as opposed to a remote (telephone or 
virtual/online) consultation, and b.) who to prioritize.  
 
Remote follow-up could be considered in the following situations:  
► Patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly;  
► Regular COPD follow -up or patient followed for a known condition;  
► Medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals;  
► Prescription and access to medication is possible and follow -up to the prescription can be arranged if 
necessary. 
 
In-person follow-up should be prioritized in these situations:  
► Patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information;  
► Patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms;  
► Changes in patient’s symptoms require a differential diagnosis work -up with the need for a physical exam 
and/or laboratory testing;  
► Patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. 
 
Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden 
and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant 
comorbidities, age, and/or l iving alone at home.  
Consideration and instruction for remote COPD follow -up 
Ensure documentation of the whole visit (in writing) as you would normally do for an in -person follow-up. The 
documentation should reflect that this is a remote follow -up (telephone or virtual/online) and should be specific about 
how the information was ob tained.

hand local numbers where the patient can be referred to for testing and treatment.  
b. If the patient has already been tested identify when the results will be obtained, or whether the 
result was positive or negative. If positive, is there a follow -up test planned, and dates.  
c. Verify patient is practicing COVID -19 precautions (face masks, hand washing, social distancing, or 
shielding if necessary).  
4. Section 3 – Action Plan 
a. Describe if the patient already has a written action plan. See example of an action plan from the 
Living well with COPD program [1]. Describe if the education for this action plan has already been 
done. Describe if the written action plan includes a prescr iption to be self-administered at home or 
whether the patient need to call his contact person / physician to obtain the prescription. Describe 
when it was used the last time and if used appropriately.  
5. Section 4 – Recent Admissions and ER visits  
a. Write down recent admissions and ER visits, dates and where they took place.  
6. Section 5 – COPD Self-Management behaviors  
a. Go over each of the self-management behaviors described in the list. You should cover what is 
pertinent to the patient treatable traits (dyspnea and/or exacerbation) [2]. Describe whether the 
patient has integrated these strategies in their daily life (yes), not at all (e.g. , it has not been 
discussed or not applicable), and whether the patient is unsure “ cannot tell”. 
7. Section 6 – Main issues 
a. Identify with the patient the main issues of the call. Up to a maximum of 3 items that can be covered 
for the duration of the call. Avoid cover ing too many issues in one visit.  
8. Section 7 – Summary, Intervention and Plan  
a. Finalize by describing the interventions done during the remote visit, the ones to be put in place, and 
agreed by the patient, the plan, including whether the patient needs to be referred to other services, 
healthcare professionals, etc. and when the next follow-up will take place (describe whether will it 
be in-person or remote).
