Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers a 5-fold increased risk of 
stroke compared with patients without AF.1 The risk of 
AF-associated stroke is not homogeneous and depends on 
patients’ age and comorbidities, which have resulted in the 
development of clinical scores to aid stroke risk stratification and guide the use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) for stroke pre-
vention. Currently, the CHA
2DS2-V ASc (congestive heart fail-
ure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, 
female) score is recommended by guidelines for stroke risk strat-
ification in AF2,3 and has been shown to be better than the older 
CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, 
diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score for stroke risk stratification among Asian AF patients.
4
Because age is an important driver of ischemic stroke for 
AF patients,5 the CHA2DS2-V ASc scheme assigns 1 point for Background and Purpose—The age threshold for an increased stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation may be different 
for Asians and non-Asians. We hypothesized that a modified CHA2DS2-V ASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 
≥75, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, female) scheme, 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc, which assigned one point for patients aged 50 to 74 years, may perform better than CHA2DS2-V ASc 
score for stroke risk stratification in Asians.
Methods —This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which included 224 866 newly 
diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients. The predictive accuracies of ischemic stroke of CHA2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-
V ASc scores were compared among 124 271 patients without antithrombotic therapies. From the whole cohort, 15 948 
patients had a CHA2DS2-V ASc score 0 (males) or 1 (females), and 8654 patients had an mCHA2DS2-V ASc score 1 
(males) or 2 (females). The latter were categorized into 3 groups, that is, no treatment, antiplatelet therapy, and warfarin, and the risks of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were compared.
Results
—During a follow-up of 538 653 person-years, 21 008 patients experienced ischemic stroke. The mCHA2DS2-V ASc 
performed better than CHA2DS2-V ASc score in predicting ischemic stroke assessed by C indexes and net reclassification 
index. For 8654 patients having an mCHA2DS2-V ASc score of 1 (males) or 2 (females) because of the resetting of the age 
threshold, use of warfarin was associated with a 30% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a similar risk of ICH compared with nontreatment. Net clinical benefit analyses also favored the use of warfarin in different weighted models.
Conclusions
—In this Asian atrial fibrillation cohort, the mCHA2DS2-V ASc score performed better than the CHA2DS2-
V ASc and would further identify atrial fibrillation patients who may derive a positive net clinical benefit from oral anticoagulation.   (Stroke. 2016;47:2462-2469. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.013880.)

Chao et al  Modified CHA2DS2-V ASc Score and Stroke in AF  2463
patients aged between 65 and 74 years and 2 points for those 
aged ≥75 years.6 However, the age threshold for an increased 
risk of ischemic stroke for Asians may be lower than that of Caucasians.
7 For Asian AF patients with a CHA2DS2-V ASc 
score of 0 (males) or 1 (females) aged between 50 and 64 years, the annual risk of ischemic stroke was ≈1.78%,
7 which 
exceeds the threshold for the initiation of OACs; 1.7%/y), especially if non–vitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) are used (0.9%/y).
8 However, whether resetting the age threshold 
at 50 years could refine current clinical stroke risk stratifica-tion for Asian AF patients is unknown.
In the present study, we propose a simple, modified 
CHA
2DS2-V ASc (mCHA2DS2-V ASc) score by resetting 
the age threshold at 50 years. We hypothesized that the mCHA
2DS2-V ASc score may perform better than CHA2DS2-
V ASc score for stroke risk stratification in Asians. Second, we aimed to investigate whether the mCHA
2DS2-V ASc score 
could further identify AF patients who may derive benefits from OAC use among those patients with a CHA
2DS2-V ASc 
score of 0 (males) or 1 (females).
Methods
Database
The study protocol of the present study is similar to our previous 
publications.4,7,9–12 This study used the well-validated National 
Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) released by the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes. The National Health 
Insurance system is a mandatory universal health insurance program 
that offers comprehensive medical care coverage to all Taiwanese residents. NHIRD consists of detailed healthcare data from >23 mil-lion enrollees, representing >99% of Taiwan’s population. In this cohort data set, the patients’ original identification numbers have been encrypted to protect their privacy, but the encrypting proce-dure was consistent, so that a linkage of the claims belonging to the same patient was feasible within the National Health Insurance 
database and can be followed continuously. The large sample size 
of this database provided a good opportunity to study whether reset-ting age threshold at 50 years could refine clinical risk stratification for Asian AF patients.
Information about important comorbid conditions of each 
individual was retrieved from the medical claims based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We defined patients with a certain 
disease only when it was a discharge diagnosis or confirmed more 
than twice in the outpatient department. The diagnostic accuracies of important comorbidities in NHIRD, such as hypertension, dia-betes mellitus, heart failure, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have been validated before.
13,14 Information about the medications the patients used was 
retrieved from the NHIRD using the specific code of each drug reg-istered by physicians responsible for the treatment of the patients 
for the purpose of getting reimbursement from the National Health 
Insurance system.
Calculation of CHA2DS2-V ASc and 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc Scores
The CHA2DS2-V ASc score was calculated by assigning 1 point each 
for age between 65 and 74 years, history of hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, recent cardiac failure, vascular disease (myocardial infarc-
tion or peripheral artery disease), and female sex and 2 points each for 
a history of a stroke, transient ischemic attack, or age ≥75 years.6 The 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc score was calculated by assigning 1 point each for 
age between 50 and 74 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mel-
litus, recent cardiac failure, vascular disease (myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease), and female sex and 2 points each for a his-
tory of a stroke, transient ischemic attack, or age ≥75 years ( Table 1).
Study Cohort
From January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2006, a total of 224 866 
newly diagnosed AF patients aged ≥20 years were identified from NHIRD as the study population. AF was diagnosed using ICD-9-CM 
code (427.31). To ensure the accuracy of diagnosis, we defined 
patients with AF only when it was a discharge diagnosis or confirmed 
more than twice in the outpatient department.
9,10,15 The diagnostic 
accuracy of AF using this definition in NHIRD has been previously validated.
16,17
Among the study population, there were 124 271 patients who 
did not receive warfarin or any antiplatelet agents, including aspirin, 
clopidogrel, dipyridamole, and ticlopidine, in whom the diagnos-
tic accuracies of CHA2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores in 
predicting ischemic stroke were compared. Among the whole study 
population (n=224 866), 15 948 patients had a CHA2DS2-V ASc score 
of 0 (males) or 1 (females), and 8654 patients had a mCHA2DS2-
V ASc score of 1 (males) or 2 (females) because of the resetting of the age threshold. These were divided into 3 groups based on the anti-
thrombotic strategies, that is, no antithrombotic treatment (n=6114), 
antiplatelet therapy (1433), and warfarin (1107). A flowchart of the 
enrollment of the study cohort is shown in Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Definition of Clinical End Point and 
Calculation of Net Clinical Benefit
The principal clinical end point was the occurrence of ischemic 
stroke, with concomitant imaging studies of the brain, including 
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The accu-
racy of diagnosis of ischemic stroke in Taiwan’s NHIRD has been 
reported to be ≈94%.14 Another validation study also demonstrated 
that the diagnostic accuracy of ischemic stroke in NHIRD was high, with the positive predictive value and sensitivity of 88.4% and 97.3%, 
respectively.
18 The principal safety end point was the occurrence of 
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), necessitating admissions to intensive 
care units.
The net clinical benefit (NCB) for the use of warfarin or antiplate-
let therapy compared with no treatment was calculated using the for -
mula: (ischemic stroke rate on no treatment−ischemic stroke rate on 
anti-thrombotic therapies)−weighting factor×(ICH rate on antithrom-
botic therapies−ICH rate on no treatment).
The weighting factor reflects the relative impact, in terms of death 
and disability, of an ICH while receiving warfarin or antiplatelet 
agents versus experiencing an ischemic stroke while on no treat-ment.
19–21 The NCB with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was cal-
culated from rate differences and standard errors estimated using 
Poisson regression based on the weights from Singer et al,19 Connolly 
et al,20 and Lip et al.21 A positive NCB favors treatment (ie, warfarin) 
when compared with no treatment.
Statistical Analysis
After a test of statistical normality, data are presented as means and 
standard deviation or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous 
variables and as n (%) for categorical variables. Incidence rates of 
ischemic stroke and ICH were calculated from dividing the number of event by person-time at risk, with the 95% CI estimated by exact binomial probabilities. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were 
assessed using the Cox regression analysis.
We assessed the predictive accuracies of the CHA
2DS2-V ASc and 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores by calculating C indexes based on the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of these 2 scoring systems were com-
pared using DeLong’s test. The net reclassification index comparing 
the CHA
2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores was also calcu-
lated. All statistical significances were set at a P<0.05.
The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

Results
Baseline Characteristics of Study Patients
Baseline characteristics of the study cohort are shown in 
Table 2. The mean age of patients was 72.0±13.9 years, and 
54.3% were male. The median values (interquartile range) 
of the CHA2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores were 3 
(2–5) and 4 (2–5), respectively. Hypertension was the most 
prevalent comorbidity in 56.8% of patients.CHA2DS2-V ASc, mCHA2DS2-V ASc, and the 
Risk of Ischemic Stroke Among Patients 
Without Antithrombotic Treatment
During a follow-up of 538 653 person-years, 21 008 patients 
(16.9%) sustained an ischemic stroke with an annual risk 
of 3.9%. Both the CHA2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc 
scores were significant predictors of ischemic stroke with 
a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.167 (1.159–1.176) and 1.164 
(1.155–1.173) per 1 point increment of the CHA2DS2-V ASc 
and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores, respectively. The incidences 
(per 100 person-years) of ischemic stroke of patients stratified by CHA
2DS2-V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores are shown 
in Table 3. For score=0 in males or 1 in females, ischemic 
stroke rates using the CHA2DS2-V ASc score were ≈1.2 per 
100 person-years or with the mCHA2DS2-V ASc score, ≈0.46 
for males and 0.63 for females.
Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement shows the 
receiver-operating characteristic curves of CHA2DS2-V ASc and 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores in predicting ischemic stroke. The 
C indexes based on areas under the curve for the CHA2DS2-
V ASc and mCHA2DS2-V ASc scores in predicting ischemic 
stroke were 0.689 (95% CI 0.684–0.694) and 0.708 (95% CI 
0.703–0.712), respectively. The difference was statistically sig-
nificant in favor of the mCHA2DS2-V ASc score (DeLong test 
P<0.0001). The mCHA2DS2-V ASc score also improved the 
net reclassification index by 3.39% (95% CI 2.16%–4.59%) compared with the CHA
2DS2-V ASc score (P<0.0001).
Antithrombotic Strategies With a CHA2DS2-V ASc 
Score of 0 (Males) or 1 (Females), Having an 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc Score of 1 (Males) or 2 (Females)
Among 15 948 patients with a CHA2DS2-V ASc score of 0 
(males) or 1 (females), there were 8654 patients having an 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc score of 1 (males) or 2 (females) because 
of the resetting of the age threshold. The latter were divided into 3 groups based on the antithrombotic strategies, that is, no 
treatment (n=6114), antiplatelet therapy (1433), and warfarin (1107). The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH on warfarin and antiplatelet agents compared with no antithrombotic therapy 
are shown in Table 4.
Compared with patients without antithrombotic therapy, the 
use of antiplatelet agents was not associated with a lower risk 
of ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 [95% CI 0.94–
1.24; P=0.275]) but significantly increased the risk of ICH 
(1.77 [95% CI 1.29–2.41; P<0.001]; Table 4). For the patients 
receiving warfarin, the risk of ischemic stroke was lower com-pared with no antithrombotic therapy (adjusted hazard ratio of 
0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.84; P<0.001]), with no significant differ -
ence in the risk of ICH (0.95 [95% CI 0.61–1.46; P=0.804]; Table 4. Figure shows the cumulative incidence curves for 
ischemic stroke (Figure [A]), ICH (Figure [B]), and ischemic stroke/ICH (Figure [C]) in different treatment groups.
The results of NCB analyses for each treatment according 
to different weighted models are shown in Table 5. The NCBs 
were consistently positive for warfarin use and negative for antiplatelet drugs, irrespective of different weighted models 
used. The NCB for warfarin versus antiplatelet therapy was 
also positive, in favor of OAC.Table 1. Calculations of CHA2DS2-VASc and mCHA2DS2-VASc

Chao et al  Modified CHA2DS2-V ASc Score and Stroke in AF  2465
Discussion
In this nationwide study, we propose and validate a mCHA2DS2-
V ASc scheme because of the resetting of the age threshold 
for stroke risk stratification among Asian AF patients (specifi-
cally, Taiwanese Chinese). Our results demonstrate that the mCHA
2DS2-V ASc score performs significantly better than 
the CHA2DS2-V ASc score (using C indexes and net reclas-
sification index) and can further identify Asian AF patients 
who may derive benefits from stroke prevention. Second, we 
show that the use of OAC results in a positive NCB among AF patients aged 50 to 64 years with mCHA2DS2-V ASc score 
1 for males or 2 for females; in contrast, antiplatelet therapy 
resulted in a negative NCB.
Improved convenience and safety of NOACs compared 
with vitamin K antagonists have lowered the threshold for initiating OACs for AF patients for stroke prevention.
8 The 
tipping point threshold when balancing stroke reduction 
against serious bleeding for initiating OAC is a stroke rate 
of 1.7%/y when vitamin K antagonists are used or 0.9%/y with the NOACs.
8 The treatment threshold with vitamin K 
antagonist may even be lower with good quality anticoagula-
tion control, where a high time in therapeutic range (>70%) 
is achieved, given that a high time in therapeutic range is associated with best efficacy and safety related to vitamin K 
antagonists.
22–24
All clinical risk scoring systems have broadly comparable 
predictive value for identifying high-risk patients who sustain 
stroke events. Rather than a categorized approach to stroke 
risk stratification focusing on high-risk patients, a simple 
approach to thromboprophylaxis is to initially identify truly low-risk patients in whom OACs could be clearly omitted.
25 
The ability of a scoring scheme to identify AF patients who are truly low risk of ischemic stroke is an even more important 
issue in Asians because this risk among Asians may be much 
higher than that among Caucasians, as demonstrated in regis-try studies and randomized trials.
10,26–30
Indeed, the CHA2DS2-V ASc score has been shown to con-
sistently better than the older CHADS2 score in identifying 
low-risk patients, even among Asian patients.31 Take our previ-
ous study for example, among 25 286 Asian AF patients with a 
CHADS2 score of 0, the CHA2DS2-V ASc scores of these sub-
jects ranged from 0 to 3, and the annual risk of ischemic stroke can be as high as 4.47%.
4 However, the risk of ischemic stroke 
was still 1.15%/y for patients with a CHA2DS2-V ASc score of 
0, which is above the suggested threshold for the initiation of NOACs (0.9%/y).
8
In our previous study, we suggested that the age threshold 
in Asian AF patients for an increased risk (>1%/y) of isch-emic stroke could perhaps be lowered to 50 years.
7 Although 
the detailed mechanism(s) behind the higher risk of ischemic stroke for younger AF patients in Asians remained unknown, 
atherosclerosis may play a more important role of ischemic 
stroke in Chinese AF patients than in Caucasian patients. Indeed, China and other Asian countries are among the coun-
tries with the highest incidence of stroke,
32 and intracranial 
atherosclerosis is common among Chinese patients who expe-
rienced ischemic event.33 Further prospective studies are nec-
essary to investigate this issue.
In the present study, we further demonstrate that the 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc score (by giving 1 point to age 50–74 
years) could clearly identify Asians patients who were truly low risk for ischemic stroke. Indeed, the annual risks of isch-emic stroke for males with an mCHA
2DS2-V ASc score of 0 
and females with an mCHA2DS2-V ASc score 1 were 0.46% 
and 0.63%, respectively, and thus, OACs could be clearly omitted for this population. In contrast, the annual risks of ischemic stroke for males with a CHA
2DS2-V ASc score of 0 
and females with a CHA2DS2-V ASc score of 1 were 1.21% 
and 1.18%, respectively.Table 3. Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Untreated Patients

2.02%/y, and the use of warfarin was associated with a 30% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a similar risk of ICH ver -
sus nontreatment (0.25%/y with warfarin versus 0.27% for nontreatment). The observed low risk of ICH among war -
farin users in patients with a low CHA
2DS2-V ASc score in 
the present study is consistent with a previous report.34 The 
results of our NCB analyses also favored the use of warfarin 
compared with nontreatment (or aspirin), irrespective of dif-
ferent weighted models, whereas antiplatelet therapy had a negative NCB compared with nontreatment. Based on the 
results of NCB analyses, the number needed to treat with 
warfarin use ranged from 152 to 159 compared with non-
treatment and ranged from 77 to 101 compared with anti-
platelet drugs in different weight models. Because 54.3% of patients with a CHA
2DS2-V ASc score of 0 (males) or 
1 (females) would have an mCHA2DS2-V ASc score of 1 
(males) or 2 (females) in our cohort, using the mCHA2DS2-
V ASc score would approximately identify an additional 54 
people who may get benefits with warfarin use for every 
100 patients with a CHA2DS2-V ASc score of 0 (males) or 1 
(females) screened.
Based on the findings of the present study, we proposed an 
algorithm for stroke prevention using the mCHA2DS2-V ASc 
score for Asian AF patients (Figure III in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Asian AF patients with an mCHA2DS2-
V ASc score of 0 (males) or 1 (females) are truly low risk, and OACs could be clearly omitted. For male patients with 
an mCHA
2DS2-V ASc score ≥1 and female patients with an 
mCHA2DS2-V ASc score ≥2, OACs should be prescribed, and 
NOACs are the preferred option because the risk of warfarin-
related ICH and major bleeding is higher in Asians compared 
with non-Asians.35,36
Limitations
There are several limitations of the present study. First, the types of AF (paroxysmal or nonparoxysmal) were not avail-
able from this nationwide data set. Although the risk of stroke did not differ between patients with paroxysmal or nonpar -
oxysmal AF in previous studies,
37,38 recent analyses show 
that the risk of ischemic stroke was higher in patients with nonparoxysmal AF compared with those with paroxysmal 
AF.
39 However, current guidelines do not consider AF type 
as a determinant of OAC use in the presence of stroke risk 
factors. Second, the diagnosis of AF and occurrence of isch-
emic stroke were based on the diagnostic codes registered by the physicians responsible for the treatments of patients; 
nonetheless, the accuracy of diagnosis of AF and ischemic 
stroke in Taiwan’s NHIRD has been previously validated to 
be high.
14,16–18 Third, we do not have time in therapeutic range 
data available for the warfarin-treated patients, but despite this, a positive NCB was evident even with one stroke risk 
factor, consistent with prior studies.
21,40 Fourth, the NCB of 
each treatment was not analyzed based on randomized com-
parisons and does not account for drug costs, cost-effec-
tiveness, patient values, and preferences. Besides, the NCB model only included ischemic stroke and ICH, the most dev-
astating bleeding complication, and did not consider other 
bleeding events because the severity of other bleeding varied 
much and is difficult to be ascertained in the registry data-
base. Fifth, the age, CHA
2DS2-V ASc, and mCHA2DS2-V ASc 
scores of patients were determined using the baseline data at 
the enrollment and were likely to change during the follow 
up. However, it is a common limitation that was frequently existent in previous studies. The relationship between the 
dynamic changes of age and clinical risk scores and the risk 
of ischemic stroke has not been well investigated before, and 
it is an important issue that deserves more investigations. In 
the clinical practice, it is imperative to update the risk scores of AF patients, and the use of OAC should be determined 
accordingly. Furthermore, the strategies for stroke preven-
tion of each patient could also change during the long-term follow-up. However, the change of treatment could happen 
for patients within each treatment group, and the accumu-
lative incidence curve of ischemic stroke for the warfarin 
group was consistently different from that of patients without 
antithrombotic treatments or under antiplatelet agents during the whole study period, as shown in Figure (A). The pattern 
of antithrombotic treatments preceding ischemic stroke and 
ICH was broadly consistent to that used for categorization Table 4. Risk of Ischemic Stroke and ICH Stratified Based on the Strategies for Stroke Prevention Among Patients Aged

at the enrollment for >80% of the patients. Last, the present 
study only enrolled Taiwanese Chinese patients, and whether 
the results can be extrapolated to other populations in Asia remains uncertain. Also, whether our findings are applicable 
to Asian/Chinese subjects living in Western countries requires 
further large prospective studies.
Conclusions
In this Asian AF cohort, the mCHA2DS2-V ASc score, which 
assigned 1 point for patients aged 50 to 74 years, performed 
better than the CHA2DS2-V ASc score for stroke risk stratifica-
tion and would further identify AF patients who may derive a positive NCB from OAC among those with a CHA
2DS2-V ASc 
score of 0 (males) or 1 (females).
