Abstract RpoS, an alternative sigma factor of RNA
polymerase, regulates the expression of a great deal of
genes involved in stationary-phase survival and stressresponse. To identify the function of RpoS homologue in
Serratia marcescens FS14, in-frame deletion mutant of
rpoS was constructed. It was found that RpoS activates the
biosynthesis of prodigiosin in FS14 which is just opposite
to what was observed in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. We also
demonstrated that RpoS positively regulates the prodi-giosin production by activating the transcription of pig
cluster in FS14, and the transcription of pigcluster is
RpoS-dependent. Further study showed that the differencesin the promoters of pigclusters in FS14 and 39006 lead to
the different selection of the sigma factors and result in the
different regulation mechanisms. The -10 element and thespacer region between -10 and -35 elements of the pig
cluster in FS14 are vital for the RpoS recognition in FS14.

Prodigiosin is a kind of secondary metabolite usually
synthesized in the later stages of the bacterial growth
without deﬁned roles in the bacterial physiology, though it
was found to have anti-fungal/anti-bacterial and anticancerability [ 1–4]. Therefore, understanding how it is synthe-
sized and how it is regulated is necessary.
Prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster from Serratia
marcescens has been sequenced and studied thoroughly.
The pigcluster ( pigA-O ) coded for the enzymes to syn-
thesis the prodigiosin transcribes as a polycistronic mRNAby using a promoter upstream of pigA [1,4]. Besides the
biosynthetic pathway, the regulatory networks of biosyn-
thesis of prodigiosin have also been studied extensively[3–5].
Sigma factors ( rfactors) of RNA polymerase are a kind
of global regulators in regulating the synthesis of mRNA.Generally, bacteria contain a highly conserved r
70(RpoD)
which is in charge of the majority transcription during
general vegetative growth stage; and alternative rfactors,
such as rS(RpoS), r32(RpoH) and rE(RpoE), take over
the responsibility in various stress conditions[ 6,7]. RpoS,
encoded by rpoS , plays an indispensable role in cell growth
especially during the transition from exponential phase to
stationary phase and some other stress conditions [ 8]. In
addition to the regulations mentioned above, RpoS was
also found to positively regulate the T6SS expression,
bioﬁlm synthesis [ 9] and negatively regulate the production
of prodigiosin in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 (S39006) [ 7].
It has been reported that different rfactors recognize
and bind to different promoter sequences, especially the -10 and -35 elements [ 10]. RpoD-dependent promoters of
E. coli are well studied and the consensus sequences of -10
and -35 elements are TATAAT and TTGACA, respectivelySupplementary Information The online version contains

[11]. Studies have shown that RpoS has a very similar but
not identical -10 element as RpoD, the consensus -10
element of RpoS in E. coli is TATACT [ 12], the presence
of the conserved -13C in RpoS-regulated promoter isthought to prevent the productive interaction of RpoD
binding [ 13]. It was also reported that -10 element is
essential for functional promoter, because -10 elementstabilizes the initial binding of the RNA polymerase and
promotes enzyme isomerization to the functional form
[10,14]; On the other side, -35 element has little effect on
promoter activity [ 15]. However, as RpoS could also rec-
ognize the -10 element of RpoD, the -35 element shouldplay roles in the RpoS-dependent transcription [ 16].
Besides the sequence differences, it was also found that the
length of the spacers between -10 and -35 elements rec-ognized by RpoS and RpoD are different. In general, the
spacer of the RpoD-dependent promoter is 17 bp, while
that of RpoS-dependent is about 1–2 bp longer and rich inA/T [ 17].
To elucidate the function of the RpoS in S. marcescens
FS14, in-frame deletion mutant of rpoS was constructed.
It’s interesting to ﬁnd out that the prodigiosin production
decreased in the RpoS mutant which is just opposite to the
result reported in Serratia sp. 39006. Recently, Qin also
found that deletion of RpoS impaired the production of
prodigioson of S. marcescens 1912768R [ 18] but without
performing detailed investigation. To ﬁnd out the reasonwhy different Serratia strains regulate the biosynthesis of
prodigiosin in different regulation modes, detailed work
was performed in this study.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains, Plasmids and Culture Conditions
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 1.S. marcescens FS14 and its various
derivate stains were cultivated at 28 /C176C. Bacteria were
cultivated in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium or Glycerol-
peptone medium with 60 lgm l-1kanamycin when
needed.
Mutants Construction and Complementary Assay
The suicide plasmid pWDF [ 19] was used to construct the
in-frame deletion mutant of the rpoS gene and various
substitution mutants of -35 and -10 elements of the pig
cluster in the genome of FS14 and FS14 DrpoS . The primer
pairs used in construction are listed in Table 2. The genetic
complementation assay was performed by introducing thepMCC [ 19] derived plasmid containing rpoS with its native
promoter into the FS14 DrpoS and FS14.Prodigiosin Measurement
Production of prodigiosin from FS14, FS14 DrpoS ,
FS14DrpoS and their various derivates were measured [ 20]
as previously described from 6 to 72 h.
b-Galactosidase Assays
Wide type and various mutated pigpromoter lacZ fusion
strains were constructed to perform the b-galactosidase
assays, constructed plasmids were listed in Table 1.b-
galactosidase activities were measured as previously
described [ 19].
Results and Discussion
RpoS Activates the Prodigiosin Production in FS14
at the Transcriptional Level
To investigate the function of RpoS in FS14, in-frame
deletion mutant FS14 DrpoS was constructed. The most
obvious phenotype is that FS14 DrpoS lost its red color
compared with the red pigmented wild-type FS14, this is
just opposite to the result observed in S39006, in which the
deletion of rpoS resulted in the increasement of prodigiosin
biosynthesis [ 7]. The complementary assay with the mea-
surement of prodigiosin production of FS14 and various
derived strains conﬁrmed that RpoS activates the prodi-giosin production in FS14 (Fig. 1a).
As RpoS is a sigma factor which performs its function at
transcription, to investigate whether RpoS modulates theproduction of prodigiosin at the transcriptional level, b-
galactosidase activity under the control of the promoter of
pigcluster in the chromosome of FS14 and FS14 DrpoS
were measured, respectively. Figure 1b showed that the
transcriptional level of pigcluster kept at very low level in
FS14DrpoS while it increased dramatically after 6 h in
FS14, and the transcriptional level is consistent with the
production of prodigiosin (Fig. 1a). These results indicate
that RpoS activates the biosynthesis of prodigiosin at thetranscriptional level.
It was reported that RpoS modulates the biosynthesis of
the prodigiosin by repressing the transcription of pig
cluster in Serratia sp. 39006 [ 7], and prodigiosin could be
detected in early phase (about 5 h) and the production of
prodigiosin begins to decrease at about 12 h. The authorsproposed that the pigcluster is transcribed from a r
70-
dependent promoter in S39006 under the growth conditions
tested [ 7,20]. However, in our study, the transcriptional
level of pigcluster was very low at 6 h, and no prodigiosin
was detected at 6 h and production of prodigiosin increased
after growing for 12 h and reached to the highest level at356 Indian J Microbiol (July–Sept 2021) 61(3):355–363

stationary phase (Fig. 1a). As prodigiosin was reported to
be a secondary metabolite, RpoS is an alternative sigma
factor especially activated in the stationary phase and RpoSactivates the transcription of pigcluster in FS14, we pro-
posed that the transcription of pigcluster is RpoS-depen-
dent in FS14. Recently, Qin also found that the deletion ofRpoS impaired the production of prodigiosin of S. mar-
cescens 1912768R [ 18] and conﬁrm that RpoS positively
regulates the production of prodigiosin in S. marcescens
1912768R. Their result is consistent with our results.
To ﬁnd out the reason behind the different sigma factor
dependent transcriptional modes, the promoter sequences
ofpigcluster in FS14, 1912768R and S39006 and the
amino acids sequences of RpoD and RpoS were thenanalyzed, respectively.
Sigma Factors RpoS and RpoD in FS14 Share High
Identities with Those in S39006
Sequence alignment showed that the amino acid sequences
of RpoS in FS14 shares 91.6% identity with that of RpoS in
S39006 (99.7% and 99.6% with that in 1912768R and
E. coli , respectively); the amino acid sequences of RpoD in
FS14 shares 91.7% identity with that of RpoD in S39006
(100% and 99.8% with that of RpoD in 1912768R and
E. coli , respectively). Detailed analysis also showed that
the amino acid sequences of the r
2.4andr4.2regions of
RpoS and RpoD in FS14, S39006, 1912768R and E. coli
which directly interact with -10 and -35 elements arecompletely same (see Fig. S1-S2 in the Supplemental
material).
Recently study in S. marcescens 1912768R showed that
RpoS from several Serratia stains and E. coli K12 with the
promoter of S. marcescens 1912768R could restore the
biosynthesis of the prodigiosin in the RpoS mutant of1912768R [ 18], this indicates that the RpoS from these
strains functions similarly though there are some amino
acid sequences differences existed.
All above results and analysis implied that the regulation
difference of pigcluster between FS14 and S39006 may
not be caused by the differences in the sigma factors.
The Promoter Sequences of PigCluster in FS14
and S39006 are Quite Different
Besides the sigma factors, the other possibility causing the
regulation difference is the differences between their pro-
moters. To determine if this is the case, promoters of the
pigcluster in FS14, 1912768R and S39006, especially the -
10 and -35 elements were analyzed (Fig. 2). As shown in
Fig. 2, the -10 element, -35 region and the distance
between -10 and -35 elements of the pigclusters in FS14
and S39006 are all quite different (The -10 to -35 elements
of the FS14 and 1912768R are completely same, the
sequence of 1912768 was then not shown here.). The -10element of S39006 is TAAAGA while that of FS14 is
CAAACT, the -35 element of S39006 is TTGCAT while
that of FS14 is GCGCCT, and the spacer between the -10Table 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study

and -35 element of S39006 is 17 bp while that of FS14 is
20 bp. The pigcluster promoter sequence of S. marcescens
ATCC 274 (Sma 274) [ 3] are also shown here. The -10
element of pigpromoter in Sma 274 is identical to that of
FS14 while -35 element is somewhat different (TTGCCT);the length and the composition of the spacer are the same
as that of FS14. The regulation mode of prodigiosin is
unclear in Sma 274, however, the study showed that the
prodigiosin was produced after 6 h and prodigiosin pro-
duction increased after 12 h which is very similar to whatwas observed in FS14 indicating that transcription of pig
gene cluster in Sma 274 may also be RpoS-dependent.
Taking together of the prodigiosin production mode andpromoter composition of the pigcluster in FS14, we canconclude that the promoter of pigcluster in FS14 is RpoS-
dependent, and propose that the different regulationmechanism of prodigiosin production in FS14 and S39006
may be due to the differences between the promoters of pig
cluster.

If the difference of promoters is the case leading to the
regulation difference, as -10 and -35 elements play
important roles in sigma factor recognition [ 10,11], the

FS14 to those of S39006 may lead to the S39006 regulation
mode in FS14 or unrecognizable. To further verify whether
the promoter differences lead to the regulation difference
between FS14 and S39006, various pigpromoter -35 and -
10 region substitution mutant strains of FS14, including -10
element, -35 element, spacer and the whole -10 to -35
element region substitutions etc., were constructed, andvarious corresponding pigpromoter lacZ fusion constructs
were also constructed. The prodigiosin production and b-
galactosidase activities were measured respectively tocheck the relationship between the transcription of pig
cluster and the prodigiosin production.
Prodigiosin measurement showed that the prodigiosin
production of the -35 element substitution mutant FS14
pig-
S39006-35is almost the same as that of wild-type FS14 and
no prodigiosin was detected in both FS14 DrpoS and
FS14DrpoSpig-S39006-35(Fig. 3a).
These results indicated that the substitution of -35 ele-
ment of pigpromoter in FS14 to that in S39006 does not
affect the prodigiosin production in wild type FS14 andFS14DrpoS , which suggests that -35 element is not
important for the recognition of pigpromoter by RpoS in
FS14. These results also imply that the difference of
prodigiosin production between FS14 and S39006 does notcaused by the difference of -35 element.
Further b-galactosidase activity assay showed that no
obvious difference could be observed at the transcriptionallevel between FS14, FS14 DrpoS and their corresponding
substitution mutants (Fig. 3b). The fact that the transcrip-
tion level is consistent with the production of prodigiosinconﬁrms that -35 element is not important for the RpoS
recognition of pigpromoter in FS14.
The production of prodigiosin and the b-galactosidase
activity with the -10 element substitution constructs were
then measured. Obvious differences could be observed by
this substitution. Almost no prodigiosin could be detectedin the FS14
pig-S39006-10(Fig. 3c). Consistently, the tran-
scriptional level of pigcluster with the substituted -10
element decreased dramatically too (Fig. 3d). These results
indicated that the -10 element of pigpromoter is vital for
the RpoS recognition and the -10 element of the pigcluster
of S39006 could not be recognized by RpoS of FS14. So,our results not only conﬁrmed that the transcription of pig
cluster is RpoS-dependent, but also the -10 element of pig
cluster is essential for the recognition of RpoS, while-35 element is not in FS14 (Fig. 3). This could also explain
that strain 274 has same -10 element as FS14 while -35
element is not and support the hypothesis that the tran-scription of piggene cluster in 274 is RpoS-dependent
(Fig. 2).
An interesting phenomenon could also be observed, the
transcriptional level with substituted promoter in
FS14DrpoS is higher than that in FS14 (Fig. 3d) which
implies that the RpoD in FS14 DrpoS may take some

responsibility to transcribe the mutated pigcluster when
there is no RpoS existed, whereas both of RpoD and RpoSmay refuse to recognize and transcribe the pigcluster with
the substituted -10 element in the wild type FS14 which
implies that the cell is ﬁnely regulated.
The Length of Spacer Between -10 and -35 Element
ofPigCluster is Crucial for the RpoS Recognition
in FS14
As the length of spacer and curvature of the spacer between
-10 and -35 element is reported to be important for the
sigma factor’s recognition and the structural stability of
open-complex [ 17,21], to determining the role of the
spacer in the prodigiosin production, the spacer between -
10 and -35 element of the pigpromoter in FS14 (20 bp)
was then substituted by the corresponding spacer in S39006
(17 bp). The prodigiosin measurement showed that almostno prodigiosin could be detected in both FS14
pig-S39006-
spacerand FS14 DrpoSpig-S39006-spacer(Fig. 4a).
Transcriptional levels of pigcluster are also very low in
the spacer substituted mutants (Fig. 4b) and are consistent
with the production of the prodigiosin. These data not onlyindicated that the spacer of pigpromoter is also essential
for the recognition by RpoS or RpoD in FS14, but also
further conﬁrmed that the transcription of pigcluster is
RpoS-dependent as a RpoD recognized 17 bp spacer just
could not be recognized by RpoS in FS14.
Since the promoter of pigcluster of S39006 is RpoD
dependent, to test if the whole RpoD recognition sites (-10
to -35 elements, including spacer) of pigcluster in S39006
could be recognized by the RpoD in FS14, and further
make FS14 produce prodigiosin with the mode as S39006,
corresponding RpoS recognition region in FS14 wasmutated to the RpoD recognition region in S39006 to test
the prodigiosin production and pigcluster transcriptional

cluster ( d). The values are the means ±SD of the independent

level. As shown in Fig. 4c, no prodigiosin could be
detected in the FS14pig-S39006-35-spacer-10and FS14 DrpoS
pig-S39006-35-spacer-10, the transcriptional levels of pigcluster
in both FS14 and FS14 DrpoS (Fig. 4d) are also very low
and were similar with what was observed in -10 elementand spacer replacement mutants. These results indicate that
both RpoS and RpoD of FS14 could not activate the
transcription of pigcluster with the -10 to -35 element of
S39006, with the exception in FS14 DrpoS in which RpoD
may somewhat recognize it as there is no RpoS existed
(Fig. 3d). This result suggests the difference of RpoD
protein between FS14 and 39006 may contribute to the
discrimination of promoter recognition.
As sequence comparison showed that the region 2.1 and
4.2 are completely same, therefore, sequences of RpoD of
FS14 and S39006 were then compared more thoroughly.
Detailed sequence alignment showed that the region 1.1 ofRpoD in S39006 is different from that in FS14 (different
from that in E. coli too) (Fig. S1). As study has showed that
region 1.1 of the sigma factor plays roles in the opencomplex formation [ 22], RpoD in FS14 may not efﬁciently
form open complex and transcribe the pigcluster with -10
to -35 region of the pigcluster in S39006 (Fig. 4c, d). This
result implied that besides the promoter differences, the
sigma factors may also contribute to the regulation.
In short, in this study, we found that RpoS activates the
prodigiosin production at the transcription level, and con-
ﬁrmed that the promoter of pigcluster is RpoS-dependent
in FS14. It is the sequence differences of promoter of pig
clusters lead to the regulation difference of prodigiosin
production between S39006 and FS14. We also veriﬁedthat the -10 element rather than the -35 element and the
spacer between the -10 and -35 element of pigcluster are
important for the RpoS recognition in FS14. Our ﬁndingnot only provide insight into the regulation difference of
prodigiosin production between the S39006 and some other
Serratia strains, but also contributes to the understanding
of the recognition mechanism of RpoS. Moreover, our
results make us speculate that the recognition mechanism
of sigma factors is strain speciﬁc as different strains need to

adapt to their speciﬁc living environments. Furthermore, as
prodigiosin has many promising applications, understand-
ing more regulation mechanisms of prodigiosin biosyn-
thesis will contribute to the future prodigiosin productionin industry, though more thorough work is still needed to
be done to increase the production of prodigiosin in the
future.
