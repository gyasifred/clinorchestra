A 1991 consensus conference9developed initial definitions
thatfocusedonthethen-prevailingviewthatsepsisresultedfroma host’s systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) toinfection ( Box 1). Sepsis complicated by organ dysfunction was
termed severe sepsis , which could progress to septic shock,
defined as “sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despiteadequatefluidresuscitation.”A2001taskforce,recognizinglimi-tationswiththesedefinitions,expandedthelistofdiagnosticcri-teriabutdidnotofferalternativesbecauseofthelackofsupport-ing evidence.
10In effect, the definitions of sepsis, septic shock,
and organ dysfunction have remained largely unchanged formorethan2decades.
TheProcessofDevelopingNewDefinitions
Recognizingtheneedtoreexaminethecurrentdefinitions,11the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society ofCritical Care Medicine convened a task force of 19 critical care,infectiousdisease,surgical,andpulmonaryspecialistsinJanuary2014.Unrestrictedfundingsupportwasprovidedbythesocieties,and the task force retained complete autonomy. The societieseach nominated cochairs (Drs Deutschman and Singer), whoselectedmembersaccordingtotheirscientificexpertiseinsepsisepidemiology,clinicaltrials,andbasicortranslationalresearch.
Thegroupengagediniterativediscussionsvia4face-to-face
meetingsbetweenJanuary2014andJanuary2015,emailcorre-spondence,andvoting.Existingdefinitionswererevisitedinlightof an enhanced appreciation of the pathobiology and the avail-ability of large electronic health record databases and patientcohorts.
An expert consensus process, based on a current under-
standing of sepsis-induced changes in organ function, morphol-ogy, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation(collectively referred to as pathobiology), forged agreement onupdated definition(s) and the criteria to be tested in the clinicalarena(contentvalidity).Thedistinctionbetweendefinitionsandclinical criteria is discussed below. The agreement betweenpotentialclinicalcriteria(constructvalidity)andtheabilityofthecriteria to predict outcomes typical of sepsis, such as need forintensivecareunit(ICU)admissionordeath(predictivevalidity,aform of criterion validity), were then tested. These explorationswere performed in multiple large electronic health record data-basesthatalsoaddressedtheabsence(missingness)ofindividualelementsofdifferentorgandysfunctionscoresandthequestionof generalizability (ecologic validity).
12A systematic literaturereview and Delphi consensus methods were also used for the
definitionandclinicalcriteriadescribingsepticshock.13
When compiled, the task force recommendations with sup-
porting evidence, including original research, were circulated tomajor international societies and other relevant bodies for peerreviewandendorsement(31endorsingsocietiesarelistedattheendofthisarticle).

Ideally,these clinical criteria should identify all the elements of sepsis(infection, host response, and organ dysfunction), be simple toobtain,andbeavailablepromptlyandatareasonablecostorbur-den. Furthermore, it should be possible to test the validity ofthesecriteriawithavailablelargeclinicaldatasetsand,ultimately,prospectively. In addition, clinical criteria should be available toprovidepractitionersinout-of-hospital,emergencydepartment,and hospital ward settings with the capacity to better identifypatients with suspected infection likely to progress to a life-threateningstate.Suchearlyrecognitionisparticularlyimportantbecause prompt management of septic patients may improveoutcomes.

Variable Definitions
Abetterunderstandingoftheunderlyingpathobiologyhasbeen
accompaniedbytherecognitionthatmanyexistingterms(eg, sep-
sis,severe sepsis ) are used interchangeably, whereas others are
redundant(eg, sepsis syndrome )oroverlynarrow(eg, septicemia ).
Inconsistentstrategiesinselecting International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and ICD-10codes have com-
poundedtheproblem.
Sepsis
Thecurrentuseof2ormoreSIRScriteria(Box1)toidentifysepsiswas unanimously considered by the task force to be unhelpful.Changes in white blood cell count, temperature, and heart ratereflectinflammation,thehostresponseto“danger”intheformofinfectionorotherinsults.TheSIRScriteriadonotnecessarilyindi-cate a dysregulated, life-threatening response. SIRS criteria arepresentinmanyhospitalizedpatients,includingthosewhoneverdevelop infection and never incur adverse outcomes (poor dis-criminantvalidity).

Thetaskforcerecognizedthatnocurrentclinicalmeasuresreflecttheconceptofadysregulatedhostresponse.H owever,as noted
by the 2001 task force, many bedside examination findings androutine laboratory test results are indicative of inflammation ororgan dysfunction.
10The task force therefore evaluated which
clinical criteria best identified infected patients most likely tohave sepsis. This objective was achieved by interrogating largedata sets of hospitalized patients with presumed infection,assessing agreement among existing scores of inflammation(SIRS)

correlation with subsequent outcomes (predictive validity). Inaddition,multivariableregressionwasusedtoexploretheperfor-manceof21bedsideandlaboratorycriteriaproposedbythe2001taskforce.

By Delphi consensus process, 3 variables were identified
(hypotension,elevatedlactatelevel,andasustainedneedforvaso-pressor therapy) to test in cohort studies, exploring alternativecombinationsanddifferentlactatethresholds.Thefirstdatabase
interrogated was the Surviving Sepsis Campaign’s internationalmulticenterregistryof28150infectedpatientswithatleast2SIRScriteriaandatleast1organdysfunctioncriterion.Hypotensionwasdefinedasameanarterialpressurelessthan65mmHg,theonlyavailable cutoff. A total of 18840 patients with vasopressortherapy,hypotension,orhyperlactatemia(>2mmol/L[18mg/dL])after volume resuscitation were identified. Patients with fluid-resistanthypotensionrequiringvasopressorsandwithhyperlacta-temia were used as the referent group for comparing between-groupdifferencesintherisk-adjustedoddsratioformortality.Riskadjustmentwasperformedwithageneralizedestimatingequationpopulation-averagedlogisticregressionmodelwithexchangeablecorrelationstructure.
Risk-adjusted hospital mortality was significantly higher
(P<.001comparedwiththereferentgroup)inpatientswithfluid-
resistanthypotensionrequiringvasopressorsandhyperlactatemia(42.3% and 49.7% at thresholds for serum lactate level of>2 mmol/L [18 mg/dL] or >4 mmol/L [36 mg/dL], respectively)comparedwitheitherhyperlactatemiaalone(25.7%and29.9%mortality for those with serum lactate level of >2 mmol/L[18mg/dL]and>4mmol/L[36mg/dL],respectively)orwithfluid-resistanthypotensionrequiringvasopressorsbutwithlactatelevelof2mmol/L(18mg/dL)orless(30.1%).
