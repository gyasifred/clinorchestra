Objective: We validated prior emergency department (ED) assessments of the chest pain score acceler-
ated diagnostic pathway (EDACS-ADP) in Korean patients. This score is designed to discriminate patients
at a low risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) from those with a potentially more serious condi-tion.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 1273 patients who had presented at our ED with chest pain or
symptoms of a suspected coronary artery disease and who underwent coronary computed tomographicangiography from January 2017 to December 2018. These cases had been classiﬁed as low or high riskusing the EDACS-ADP. The primary outcome was a MACE onset within 30 days of presentation.
Results: Of the total study patients, 448 (35.2%) were classiﬁed as low risk by the EDACS-ADP and 5 cases
(1.1%) of MACE arose. Overall, 221 patients in the study population (17.3%) developed a MACE. The sen-sitivity, and negative predictive values of the EDACS-ADP were 97.7% (95% CI 94.8–99.3), and 98.9%
(97.4–99.5), respectively.
Conclusion: The sensitivity and negative predictive values for the EDACS-ADP were high in Korean
patients presenting at the ED. However, the MACE rate among low-risk patients is higher than that con-
sidered acceptable by the majority of ED physicians for patients that are to be discharged without further
evaluation. Further studies may be warranted for the successful application of the EDACS-ADP.

1. Introduction
The diagnostic uncertainty that can arise when assessing
patients with chest pain or symptoms of suspected acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) has sometimes resulted in unnecessary cardiac
testing, which is associated with emergency department (ED) over-
crowding, unnecessary hospital admissions, and increased health-
care costs [1]. It is reported that < 25% of all chest pain patients will
have an ACS [2], and that more than 50% of these cases receive a
diagnosis of non-cardiac pain [3]. Considering that a majority of
these patients do not have a life-threatening condition and will
not need to be hospitalized, emergency physicians need to accu-
rately discriminate them from other cases requiring urgent treat-
ment for potentially serious heart problems. In this regard,
several risk stratiﬁcation scoring systems for estimating the risk
of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) have been developed.
Recently, the Emergency Department Assessment of Chest painScore (EDACS) was developed using a two-stage development pro-
cess comprising a statistical model and improved clinical practical-
ity and usability. In addition, by combining electrocardiography
(ECG) and troponin data as its variables, the EDACS-accelerated
diagnostic pathway (ADP) was derived to identify cases with a very
low short-term risk of MACE that could be safely discharged from
the ED for further observation and management as an outpatient
only [4].
The EDACS-ADP items include age, sex, clinical features, ECG,
and troponin results ( Fig. 1 ). Unlike the EDACS which scores all 4
of these variables and classiﬁes patients as low or high risk based
on a reference point of 16, the EDACS-ADP identiﬁes patients as
low risk if all three following criteria are met: (1) EDACS < 16;
(2) ECG with no new ischemic changes; and (3) a negative troponin
level at 0 and 2 h after ED presentation. Otherwise, the patient is
classiﬁed as high risk in this system. Based on this protocol, it is
recommended that low risk individuals can be discharged safely
for early outpatient follow-up and that high risk cases be processed
for standard care in the hospital with further evaluation. The
EDACS-ADP was reported in its derivation and the ﬁrst validation
studies to identify up to 50% of patients in the ED with suspected

cardiac chest pain as low risk, enabling them to be safely dis-
charged within 2 h with a negative predictive value (NPV) of
99.7% [4]. Validation studies from New Zealand and Canada further
demonstrated very high sensitivities and NPVs for the EDACS-ADP
tool [4,5] . When evaluating the proportion of patients discharged
within 6 h of ED presentation and with no subsequent MACE
within 30 days, no difference was found between the 2 h ADP
based on the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score
(ADAPT) and EDACS-ADP, even though more patients were classi-
ﬁed as low risk by EDACS-ADP [6]. When the normal troponin con-
centration was incorporated as a variable, the original EDACS
showed the best performance by identifying the largest proportion
of patients as low risk (60.6%), compared with the modiﬁed His-
tory, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk factors and Troponin (HEART)
score and simpliﬁed EDACS [7]. However, a subsequent study of
US ED patients with acute chest pain reported that this score did
not maintain sufﬁcient sensitivity for MACE compared to the orig-
inal study ﬁndings [8]. The authors of that report suggested that
their results would stimulate debate on the acceptable rate of
missed MACE cases and justify further studies of decision rule
reﬁnement. Most ED physicians agree that a useful chest pain risk
stratiﬁcation score must not only have a <1% missed MACE rate,
but also a higher than 99% sensitivity [9].
There is little current evidence regarding the performance of
EDACS and EDACS-ADP among various population and clinical set-
tings. We therefore conducted our present investigation to assess
and validate the EDACS-ADP tool in a prior cohort of patients pre-
senting with possible cardiac symptoms in a Korean ED. We
assessed the performance of the EDACS-ADP in identifying patientswho were less likely to have a MACE, i.e. the low risk group, to gain
further insights into the clinical application of this scoring system.
2. Methods
To conduct an external validation of the EDACS-ADP, a retro-
spective review of the electronic medical records was done for all
patients who presented to the Asan Medical Center ED with chest
pain or symptoms of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD)
between January 2017 and December 2018. The current study pro-tocol was approved by the institutional review board of Asan Med-
ical Center, which waived the requirement to obtain informed
consent due to the retrospective nature of the analyses.
Our ED has an annual volume of approximately 120,000 patients
and serves as a tertiary referral center in Seoul, Korea. We used an
electronic data retrieval program in our institution. When using this
tool, we begin searching the eligible patients with their presenting
symptoms. If only the symptom ‘‘chest pain” were used, we thought
that a signiﬁcant number of patients with potential coronary artery
disease might be lost. Therefore, we included a wider range of
patients with possible cardiac symptoms including epigastric pain,
neck, jaw or arm pain, or discomfort or pressure as according to
American Heart Association case deﬁnitions [10]. In order to conﬁrm
that these symptoms are considered as a potential for coronary artery
disease, we narrowed the inclusion criteria to chest pain or possible
cardiac symptoms and undergone a coronary computed tomography
angiography (CTA). Patients were excluded from our present analysis
if they had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction at their ED

presentation, underwent a CTA for causes other than an ACS evalua-
tion, or had no blood drawn for troponin assays. In addition, patient
were excluded if their vital signs were unstable at presentation
because a low risk classiﬁcation via the EDACS-ADP in such instances
cannot exclude fatal cardiac causes and the protocol does not con-
sider vital signs when stratifying patients.
The data collected for the study patients included age, sex,
symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, and vital signs. New
ischemic changes on an ECG were deﬁned as a ST-segment depres-
sion of at least 0.05 mV in /C212 contiguous leads, a T-wave inversion
of at least 0.1 mV, or Q waves >30 ms in width and /C210.1 mV in
depth in at least 2 contiguous leads [11–14] . The cardiac troponin
I (cTnI-Ultra) assay was done using Siemens ADVIA Centaur with
the 99th percentile of 0.04 ng/mL used as the cutoff for evidence
of myocardial necrosis [15]. Per our institution’s standard practice,
follow-up cardiac troponins were ordered at 2–3 h intervals for
patients with a suspected CAD, and the troponin concentrations
measured at ED presentation and 2–3 h later were collected. Fol-
lowing the methodology used in the derivation study, when a vari-
able was missed, symptoms such as diaphoresis, pleuritic pain,
radiating pain, and pain induced by palpitation in the medical
records were considered negative to prevent a false increase in
sensitivity [4]. In the same manner, when follow-up troponin
levels were not available for the patients with no subsequent
MACE, they were considered normal.
Regarding risk factors, a known CAD was deﬁned as a previous
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and any coronary revasculariza-
tion including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) [4]. The counted risk
factors were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a cur-
rent smoking habit, and any family history of premature CAD [4].
The EDACS and EDACS-ADP were calculated from the medical
records, and the ECG, and troponin results. The calculated EDACS
score was ﬁrst divided at intervals of 5 points, starting from the low-
est point, to compare the MACE rate in accordance with the score.
The primary outcome was the occurrence of a subsequent
MACE including AMI, a revascularization procedure including PCI,
and CABG, and death from any cause within 30 days of the ED pre-
sentation [16]. AMI was deﬁned as described by the 3rd universal
deﬁnition of myocardial infarction [17]. When there was no docu-
mentation of MACE in the patient’s follow-up medical records or
record of death from a national health events search, we consid-
ered this case to be MACE-negative.
2.1. Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the mean value with
standard deviation for normal distribution and compared using
the Student’s Ttest. Variables with a non-normal distribution were
expressed as medians with their interquartile range (IQR) and ana-
lyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables were
demonstrated as proportions and compared using the Chi-square
test. The EDACS-ADP scores were dichotomized into low and high
risk groups based on its standard criteria. Performances of the
EDACS, ECG with troponin, and EDACS-ADP were compared in
terms of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV),and NPV, and the rate of low risk classiﬁcations assigned by each
method. All statistical analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics
V21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A pvalue of < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
A total of 1289 patients who presented at our hospital ED with
chest pain and other possible cardiac symptoms from January 2017to December 2018 were included. Of these, 10 patients who were
unstable at presentation, 4 patients who underwent a CTA for rea-
sons other than an ACS evaluation, and 2 patients who did not have
blood drawn for a troponin assay, were excluded. The remaining
1273 patients were analyzed. The baseline characteristics of these
subjects, including age, sex, and cardiac risk factors included in the
EDACS, are listed by group, with and without the primary outcome,
inTable 1 . The proportion of men, cases with a history of CAD or
diabetes mellitus, and current smoking habits was higher in the
MACE group ( P< 0.05 for all). However, other cardiac risk factors
such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a family history of
CAD were not signiﬁcantly different between the two groups.
Using the EDACS-ADP, 448 (35.2%) patients were classiﬁed as
low risk of which 5 (1.1%) developed MACE within 30 days. There
were 825 patients (64.8%) classiﬁed as high risk and 216 (26.2%) of
these cases developed MACE, yielding a total of 221 occurrences in
the entire study population (17.3%; Fig. 2 ). Among the MACE cases,
25 patients (11.3%) diagnosed with AMI decided to receive medical
treatment rather than undergo a coronary revascularization, 176
(79.6%) underwent PCI, 19 (8.6%) received a CABG, and 1 patient
(0.5%) died due to cardiac arrest caused by ventricular ﬁbrillation.
After dividing the EDACS scores in the groups by intervals of 5
points, the rates of MACE onset were 0% for /C04 to 0 points, 3.84%
for 1–5, 4.32% for 6–10, 14.86% for 11–15, 24.38% for 16–20,
22.48% for 21–25, 20.89% for 26–30, 50% for 31–35, and 50% for
36+ (linear by linear association, P< 0.001; Fig. 3 ). The performance
of the EDACS, ECG with troponin, and EDCAS-ADP scoring systems
were compared by sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, NPV, and the pro-
portion of low risk classiﬁcations assigned ( Table 2 ). A decision tool
using only ECG and serial troponin results demonstrated the high-
est rate of low risk classiﬁcations (73.3%; 95% CI 70.8–75.7), speci-
ﬁcity (82.0%; 95% CI 79.6–84.3), and positive predictive value
(44.4%; 95% CI 40.6–48.3). The EDACS-ADP had the highest sensi-
tivity (97.7%; 95% CI 94.8–99.3) and NPV (98.9%; 95% CI 97.4–
99.5), whereas the smallest proportion of patients were assigned
as low risk (35.2%) with this system among the three methods.
Of the low-risk patients classiﬁed by each scoring system, the
missing rate for composite outcome, which was a 30-day MACE
onset, was 9.47% for the EDACS, followed by 7.50% for ECG with
troponin, and 1.11% for the EDACS-ADP ( Fig. 4 ). Of the 5 missed
MACE patients that had been identiﬁed as low risk by the
EDACS-ADP, 4 were female and their troponin level had not
increased at 2 h other than in 1 patient whose level increased from
0.006 ng/mL to 0.032 ng/mL, which was still within the 99th per-
centile (Supplementary Table 1). The EDACS scores of these 5 cases
ranged from 8 to 12 points and all underwent PCI within 4 days of
ED presentation due to severe stenosis of their coronary arteries,
including the left anterior descending artery.
4. Discussion
The purpose of our current study was to determine whether the
EDACS-ADP could be effectively applied to Korean patients who
presented at our ED with possible cardiac chest pain whilst main-
taining its high performance. We found from our retrospective
analysis that the proportion of patients classiﬁed as having low
short-term risk of MACE using the EDACS-ADP system was 35.2%.
Of these cases, 5 (1.1%) subsequently developed MACE within
30 days of discharge and all underwent PCI within 4 days of their
prior ED presentation. When compared with the EDACS and ECG
with troponin stratiﬁcation systems, the EDACS-ADP showed the
highest sensitivity (97.7%) and highest NPV (98.9%). The ability of
the EDACS-ADP to classify more than 35% of patients as low risk
whilst maintaining a high sensitivity and NPV for MACE indicates
that this method can indeed be applied to a wide variety of ethnic2266 Y.S. Shin et al. / American Journal of Emergency Medicine 38 (2020) 2264–2270
populations. Notably however, the MACE rate of 1.1% among the
patients in our current study series that had been classiﬁed as
low-risk using the EDACS-ADP is still above what is considered
acceptable by many ED physicians for a population of patients with
chest pain who have been discharged without further in-hospital
evaluations.
The accurate determination of low risk for short-term MACE
that will enable a physician to conﬁdently adopt an outpatientfollow-up is an important consideration. Regarding the generaliz-
ability of a rule-out tool, a sensitivity threshold of 98% has been
suggested that the risk of a false-positive test outweighs the risk
of untreated disease [18]. However, when it comes to an acceptable
miss rate for MACE in chest pain, this threshold could be different.
According to the reported results of a prior survey of clinicians in
this regard, half of the respondents selected a miss rate of /C201%
with a majority accepting a /C200.5% value [9]. This ﬁnding suggestsTable 1

that clinicians may require any diagnostic strategies for suspected
ACS to have a sensitivity of /C2199% for MACE. Even though the
EDACS-ADP showed a better performance in our present investiga-
tion than either the EDACS, or ECG with troponin scoring systems,
the MACE miss rate among the classiﬁed low-risk patients is still
above the level that clinicians would likely be comfortable with.
Several previous studies have also estimated the performance of
the EDACS-ADP. In the original study that described this method,
an ability to classify 42.2–51.3% of patients as low risk with a high
sensitivity (99.0%) and NPV (99.6%) was reported. In a subsequent
validation study in Canada, 41.6% of the patients were classiﬁed
into low-risk using the EDACS-ADP [5]. The sensitivity and NPV
were both 100% in that report, suggesting that it could be safely
used to facilitate early discharge in up to 40% of ED chest pain
patients. In a previous randomized controlled trial that compared
the effectiveness of EDACS-ADP versus ADAPT in adult patients
with a suspected AMI, 41.6% of the subjects were identiﬁed aslow risk by EDACS-ADP and no instance of MACE arose within
30 days among this population, showing an NPV of 100% [6]. How-
ever, another study from the United States found that the EDACS-
ADP did not maintain a sufﬁcient sensitivity or NPV level for MACE
[8]. A sensitivity of 88.2% and missed MACE rate of 1.1% was
described in that report, and the authors were therefore unable
to validate the EDACS-ADP as being sufﬁciently sensitive for clini-
cal use. In our present study, the proportion of patients designated
as low risk by the EDACS-ADP was lower than that in the afore-
mentioned reports. (35% vs. 41.6–66.7%) [4–6,8] This ﬁnding may
be due to the different inclusion criteria used in our current inves-
tigation. We included only patients with possible cardiac chest
pain who underwent a coronary CTA. The prior decision to refer
the patients included in our cohort for a CTA was at the discretion
of the treating physician. Hence, patients who had presented at our
ED but were determined to be at very low risk were excluded from
our analysis because they had not undergone any imaging studies.
This would necessarily have reduced the proportion of low risk
cases in our present series. In the same context, the rate of MACE
in our study population was higher than that of the prior studies
discussed earlier (17.3% vs 6–15.5%). In addition, differences
between health care systems and practice trends among the coun-tries in which these earlier studies were conducted would likely
have inﬂuenced the results. Lee et al. [19] reported previously that
there is a trend towards more PCI in Korea compared to other
advanced western countries. This is consistent with our present
observations that approximately 80% of the study patients with
MACE underwent PCI, which is a much higher proportion than
even that of the United States [8,20,21] .
A follow-up troponin assay was done at 2–3 h after ED presen-
tation in our current study subjects but does not seem to have
decreased the performance of the EDACS-ADP in terms of sensitiv-
ity and NPV. This is possibly because cardiac troponin concentra-
tions usually begin to increase at 2–3 h after the onset of
myocardial infarction and last for 7–10 days [22]. A study by Stor-
row et al. supports the idea that a second troponin assay at >2 h
after presentation does not affect the performance of the EDACS-
ADP [23]. Moreover, there have been concerns that the newer gen-
eration troponin assays can affect the performance of the risk

stratiﬁcation process. This issue has been evaluated using a high-
sensitivity troponin assay. According to the report of Cullen et al.
[24], high-sensitivity troponin I has a 99th percentile of
0.026 ng/mL as a cutoff for evidence of myocardial infarction,
which is approximately 35% lower than the cutoff value in a con-
ventional assay. However, even if this assay had been applied to
our study, it would have affected only 1 out of the 5 patients
who were falsely classiﬁed as low risk (a 60-year-old female in
our cohort had an increased 2nd troponin reading of 0.032, which
is less than the 99th percentile in a conventional assay but repre-
sents a positive result in the high-sensitivity troponin assay). The
use of this newer assay would therefore not have signiﬁcantly
affected the performance of the EDACS-ADP. However, further
studies that combine the high-sensitivity troponin method with
EDACS-ADP are warranted to further assess the effects of different
generation troponin assays.
Our present study had several limitations of note. As our anal-
yses were based on the patient database from our single center,
our ﬁndings may not be readily generalizable. However, as we
aimed to validate the EDACS-ADP in a different population from
that used to develop this system, our results may also contribute
to the wider adoption of this protocol to some extent. As our anal-
ysis was retrospective, our data need to be interpreted with some
caution because not every patient would have provided an ade-
quate description of their symptoms for the medical records. It
should thus be noted that speciﬁc information about symptoms,
such as diaphoresis, pleuritic pain, radiating pain, and pain pro-
duced by palpitation that are required for the EDACS-ADP calcula-
tion might not be available from medical records, which could
impact the ﬁndings. The deﬁnition of MACE we used was also dif-
ferent to that described in the original study of the EDACS-ADP. We
narrowed this deﬁnition by excluding ventricular arrhythmias, car-
diogenic shock or a high atrioventricular block. However, consider-
ing our present observations that arrhythmias or heart failure did
not occur in our patients with MACE that the EDACS-ADP missed,
this difference might not have affected our results signiﬁcantly. It
is possible that silent ACS events were unreported in some patients
in our series who were discharged from our ED and not required tohave follow-up biomarker testing or further evaluation. However,
given that all of our study patients underwent a CTA in the ED, this
possibility is very small.
5. Conclusion
Patients presenting with possible cardiac chest pain can be
accurately classiﬁed with a high sensitivity and NPV using the
EDACS-ADP system in accordance with the risk of MACE. However,
the MACE rate among the designated low-risk patients with this
protocol is still above the level considered acceptable by the major-
ity of ED physicians for patients discharged without further evalu-
ation. Future studies will be needed therefore to further validate
the EDACS-ADP and enable it to gain acceptance among clinicians.
