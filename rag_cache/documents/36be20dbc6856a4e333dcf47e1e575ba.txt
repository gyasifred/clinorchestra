Accepted 7 July 2022Objectives: Guidelines recommend the use of risk scoring in patients with chest pain. In this study, we aimed to
compare the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk index (TIMI) score with the Troponin Only ManchesterAcute Coronary Syndrome Score (T-MACS) score and to investigate the usability of the T-MACS score in the
emergency department.
Methods: In our study; The TIMI and T-MACS scores of 310 patients with suspected NSTEMI who applied to the
emergency department with chest pain and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were prospectively
evaluated. The primary outcome was MACE at 30 days including acute coronary syndromes, need for revascular-
ization and deaths. Descriptive data and TIMI and T-MACS scores for predicting MACE and ACS was evaluated bycalculating sensitivity, speci ﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). ROC
(Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis was also performed to determine TIMI and T-MACS risk class.
Results: In our study, the mean age of the patients was 49.7 ± 19.4 years, the 1-month mortality rate was 1.3%,
majör adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate was 6.5%, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rate was 5.5%.T-MACS risk class for predicting MACE sensitivity 100%, selectivity 51.72, PPV 12.5% (for very low risk), NPV
was calculated as 100%; sensitivity for TIMI risk class low risk 35%, selectivity 88.97%, PPV was calculated as
17.9%, NPV was calculated as 95.2%. T-MACS high risk class for predicting MACE; sensitivity was 60%, selectivity99.66%, PPV 92.3% and NPV was 97.3%; TIMI high risk class for predicting MACE; sensitivity was 10%, selectivity
was 97.93%, PPV was 25% and NPV was 94%.
Conclusions: Theﬁndings obtained in this study suggest that the T-MACS score is more successful than the TIMI
score in determining the low risk (very low risk for T-MACS score), high risk, and estimated 1-month MACE riskin cases who presented to the emergency department with chest pain.

1. Introduction
Ischemic heart diseases are among the most signi ﬁcant causes of
death, along with many known risk factors worldwide [ 1]. We are
faced with two separate challenges in patients presenting with ischemic
symptoms, such as quickly making the diagnosis of acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) and detecting those without ACS and thus reducing
the assemblage in the emergency department. Since 1980, deaths due
to ischemic heart disease have gradually declined due to studies onrisk factors in developed countries and treatment for ischemic heart dis-
ease [ 2,3]. Newly developed anticoagulants, early PCI and reperfusion
strategy, ﬁbrinolysis, and 6-month mortality due to the appropriateuse of recommended drugs were strongly associated with reduced
mortality [ 4]. Although short-term mortality in patients diagnosed
with NSTEMI is lower than in patients diagnosed with STEMI, their
long-term mortality is higher due to the burden of coronary artery dis-
ease, comorbidities and increased risk factors [ 5].
The diagnosis of STEMI can be easily made in patients presenting
with chest pain by single or serial ECG assessments [ 6]. In the diagnosis
of NSTEMI, challenges arise, such as the variety of the patient's
symptoms at presentation and the inability to diagnose with ECG [ 7].
Therefore, to improve NSTEMI recognition and management, it is rec-
ommended to use scoring systems, such as thrombolysis in myocardial
infarction risk index (TIMI) and HEART [ 8-10].
The TIMI score was devised by Elliott M. Antman et al. in 2000 to es-
timate the risk of death and developing a cardiac ischemic event, based
on information obtained from the initial medical evaluation of patients
with UA/NSTEMI [ 11]. Troponin Only Manchester Acute CoronaryAmerican Journal of Emergency Medicine 60 (2022) 24 –28

Syndrome Score (T-MACS) is a scoring system designed to exclude
acute coronary syndrome with a single high-sensitivity troponin value
without serial troponin follow-ups in patients presenting in the
emergency department with chest pain [ 12].
In this study, we aimed to prospectively compare the use and
effectiveness of TIMI and T-MACS scores, which are chest pain scores,
in patients admitted to the emergency department with NSTEMI symp-toms, to identify high-risk patients and identify low-risk patients among
them and discharge them safely.
2. Methods2.1. Study design
This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Health Sciences,
Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital (approval number
170–1805). Our study was conducted in Haydarpa şaN u m u n eT r a i n i n g
and Research Hospital emergency room between December 2019 and
July 2020, and consent was obtained from the patients participating in
this study, and the management of the patients was carried out by cer-
tiﬁed ED physicians. Every year, approximately 250,000 patients visit
the ED, where the study was conducted.
To improve NSTEMI recognition and management, it is recom-
mended to use scoring systems. Our primary outcome was MACE at
30 days including acute coronary syndromes, need for revascularization
and deaths. In our study, the ef ﬁcacy of TIMI and T-MACS scores in
predicting NSTEMI was compared by following the patients' outcomes
for MACE, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization and death within
30 days. We aimed to ﬁnd a more effective scoring system to identify
high-risk patients and low-risk patients to safely discharge patients.
Weak points of our study is that it is single-centered. Multicenter pro-
spective studies with more case numbers will help the clinician in the
prediction of ACS and MACE and risk estimation.
2.2. Study setting and population
A study group was formed with patients aged 18 years and older
admitted to our emergency department with symptoms of ischemic
chest pain and were examined with a prediagnosis of NSTEMI and ac-
cepted to participate in the study. Among these patients, those whose
control ECG was compatible with STEMI in the emergency department,
pregnant women and patients with cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest
were not included in this study.
Vital parameters, medical histories, family histories, smoking and
demographic data of the patients were recorded. Physical examination
was administered, a high-sensitive cardiac troponin-T (hs-cTnT) test
was requested and ECGs were taken. The blood samples taken werestudied in the Health Sciences University Haydarpa şa Numune Health
Application and Research Center Biochemistry Laboratory within one
and a half hours. All this information was noted on the previously pre-
pared case form.
To determine adequate sample size G*Power 3.1.9 used [ 13]. Based
on the Ruangsomboon et al. study, the effect size was determined as
d=0 . 6 9 0[ 14]. With the 95% power and 0.05 alpha, the minimum
sample size to be included in the study was calculated as n=1 1 2 .
2.3. Risk score calculation
The TIMI and T-MACS scores of the patients were calculated using
the information recorded on the case form. While calculating the scores,
the standards set in previous studies were adhered to [ 12,15].
TIMI score parameters used in calculations are: Age > 65, > 3 risk
factors for coronary artery disease, two or more anginal attacks in the
last 24 h, known coronary artery stenosis of 50% or more, use of aspirinin the last seven days, newly developed ST change, elevated cardiac
troponins. In the presence of each parameter, the patient gets 1 point.
It is classi ﬁed as 0 –2l o wr i s k ,2 –4 medium risk and 5 –7h i g hr i s k[ 15].
T-MACS score parameters are: ECG ischemia, worsening (or increasing)
angina, pain radiating to the right arm or shoulder, pain associated with
vomiting, sweating detected by a physician, blood pressure which is
lower than 100 mmHg on admission to the emergency department,
Hc-TropoinT value measured at the patient's arrival. In clinical practice,
the T-MACS score calculation is designed to be calculated based on a
computer, tablet or smartphone [ 12
].
After the patients were discharged, Major Adverse Cardiac Event
(MACE) and one-month mortality information were obtained by calling
phone numbers and learning through the death noti ﬁcation system. In
our study, MACE included acute coronary syndromes, deaths and the
need for revascularization.
3. Statistical analysis
While evaluating the data obtained in this study, the analyses were
made using the IBM SPSS 23.0 package program (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY). Descriptive statistics were presented with n (%), mean ± standard
deviation and median (min-max) values. Pearson chi-square test and
Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the relationships between
categorical variables. The Shapiro-Wilks test was used in the analysis
of the assumption of normality. In the analysis of the difference between
the measurement values of the two groups, the Mann-Whitney Utest
was used when it did not comply with the normal distribution, andTable 1

the Student's t-test was used when it did. ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristic) analysis was performed to distinguish patients according
to TIMI and T-MACS risk class and to determine the cut-off point in
determining 1-month mortality, ACS and MACE. Results are presented
by Area Under the Curve (AUC), cut-off points, sensitivity, speci ﬁcity,
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).
p-values <0.05 were considered statistically signi ﬁcant.
4. Results
In our study, 370 cases with suspected NSTEMI and meeting the in-
clusion criteria were examined. STEMI was detected in 23 of these
patients and they were excluded from this study. Sixteen patients left
the study group because they were suspected of pregnancy, and 21 pa-
tients stated that they wanted to withdraw from this study. A study
group was formed with 310 patients. Of the patients participating in
the present study, 54.2% were female and 45.8% were male, with amean age of 49.7 ± 19.4 years (min:18, max:92). The 1-month mortal-
ity rate of the patients was 1.3%, the MACE rate was 6.5%, and the ACS
rate was 5.5%. When the T-MACS risk class distribution of the patients
was examined, it was seen that 150 (48.4%) patients were in the very
low-risk class, 72 (23.2%) in the low-risk class, 75 (24.2%) in the me-
dium and 13 (4.2%) in the high-risk class. When the TIMI risk class
distribution was examined, 271 patients (87.4%) were in the low-risk
class, 31 (10%) were in the medium-risk class, and 8 (2.6%) were in
the high-risk class. The general characteristics of the 310 patients in-
cluded in this study are shown in Table 1 .
A comparison of T-MACS and TIMI according to the study risk class is
given in Table 2 . According to the T-MACS rule-out criteria, 150 patients
were included in the very low-risk class, and MACE and ACS were not
detected among them. According to the TIMI rule-out criteria, 271
patients were classi ﬁed as low risk and 10 ACS were seen among
them. T-MACS correctly identi ﬁed low-risk patients in 100% and TIMI
in 96.3%. While ACS was detected in 92.3% of the patients in the
high-risk class in the T-MACS score, ACS was detected in 25% of the pa-
tients in the TIMI. As seen in Table 3 , when the TIMI and T-MACS test
characteristics were examined among patients who did not meet the
rule-out criteria in predicting MACE, the selectivity detected higher in
the TIMI score (88.97 vs. 51.72, respectively), but the sensitivity was
low in TIMI (35 vs. 100, respectively). As can be seen in Table 4 ,w h e n
the test characteristics were compared between patients who did not
meet the TIMI and T-MACS rule-out criteria in predicting ACS, the
selectivity was higher in TIMI (51.19 vs. 89.08, respectively), but the
sensitivity was lower (41.18 vs. 100, respectively).
While the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as 0.622 (95%
CI: 0.565 –0.676) for the TIMI risk class and 0.926 (95% CI: 0.891 –0.953)
for the T-MACS risk class, the ﬁndings showed that the T-MACS risk
class was statistically more signi ﬁcant in differentiating MACE ( p<0.001). The ROC curve for TIMI and T-MACS risk class to predict MACE
is shown in Fig. 1 .
While the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as 0.653 (95%
CI: 0.598 –0.706) for the TIMI risk class and 0.948 (95% CI: 0.917 –0.970)
for the T-MACS risk class, the ﬁndings showed that the T-MACS risk
class was statistically stronger in differentiating ACS (p < 0.001). The
ROC curve created for TIMI and T-MACS risk class in predicting ACS is
presented in Fig. 2 .
5. Discussion
In this prospective study, we have shown that the T-MACS score is
superior to TIMI in risk assessment and 1-month MACE estimation of
patients who were followed up in the emergency department with a
pre-diagnosis of the acute coronary syndrome but who did not have
STEMI at the time of their admission to the emergency department.
When we look at the literature, in the study conducted by Stephen
et al. in which the modi ﬁ
ed TIMI score and TIMI score were compared,
the incidence of 30-day MACE in patients with TIMI low risk (<3 points)
was 7.3%, while we found this rate to be 4.8% in low-risk patients in our
study [ 16]. In a study by Henry Wamala et al., in which they compared
nine coronary risk scores, ischemic chest pain was present in 11% of pa-
tients with TIMI low risk. In our study, we found chest pain of ischemic
origin in 3.7% of low-risk patients [ 17]. In the study conducted by Body
et al. in which they compared the four scoring systems used to decide on
ACS in the emergency department, the incidence of ACS in high-risk pa-
tients was 80.4% for T-MACS, 51.9% for TIMI, 92.3% for T-MACS and 25%Table 3

for TIMI [ 12]. While the high success of T-MACS in predicting ACS is
consistent with the literature, we think that the low TIMI score is due
to various reasons, such as having more anamnesis, patient incompati-
bility and inability to give adequate anamnesis in emergency room
conditions.
In the study conducted by Richard Body et al., NPV for ACS in very
low-risk patients was 99.3% (95% CI 98.3% to 99.8%), and ACS was
seen in <1% of patients in the very low-risk group. Also, ACS was
excluded in 40.4% of patients [ 12]. In a study conducted by Body et al.,
in which four ACS risk scores were compared, ACS was excluded in
46.5% of patients presenting with chest pain with a sensitivity of 99.2%
(95% CI 95.7% to 100.0%). In our study, a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI
80.5% –100%) was compatible with the literature, with 100% NPV
excluding ACS in 48.3% of the patients [ 12].
While MACE was detected in 76.1% of high-risk cases in the con ﬁr-
mation study of T-MACS and MACS score by Jaimi H Greenslade et al.,
MACE was found in 88.7% in high-risk patients in the study performed
by Van Den Berg et al. [ 18,19]. In the validation study conducted by
Body et al. 91.3% MACE was detected [ 12]. In our study, we found
MACE in 92.3% of the cases in the high-risk class, which is consistent
with the literature.
In the study conducted by Stephen PJ Macdonald et al., while the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) for TIMI 1-month MACE was calculated
as 0.71 (0.67 to 0.74), it was 0.78 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.81) in the study of
Peter DW Reaney et al. [ 16,20]. In our study, the AUC for TIMI in
predicting MACE was calculated as 0.622 (95% CI: 0.565 –0.676). In the
study of Body et al., in which they compared four ACS scores, the area
under the ROC curve in ACS recognition for TIMI was 0.69 (95% CI 0.64
to 0.74), while it was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.98) for T-MACS. In our
study, the area under the ROC curve for ACS was 0.653 (95% CI:
0.598 –0.706) for TIMI and 0.948 (95% CI: 0.917 –0.970) for T-MACS. In
our study, we found T-MACS to be statistically more signi ﬁcant than
TIMI in differentiating MACE and ACS ( p< 0.001). The most important
limitation of our study is that it is single-centered. Multicenter prospec-
tive studies with more case numbers will help the clinician in the
prediction of ACS and MACE and risk estimation.
6. Conclusion
In our study, we found that the T-MACS score was superior to TIMI in
predicting ACS and predicting low risk (very low risk for T-MACS), highrisk and 1-month MACE in patients presenting to the emergency
department with chest pain. Due to the advantages, for example,
T-MACS can be easily calculated in emergency room conditions,
T-MACS is statistically stronger in both ACS detection and MACE predic-
tion than AUC values in ROC analysis ( p< 0.001), T-MACS is more
sensitive than TIMI in detecting risky patients in low-risk patients and
has a higher NPV value, the ﬁndings suggest that the use of T-MACS is
more appropriate than TIMI in risk scoring of NSTEMI cases in
emergency services. In addition, the use of T-MACS is more appropriate
than TIMI in risk scoring of NSTEMI cases since it is important for pa-
tients to provide an accurate anamnesis for a clear evaluation of TIMI,
and this is not always possible in emergency services.
