Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgery in pa -
tients with severe aortic stenosis who are at increased risk for death from surgery; 
less is known about TAVR in low-risk patients.
METHODS
We performed a randomized noninferiority trial in which TAVR with a self-expand -
ing supraannular bioprosthesis was compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients who had severe aortic stenosis and were at low surgical risk. When 850 patients had reached 12-month follow-up, we analyzed data regarding the primary end point, a composite of death or disabling stroke at 24 months, using Bayesian methods.
RESULTS
Of the 1468 patients who underwent randomization, an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure was performed in 1403. The patients’ mean age was 74 years. The 24-month estimated incidence of the primary end point was 5.3% in the TAVR group and 6.7% in the surgery group (difference, −1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible in -
terval for difference, −4.9 to 2.1; posterior probability of noninferiority >0.999). At 30 days, patients who had undergone TAVR, as compared with surgery, had a lower incidence of disabling stroke (0.5% vs. 1.7%), bleeding complications (2.4% vs. 7.5%), acute kidney injury (0.9% vs. 2.8%), and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs. 35.4%) and a higher incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (3.5% vs. 0.5%) and pacemaker implantation (17.4% vs. 6.1%). At 12 months, patients in the TAVR group had lower aortic-valve gradients than those in the surgery group (8.6 mm Hg vs. 11.2 mm Hg) and larger effective orifice areas (2.3 cm
2 vs. 2.0 cm2).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the composite end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months.

n engl j med 380;18 nejm.org May 2, 2019 1707TAVR with a Self-Expanding Valve in Low-Risk Patients
In previous studies, we have shown 
that transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) with the use of a self-expanding su -
praannular bioprosthesis is superior to medical therapy or surgery in patients with severe, symp -
tomatic aortic stenosis who are at prohibitive or high risk for complications or death from sur -
gery
1-3 and is a noninferior approach in patients 
deemed to be at intermediate surgical risk.4,5 
Societal guidelines have endorsed the use of TAVR in patients who are at increased risk for complications or death from surgery,
6,7 and the 
expanded use of TAVR in the United States is closely monitored.
8 The number of TAVR proce -
dures performed in the United States has now surpassed the number of isolated surgical aortic-valve replacements.
9
Use of TAVR in patients at low surgical risk 
requires compelling evidence of safety and ef -
fectiveness, given the low mortality and stroke incidence with aortic-valve surgery in relatively young, healthy patients.
9 Other outcomes, such 
as aortic-valve reintervention, coronary-artery ob -
struction, permanent pacemaker use, and lon -
ger-term valve durability, are metrics that also require scrutiny in this population. One small randomized study of TAVR with a self-expanding bioprosthesis as compared with surgery provides support for the safety of TAVR with a self-expand -
ing bioprosthesis in low-risk patients up to 5 years after the procedure.
10,11
The purpose of the current trial (Evolut Surgi -
cal Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Low Risk Patients) was to evalu -
ate the safety and effectiveness of TAVR with a self-expanding bioprosthesis as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients deemed to have a low risk of death with surgery.
Methods
Trial Design
This study was a multinational, randomized, non -
inferiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of TAVR with those of surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who were deemed to be at low risk for death at 30 days with surgery. The trial was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were enrolled at 86 centers in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United States (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM  
.org). Local institutional review boards or medical ethics committees approved the protocol, available at NEJM.org.
Medtronic funded the trial and developed the 
protocol in collaboration with the executive com -
mittee (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix for members of committees). Medtronic was responsible for site selection, data monitor -
ing, and trial management. Paradigm Biostatistics performed the Bayesian end-point comparisons; an independent statistical consultant validated all end-point analyses. An independent data and safety monitoring board provided study oversight.
The principal investigators (the first and last 
authors) wrote the first draft of the manuscript; all the authors critically reviewed it, made revi -
sions, and supported the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The authors attest that the trial was performed according to the protocol and vouch for the accuracy and com -
pleteness of the data.
Patient Selection
Eligible patients had severe aortic-valve stenosis with suitable anatomy for TAVR or surgery and no more than a predicted 3% risk of death by 30 days with surgery, as assessed by members of the local heart team. Aortic stenosis was defined as an aortic-valve area of 1.0 cm
2 or less (or aortic-
valve area index of ≤0.6 cm2 per square meter) or 
a mean gradient of 40 mm Hg or more or maxi -
mal aortic-valve velocity of 4.0 m or more per second as assessed by transthoracic echocardiog -
raphy performed with the patient at rest. A detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, including criteria for inclusion of asymptomatic patients, is provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix. The screening committee confirmed all decisions regarding patient selection (see the Meth -
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix). All patients provided written informed consent.
Study Procedures
Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio, with variable block sizes, with an electronic ran -
domization system. Randomization was stratified by site and the need for coronary-artery revascu -
larization. Patients assigned to TAVR were treated with one of three self-expanding, supraannular bioprostheses (CoreValve, Evolut R, or Evolut PRO; Medtronic) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix). The size and type of surgical valve were

at the discretion of the surgeon, although candi -
dates for mechanical valves were excluded. Patients 
were evaluated at baseline, at discharge, and at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the procedure. All echocardiographic studies were assessed at an independent core laboratory (Mayo Clinic). Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Kan -
sas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). KCCQ summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status; scores higher than 60 correlate with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II, and a 10-point increase corresponds to moderate clinical improvement.
12,13
Study End Points
The primary safety and effectiveness end point was a composite of death from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 months. Disabling stroke was defined by a score on the modified Rankin scale of 2 or more (with scores ranging from 0 [no symp -
toms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days and an increase of at least 1 category from baseline (i.e., before the stroke). There were seven prespecified secondary end points that were tested hierarchically for either noninferiority or superiority (see the Hier -
archical Testing section in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix). Additional secondary safety end points included a composite of death, disabling stroke, life-threatening bleeding, major vascular com -
plication, or stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury at 30 days; and prosthetic-valve endocarditis, pros -
thetic-valve thrombosis, prosthetic-valve dysfunc -
tion requiring a repeat procedure, stroke, and life-threatening bleeding at 12 months. The full list of secondary end points is provided in the Meth -
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
An independent academic clinical-events com -
mittee (Baim Institute for Clinical Research, Bos -
ton) adjudicated all end points, using standard definitions (Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix). End-point adjudication was blinded when feasible (for some end points, knowledge of treat -
ment assignment was inherent in the end-point assessment).
Statistical Analysis
This trial used Bayesian adaptive statistical meth -
ods with noninformative prior distributions to assess the primary end point. We hypothesized that TAVR would be noninferior to surgery with respect to the primary end point with a noninfe -
riority margin of 6%. The primary end point was to be tested for the superiority of TAVR to sur -
gery if the primary objective (noninferiority with respect to the primary end point) and all seven prespecified hierarchical secondary objectives met their designated success criterion (in the hierar -
chical testing order). The prespecified success criteria were a posterior probability greater than 0.972 for noninferiority and greater than 0.984 for superiority, criteria that were selected empiri -
cally through extensive simulations to achieve a type I error rate of no more than 0.05 for nonin -
feriority testing and no more than 0.025 for su -
periority testing.
The estimated sample size of 1200 patients 
was selected on the basis of an assumed 15% inci -
dence of death or disabling stroke at 24 months; 1468 patients were ultimately enrolled to permit completion of a randomized substudy of valve leaflet immobility and thrombosis and to meet Japanese regulatory requirements. A prespecified Bayesian interim analysis was to be performed 12 months after the 850th patient underwent the study procedure (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who did not complete 24 months of follow-up, we im -
puted their outcome according to a prespecified statistical model, which was based on the patient’s last known clinical status. A sensitivity analysis was performed to account for missing data, in -
cluding data for the patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study.
The primary analysis cohort was the as-treated 
population, which comprised patients who were randomly assigned to a group and who under -
went an attempted procedure. Secondary analyses of the primary end point were also performed in the intention-to-treat population, the “implant -
ed” population (patients in whom an aortic valve was implanted), and the per-protocol population. Details regarding the primary objective, analysis populations, sensitivity analyses, and hierarchi -
cal testing methods among secondary end points are provided in the Methods section in the Sup -
plementary Appendix. We used a Bayesian ana -
logue of a two-sample t-test to compare continuous variables with a noninformative prior distribution. Event rates are summarized as Bayesian posterior medians with 95% credible intervals, which were calculated from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles

of the posterior distributions. The Bayesian cred -
ible intervals for secondary end points use mar -
ginal posterior distributions that are probably 
narrower than those that are based on a true multidimensional posterior for the collection of outcomes. Caution should therefore be exercised in drawing inferences about absolute treatment effects with the 95% Bayesian credible intervals, owing to the multiplicity of secondary end-point comparisons.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
From March 28, 2016, to November 27, 2018, a total of 1468 patients underwent randomization; 734 were assigned to TAVR and 734 were assigned to surgery. After randomization, the assigned pro -
cedure was not attempted in 12 patients assigned to TAVR and 53 patients assigned to surgery; in 3 patients assigned to surgery, TAVR was at -
tempted instead (Fig. S2 and Results section in the Supplementary Appendix). The as-treated co -
hort included 1403 patients: 725 in the TAVR group and 678 in the surgery group.
Demographic and baseline characteristics and 
cardiac risk factors are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 74 years, 34.9% were women, and all the patients were at low surgical risk. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Among patients who were assigned to the surgery group, the baseline characteristics of those who actually underwent surgery were similar to the characteristics of those who did not undergo surgery (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). A detailed descrip -
tion of procedural end points is provided in the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix.
At this prespecified interim analysis, 12-month 
follow-up was available for 432 patients in the TAVR group and 352 in the surgery group; 24-month follow-up was available for 72 patients in the TAVR group and 65 patients in the sur -
gery group. The median follow-up time in each group was 12.2 months.
Primary Safety and Effectiveness End Point
The incidence of death or disabling stroke at 24 months (the primary end point) was 5.3% in the TAVR group (95% Bayesian credible interval, 3.3 to 8.0) and 6.7% in the surgery group (95% Bayes -ian credible interval, 4.4 to 9.6). The prespecified criterion for noninferiority was met (difference, −1.4 percentage points; 95% Bayesian credible interval for the difference, −4.9 to 2.1; posterior probability of noninferiority, >0.999) ( Fig. 1); the 
prespecified criterion for superiority was not met (posterior probability of superiority, 0.779). A non -
inferiority analysis using the intention-to-treat cohort yielded similar results. A sensitivity anal -
ysis that was performed to account for patients who were lost to follow-up also had similar re -
sults (details on these analyses are provided in Tables S6 through S8 and the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
The 24-month estimated incidence of death 
from any cause was 4.5% in the TAVR group and 4.5% in the surgery group (difference, 0 percent -
age points; 95% credible interval for the differ -
ence, −3.2 to 3.2). The 24-month estimated inci -
dence of disabling stroke was 1.1% in the TAVR group and 3.5% in the surgery group (difference, −2.3 percentage points; 95% credible interval for the difference, −4.8 to −0.4). No significant treat -
ment-by-subgroup interactions were noted for the primary end point (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary Safety Measures
The incidence of the secondary composite safety end point at 30 days was 5.3% in the TAVR group and 10.7% in the surgery group (Table  2). 
The incidence of death from any cause at 30 days was 0.5% in the TAVR group and 1.3% in the surgery group; causes of death are shown in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. The ratio of observed to expected incidence of death from any cause by 30 days (with expected risk calculated on the basis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality [STS-PROM] model) was 0.26 in the TAVR group and 0.68 in the surgery group. New atrial fibrillation at 30 days occurred in 7.7% of the patients in the TAVR group and in 35.4% in the surgery group (differ -
ence, −27.7 percentage points; credible interval for the difference, −31.8 to −23.6), whereas per -
manent pacemaker implantation occurred in 17.4% of the patients in the TAVR group and in 6.1% in the surgery group (difference, 11.3 percentage points; credible interval for the difference, 8.0 to 14.7) (Table 2). Incidences of stroke, prosthetic-valve thrombosis, endocarditis, and reinterven -

all these end points met the prespecified test threshold. Symptoms graded by NYHA class de -creased significantly from baseline in both groups, and this reduction in symptoms persisted through -
out the 12-month follow-up period (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Hospitalization for heart failure during the 12-month follow-up pe -

KCCQ overall summary score (±SD) measuring quality of life was 88.7±14.2 in the TAVR group and 78.6±18.9 in the surgery group at 30 days, with no difference between groups observed at 12 months (Table S10 in the Supplementary Ap -
pendix). Among patients who were discharged from the hospital after undergoing TAVR, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death by 12 months between those who received a new permanent pacemaker and those who did not (3.4% and 1.2%, respectively).
Echocardiographic Findings
Aortic-valve hemodynamics improved from base -
line in both groups (Fig.  2). Mean aortic-valve 
gradients were lower at 12 months in the TAVR group than in the surgery group; the mean ef -
fective orifice area was larger in the TAVR group than in the surgery group (Table 3). Moderate or 
severe total aortic regurgitation was present at 30 days in 3.5% of the patients in the TAVR group and in 0.5% in the surgery group. Severe patient–prosthesis mismatch occurred at 12 months in 1.8% of the patients in the TAVR group and in 8.2% in the surgery group (Table S11 in the Sup -
plementary Appendix).Discussion
Our study, which used an adaptive Bayesian de -
sign, showed that among patients deemed to be at a low risk for death from surgery, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgery with respect to the risk of death or disabling stroke at 24 months. TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was associated with a lower incidence of dis -
abling stroke, acute kidney injury, bleeding events, and atrial fibrillation than surgery but with a higher incidence of aortic regurgitation and per -
manent pacemaker use. Both TAVR and surgery provided functional improvement at 12 months, but the TAVR group had better recovery at 30 days, as indicated by the KCCQ score.
Our study group has conducted a series of 
clinical studies that have compared TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis with surgery in patients at various degrees of surgical risk.
2,5,14 The current interim analysis includes 
patients at the lowest reported risk from surgery among these trials (mean STS-PROM, 1.9%). The 30-day incidence of death in both groups was very low (0.5% in the TAVR group and 1.3% in the surgery group) with a low ratio of observed-Figure 1.

(0.26 in the TAVR group and 0.68 in the surgery group), a finding that is probably attributable to the use of best practices by our heart teams. We selected the primary end point of death from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 months owing to the implications of these results for patients and providers considering options for aortic-valve re -
placement. The estimated 24-month incidence of death from any cause was low (4.5%) in both groups, a finding that reinforced the fact that our study included healthier patients with severe aortic-valve disease.

ing transcatheter and surgical procedures.
15,16 We performed functional neurologic assessments before and after both procedures; a very small number of patients (<2%) in the TAVR group received an embolic protection device (see the Supplementary Appendix). Although the incidence of stroke was similar in the two groups, disabling stroke by 30 days occurred less often in the TAVR group, and the incidence remained lower at 24 months; these findings are similar to those in previous randomized trials of TAVR involving patients at increased surgical risk.

Although aortic-valve hemodynamics were sub -
stantially improved from baseline in both groups, we found lower aortic-valve gradients and larger aortic-valve areas in the TAVR group, findings that are probably related to the supraannular design of the self-expanding bioprostheses.

*  Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The numbers of patients with data are in parentheses. All noninferiority objectives were tested with a type I error standard of 0.05, and superiority 
tests were tested with a type I error of 0.025. If all the tests met their success criterion, the primary end point of death or disabling stroke at 24 months was tested for superiority with type I error rate of 0.025.
†  Clinically meaningful differences of 5 mm Hg for mean gradient, 0.1 cm
2 for effective orifice area, and 0.375 for the NYHA class were determined by the Low Risk Trial Executive 
Committee.
‡  Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status; scores higher than 60 correlate with NYHA class I or II, and a 10-point increase corresponds to moderate clinical improvement. An increase of 5 points was deemed to be clinically meaningful.

22.1% of the patients in the surgery group received 
small (19-mm or 21-mm) prostheses, the mean aortic-valve areas were large (2.0 cm
2), and the in -
cidence of 12-month severe prosthesis–patient mismatch (8.2%) was less than in previous re -
ports.
20,21 Nonetheless, valve areas were larger, 
and the frequency of prosthesis–patient mismatch was lower, with TAVR. In contrast, rates of aortic regurgitation were higher in the TAVR group. Longer-term follow-up will be necessary to un -
derstand the implications of these various valve characteristics on structural valve deterioration and long-term outcomes. We found a low inci -
dence (<1%) of bioprosthetic-valve thrombosis, endocarditis, or need for aortic-valve reinterven -
tion with both self-expanding and surgical bio -
prostheses.
Our study has several limitations. The most 
important limitation is that this prespecified interim analysis occurred when 850 patients had reached 12 months of follow-up, and complete 24-month follow-up of the entire cohort has not been reached. Definitive conclusions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of TAVR as compared with surgery await long-term clinical and echocardiographic follow-up, which is planned to continue through 10 years for all patients. Second, although the amount of missing data in the trial was small, some patients did not have complete follow-up data on NYHA functional class, KCCQ scores, and echocardiography. Third, end-point adjudication could not be performed in a blinded manner for all end points, which may have resulted in bias in end-point assessment. Fourth, we excluded patients with bicuspid aortic valves and those who were candidates for me -
chanical valves. Finally, the latest-generation Evo -
lut PRO bioprosthesis was used in only 22.3% of the patients who received TAVR.
In conclusion, in a randomized trial involving 
patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low risk for death from surgery, TAVR with a self-expanding supraannular bioprosthesis was noninferior to surgical aortic-valve replacement with respect to death from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 months.
