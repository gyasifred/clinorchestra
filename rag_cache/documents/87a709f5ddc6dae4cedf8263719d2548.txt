Background :Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one
of the most common mental disorders; however, thereis no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The ob-jective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scaleto identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reli-ability and validity.
Methods :A criterion-standard study was performed in
15 primary care clinics in the United States from No-vember 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adultpatients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patientshad a telephone interview with a mental health profes-sional within 1 week. For criterion and construct valid-ity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared withindependent diagnoses made by mental health profes-sionals; functional status measures; disability days; andhealth care use.
Results :A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good re-liability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and pro-
cedural validity. A cut point was identified that opti-mized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasingscores on the scale were strongly associated with mul-tiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Out-comes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scalesand disability days). Although GAD and depression symp-toms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmedthem as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and de-pression symptoms had differing but independent ef-fects on functional impairment and disability. There wasgood agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.
Conclusion :The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for
screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinicalpractice and research.

ONE OF THE MOST COM -
mon anxiety disordersseen in general medicalpractice and in the gen-eral population is gener-
alized anxiety disorder (GAD). The disor-der has an estimated current prevalence ingeneral medical practice of 2.8% to 8.5%
1-3
and in the general population of 1.6% to5.0%.
4-6Whereas depression in clinical set-
tings has generated substantial research,there have been far fewer studies of anxi-ety. In part, this may be because of the pau-city of brief validated measures for anxietycompared with the numerous measures fordepression,
7,8such as the Primary Care
Evaluation of Mental Disorders 9-item Pa-tient Health Questionnaire (PHQ).
9-11This
situation is unfortunate, given the highprevalence of anxiety disorders, as well astheir associated disability and the availabil-ity of effective treatments, both pharmaco-logical and nonpharmacological.
12,13
Measures of anxiety are seldom used in
clinical practice because of their length,proprietary nature, lack of usefulness as
a diagnostic and severity measure,14-17and
requirement of clinician administrationrather than patient self-report.
18,19The goal
of this study was to develop a brief scaleto identify probable cases of GAD and toassess symptom severity. We conducteda study in multiple primary care sites toselect the items for the final scale and toevaluate its reliability and validity.
METHODS
GAD SCALE DEVELOPMENT
We first selected potential items for a brief GAD
scale. The initial item pool consisted of 9 itemsthat reflected all of the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) symptom criteria for GAD and 4
items on the basis of review of existing anxi-ety scales. A 13-item questionnaire was devel-oped that asked patients how often, during thelast 2 weeks, they were bothered by each symp-tom. Response options were “not at all,” “sev-Author Affiliations: Biometrics

eral days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly every day,”
scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In addition, an item toassess duration of anxiety symptoms was included. Our goalwas to determine the number of items necessary to achieve goodreliability and procedural, construct, and diagnostic criterionvalidity.
PATIENT SAMPLE
Patients were enrolled from November 2004 through June 2005from a research network of 15 primary care sites located in 12states (13 family practice, 2 internal medicine) administeredcentrally by Clinvest, Inc (Springfield, Mo). The purpose of theproject’s first phase (n=2149) was to select the scale items andcutoff scores to be used for making a GAD diagnosis. The pur-pose of the second phase (n=591) was to determine the scale’stest-retest reliability. In all, 2982 subjects were approached and2739 (91.9%) completed the study questionnaire with no orminimal missing data. To minimize sampling bias, we ap-proached consecutive patients at each site in clinic sessions un-til the target quota for that week was achieved.
In the first phase, 1654 subjects also agreed to a telephone
interview, and of these, a random sample of 965 were inter-viewed within 1 week of their clinic visit by 1 of 2 mentalhealth professionals (MHPs)—a PhD clinical psychologist anda senior psychiatric social worker. In the study’s secondphase, 591 subjects who had completed the research ques-tionnaire were sent a 1-page questionnaire that consisted ofthe 13 potential GAD scale items. Of these, 236 subjectsreturned the completed 1-page questionnaire with no or mini-mal missing data within a week of completing the researchquestionnaire at the clinic. The mean GAD scale score of sub-jects returning the questionnaire did not differ from that ofsubjects who did not return the questionnaire. The study wasapproved by the Sterling Institutional Review Board, Spring-field, Mo.
SELF-REPORT RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE
Before seeing their physicians, patients completed a 4-page ques-tionnaire that included the 13 items being tested for use in theGAD scale, as well as questions about age, sex, education, eth-nicity, and marital status; the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20),
20,21which measures func-
tional status in 6 dimensions; and either the 12-item anxietysubscale from the Symptom Checklist-90
16(first study phase
only) or the Beck Anxiety Inventory14(second study phase only).
Depression was assessed with the PHQ-8, which includes allitems from the PHQ-9 except for the item about suicidal ide-ation; PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 scores are highly correlated and havenearly identical operating characteristics.
22Finally, patients com-
pleted items regarding physician visits and disability days dur-ing the previous 3 months.
MHP INTERVIEW
The 2 MHPs conducted structured psychiatric interviews bytelephone, blinded to the results of the self-report research ques-tionnaire. The interview consisted of the GAD section of theStructured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ,
23modified with sev-
eral additional questions to assess in greater detail some of theGAD diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV . The resulting DSM-IV GAD
diagnosis, with the DSM-IV 6-month duration criterion, was
used as the criterion standard for assessing the validity of thenew scale. The interview also included the 13 potential GADscale items to test agreement between self-report and clinicianadministration (ie, procedural validity).
24DATA ANALYSIS
The best items for the GAD scale were selected by rank order-ing the correlation of each item with the total 13-item scale scorein the sample of 1184 patients who did not undergo the MHPinterview. Item-total score correlations were reexamined in 2independent subsamples of the study population: the 965 pa-tients who underwent the MHP interview and the 591 pa-tients in the second phase of the study. In addition, we con-ducted receiver operating characteristic analyses with varyingnumbers of items in these 965 patients by using an MHP di-agnosis of GAD as the criterion standard. Divergent validity ofeach item was assessed by calculating the difference betweenthe item correlations with the 13-item anxiety score and thePHQ-8 depression score. Convergent validity was assessed byexamining correlations of the final version of the GAD scalewith the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale ofthe Symptom Checklist-90, even though neither scale is spe-cific for GAD.
To assess construct validity, we used analysis of covari-
ance to examine associations between anxiety severity on thefinal GAD scale and SF-20 functional status scales, self-reported disability days, and physician visits, controlling fordemographic variables. For criterion validity, we investi-gated sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likeli-hood ratios for a range of cutoff scores of the final scale withrespect to the MHP diagnosis. To investigate whether anxi-ety as measured by the GAD-7 and depression as measuredby the PHQ-8 reflect distinct dimensions, we assessed facto-rial validity by using confirmatory factor analyses. Finally,procedural validity and test-retest reliability were assessedby means of intraclass correlation.

RESULTS
DESCRIPTION OF PATIENTS
The mean (SD) age of the patients was 47.4 (15.5) years
(range, 18-95 years). Most (65%) were female; 80% werewhite non-Hispanic, 8% were African American, and 9%were Hispanic; 64% were married, 13% were divorced,and 15% were never married; and 31% had a high schooldegree or equivalent, whereas 62% had attended somecollege.
ITEM SELECTION FOR THE GAD SCALES
The GAD-7 (
Figure 1 ) consists of the 7 items with
the highest correlation with the total 13-item scalescore ( r=0.75-0.85). Receiver operating characteristic
analysis with this set of items showed an area underthe curve (0.906) as good as scales with as much asthe full 13-item set. These 7 items also had the highestrank correlations in the developmental sample(n=1184) and the 2 replication samples (n=965 andn=591). The 2 core criteria (A and B) of the DSM-IV
definition of GAD are captured by the first 3 items ofthe scale.
26Of note, 6 of the 7 items had the greatest
divergent validity (ie, the highest difference betweenthe item-total scale score correlation and item-PHQ-8depression score correlation [ /H9004r=0.16-0.21]). Because
each of the 7 items is scored from 0 to 3, the GAD-7scale score ranges from 0 to 21.

RELIABILITY AND PROCEDURAL VALIDITY
The internal consistency of the GAD-7 was excellent
(Cronbach /H9251=.92). Test-retest reliability was also good
(intraclass correlation=0.83). Comparison of scores de-rived from the self-report scales with those derived fromthe MHP-administered versions of the same scales yieldedsimilar results (intraclass correlation=0.83), indicatinggood procedural validity.
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERION VALIDITY AND SCALE
OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS
Table 1 summarizes the operating characteristics of the
GAD-7 at various cut points. As expected, as the cut pointincreases, sensitivity decreases and specificity increases ina continuous fashion. At a cut point of 10 or greater, sen-sitivity and specificity exceed 0.80, and sensitivity is nearlymaximized. Results were similar for men and women andfor those aged less and those aged more than the mean ageof 47 years. The proportion of primary care patients whoscore at this level is high (23%). A cut point of 15 or greatermaximizes specificity and approximates a prevalence (9%)more in line with current epidemiologic estimates of GADprevalence in primary care. However, sensitivity at this highcut point is low (48%). Most patients (89%) with GAD hadGAD-7 scores of 10 or greater, whereas most patients (82%)without GAD had scores less than 10.
The mean (SD) GAD-7 score was 14.4 (4.7) in the 73
patients with GAD diagnosed according to the MHP and4.9 (4.8) in the 892 patients without GAD. The preva-lence of GAD according to the MHP interview was 9%in women and 4% in men. In the entire sample of 2739patients, the mean GAD-7 score was 6.1 in women and4.6 in men.
Although the GAD-7 scale inquires about symptoms
in the past 2 weeks, the criterion-standard MHP inter-view required at least a 6-month duration of symptomsconsistent with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for GAD. None-
theless, the operating characteristics of the scale were goodbecause most patients with high symptom scores hadchronic symptoms. Of the 433 patients with GAD-7 scores
of 10 or greater, 96% had symptoms for 1 month or more,and 67% had symptoms for 6 months or more.
CONSTRUCT VALIDITY
There was a strong association between increasing GAD-7
severity scores and worsening function on all 6 SF-20scales (
Table 2 ). As GAD-7 scores went from mild to
moderate to severe, there was a substantial stepwise de-cline in functioning in all 6 SF-20 domains. Most pair-wise comparisons within each SF-20 scale between suc-cessive GAD-7 severity levels were significant. Therelationship between GAD severity and functional im-pairment was similar in men and women.
Figure 2 illustrates graphically the relationship be-
tween increasing GAD-7 scale scores and worsening func-tional status. Decrements in SF-20 scores are shown in termsof effect size (ie, the difference in mean SF-20 scores, ex-pressed as the number of SDs, between each GAD-7 inter-val subgroup and the reference group). The reference groupis the group with the lowest GAD-7 scores (ie, 0-4), andthe SD used is that of the entire sample. Effect sizes of 0.5and 0.8 are typically considered moderate and large be-tween-group differences, respectively.
27
When the GAD-7 was examined as a continuous vari-
able, its strength of association with the SF-20 scales wasconcordant with the pattern seen in Figure 2. The GAD-7correlated most strongly with mental health (0.75), fol-lowed by social functioning (0.46), general health per-ceptions (0.44), bodily pain (0.36), role functioning(0.33), and physical functioning (0.30).
Table 3 shows the association between GAD-7 se-
verity levels and 3 other measures of construct validity:self-reported disability days, clinic visits, and the gen-eral amount of difficulty patients attribute to their symp-toms. Greater levels of anxiety severity were associatedwith a monotonic increase in disability days, health careuse, and symptom-related difficulty in activities and re-lationships. When the GAD-7 was examined as a con-tinuous variable, its correlation was 0.27 with disabilitydays, 0.22 with physician visits, and 0.63 with symptom-related difficulty.
Convergent validity of the GAD-7 was good, as dem-
onstrated by its correlations with 2 anxiety scales: the BeckAnxiety Inventory ( r=0.72) and the anxiety subscale of
the Symptom Checklist-90 ( r=0.74). Consistent with re-
sults of previous studies of anxiety and depression,
4,28the
GAD-7 and Symptom Checklist-90 anxiety scales alsostrongly correlated with our depression measure, thePHQ-8 ( r=0.75 and r=0.74, respectively). Nonetheless,
measuring anxiety and depression was complementaryrather than duplicative. We determined the prevalenceof high anxiety and high depression symptom severityin our sample, defined as severe scores ( /H1135015) on the
GAD-7 and PHQ-8 depression scales, respectively. In the2114 patients who completed the GAD-7 and the PHQ-8,there were 1877 (88.8%) patients with neither high anxi-ety nor high depression, 99 (4.68%) with high anxietyonly, 68 (3.2%) with high depression only, and 70 (3.31%)with high anxiety and high depression.

anxiety and high depression scores, there was an addi-tive effect on the SF-20 mental health and social func-tioning scales, as well as self-reported disability days andhealth care use.
FACTORIAL VALIDITY
Principal component analysis of a set of 15 items that in-
cludes the 8 depression items of the PHQ-8 and the 7 anxi-ety items of the GAD-7 indicated that the first 2 emer-gent factors had an eigenvalue greater than 1. Sixty-three percent of the total variance was explained by thefirst 2 factors. The varimax-rotated component-matrixclearly confirmed the original allocation of the items tothe PHQ scales, with all depression items having the high-est factor loadings on 1 factor (0.58-0.75) and all anxi-ety items having the highest factor loadings on the sec-ond factor (0.69-0.81).
COMMENT
This study has several major findings. First, a 7-item anxi-ety scale—the GAD-7—is a useful tool with strong cri-terion validity for identifying probable cases of GAD. Sec-
ond, the scale is also an excellent severity measure asdemonstrated by the fact that increasing scores on theGAD-7 are strongly associated with multiple domains offunctional impairment and disability days. Third, al-
though many patients had anxiety and depressive symp-toms, factor analysis confirms GAD and depression as dis-tinct dimensions.
This study reports the development and validation of
a measure for evaluating the presence and severity of GADin clinical practice, the GAD-7, one of the few GAD mea-sures that is also specifically linked to the DSM-IV (Text
Revision) criteria.
19,26A score of 10 or greater on the GAD-7
represents a reasonable cut point for identifying cases ofGAD. Cut points of 5, 10, and 15 might be interpretedas representing mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxi-ety on the GAD-7, similar to levels of depression on thePHQ-9.
10The GAD-7 may be particularly useful in as-
sessing symptom severity and monitoring change acrosstime, although its responsiveness to change remains tobe tested in treatment studies.
Construct validity was demonstrated by the fact that
increasing scores on the GAD-7 scale were strongly as-sociated with multiple domains of functional impair-Table 1. Operating Characteristics of GAD-7 at Different Cutoffs *

ment. Furthermore, there was a strong association with
self-reported disability days and a modest association withincreased health care use.
To facilitate assessment of change in severity of anxi-
ety symptoms, the GAD-7 asks about recent symptoms(ie, in the past 2 weeks). However, most patients withhigh scores had chronic symptoms, which is why the op-erating characteristics proved good with use of our cri-terion-standard MHP interviews based on the conven-tional GAD duration criterion of 6 months. However, theNational Comorbidity Survey showed that patients withepisodes of 1 to 5 months do not differ greatly from thosewith episodes of 6 months or more in onset, persis-tence, impairment, comorbidity, parental GAD, or so-ciodemographic correlates.
5Kessler et al5conclude that
there is little basis for excluding these people from a di-agnosis. Notably, 96% of patients with GAD-7scores of10 or greater in our primary care sample had symptomsof a month or more, whereas 67% had symptoms of 6months or longer. It may be that in treatment trials inwhich response to therapy is evaluated, assessing GADsymptom change during a shorter time (eg, the past week)may be desirable.
The high comorbidity of anxiety and depressive dis-
orders and the high correlation between depressiveand anxiety measures is well known.
17,29Not surpris-
ingly, our depression measure, the PHQ-8, stronglycorrelated with the GAD-7 and the SymptomChecklist-90 anxiety scales. Nonetheless, factor analy-sis confirmed the value of assessing anxiety anddepression as 2 separate dimensions. In addition, anumber of patients with high anxiety symptomsaccording to the GAD-7 did not have high depressionsymptom severity, and patients with increasing sever-ity of anxiety symptoms had corresponding greaterimpairment in multiple domains of functional status.Together, these findings indicate that using only adepression measure to identify depressed patients whomay benefit from treatment will miss a clinicallyimportant part of the patient population with dis-abling anxiety who also would benefit from treatment.Several limitations of our study should be noted. First,
the GAD-7 scale focuses on only 1 anxiety disorder, al-though there are many patients with other anxiety dis-orders, such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress dis-order, who need clinical attention. However, GAD is oneof the most common mental disorders seen in outpa-tient practice. Second, the GAD-7 provides only prob-able diagnoses that should be confirmed by further evalu-ation. Third, because our study was cross-sectional,prospective observational and treatment studies areneeded to determine the responsiveness of the GAD-7in assessing change across time. Because there is alreadyevidence for the responsiveness of the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2depression scales,
30,31future research also likely will dem-
onstrate that the GAD-7 scale is useful in assessing changesin the severity of anxiety over time.
This study has a number of strengths, including its
large sample size, diverse clinical settings, and its gen-eralizability to primary care, where most patients withanxiety and depression are treated.
2Also, the GAD-7 is
efficient in that it is brief and can be completed entirelyby the patient. This latter feature is particularly impor-tant, given the time constraints and competing de-mands for busy clinicians.
32Although the GAD-7 was de-
veloped and validated in primary care, we expect that,like the PHQ-9 depression measure, the GAD-7 will haveconsiderable utility in busy mental health settings andclinical research, which is especially important given thehigh prevalence and substantial disability associated withGAD.0
