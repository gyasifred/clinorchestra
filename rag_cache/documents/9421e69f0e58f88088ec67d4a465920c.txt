The term cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) increasingly has been used without a consistent or well-accepted deﬁni-
tion. To include the vast array of interrelated derangements, and to stress the bidirectional nature of heart-kidney interactions, we present a new classiﬁcation of the CRS with 5 subtypes that reﬂect the pathophysiology,the time-frame, and the nature of concomitant cardiac and renal dysfunction. CRS can be generally deﬁned as apathophysiologic disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of 1 organ may induceacute or chronic dysfunction of the other. Type 1 CRS reﬂects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function (e.g.,acute cardiogenic shock or decompensated congestive heart failure) leading to acute kidney injury. Type 2 CRScomprises chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g., chronic congestive heart failure) causing progressivechronic kidney disease. Type 3 CRS consists of an abrupt worsening of renal function (e.g., acute kidney isch-emia or glomerulonephritis) causing acute cardiac dysfunction (e.g., heart failure, arrhythmia, ischemia). Type 4CRS describes a state of chronic kidney disease (e.g., chronic glomerular disease) contributing to decreased car-diac function, cardiac hypertrophy, and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Type 5 CRS reﬂects asystemic condition (e.g., sepsis) causing both cardiac and renal dysfunction. Biomarkers can contribute to anearly diagnosis of CRS and to a timely therapeutic intervention. The use of this classiﬁcation can help physicianscharacterize groups of patients, provides the rationale for speciﬁc management strategies, and allows the de-sign of future clinical trials with more accurate selection and stratiﬁcation of the population underinvestigation.

A large proportion of patients admitted to hospital have
various degrees of heart and kidney dysfunction (1). Primarydisorders of 1 of these 2 organs often result in secondarydysfunction or injury to the other (2). Such interactionsrepresent the pathophysiological basis for a clinical entitycalled cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) (3). Although generallydeﬁned as a condition characterized by the initiation and/orprogression of renal insufﬁciency secondary to heart failure(4), the term CRS is also used to describe the negativeeffects of reduced renal function on the heart and circulation(5). The absence of a clear deﬁnition and the complexity ofthis cluster of conditions contribute to lack of clarity withregard to diagnosis and management (6). This is unfortu-nate, because recent advances in basic and clinical scienceshave improved our understanding of organ crosstalk andhave demonstrated the efﬁcacy of some therapies in atten-uating both cardiac and renal injury (7). Thus, a more
articulated deﬁnition in terms of clinical presentation, patho-physiology, diagnosis, and management is needed to explorethe complex nature of CRS and its different clinical subtypes.CRS: A Deﬁnition
The simplistic view of CRS is that a relatively normal
kidney is dysfunctional because of a diseased heart, with the
assumption that, in the presence of a healthy heart, the samekidney would perform normally (8). This concept has been
recently challenged, and a more articulated deﬁnition of theCRS has been advocated (5). The CRS includes a variety ofacute or chronic conditions, where the primary failing organcan be either the heart or the kidney (9).
Previous terminology did not allow physicians to identify
and fully characterize the chronology of the pathophysio-logical interactions that characterize a speciﬁc type ofcombined heart/kidney disorder. A diseased heart has nu-merous negative effects on kidney function but, at the sametime, renal insufﬁciency can signiﬁcantly impair cardiacfunction (9). Thus, direct and indirect effects of each organ
that is dysfunctional can initiate and perpetuate the com-bined disorder of the 2 organs through a complex combi-nation of neurohormonal feedback mechanisms. For thisreason, a subdivision of CRS into 5 different subtypes seemsto provide a more concise and logically correct approach.CRS type 1 (acute CRS). Type 1 CRS is characterized by
a rapid worsening of cardiac function, leading to acutekidney injury (AKI) (Fig. 1). Acute heart failure (HF) maybe divided into 4 subtypes: hypertensive pulmonary edemawith preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function,

acutely decompensated chronic
HF, cardiogenic shock, and pre-dominant right ventricular fail-ure (10). Type 1 CRS is a com-
mon occurrence. More than 1million patients in the U.S. areadmitted to the hospital everyyear with either de novo acuteHF or acutely decompensatedchronic HF (11). Among thesepatients, pre-morbid chronic re-nal dysfunction is a common oc-currence and predisposes them toAKI (12,13). The mechanismsby which the onset of acute HFor acutely decompensated chronicHF leads to AKI are multipleand complex (4)( Fig. 1). The
clinical importance of eachmechanism is likely to vary frompatient to patient (e.g., acute car-diogenic shock vs. hypertensivepulmonary edema) and situationto situation (acute HF secondaryto perforation of a mitral valveleaﬂet from endocarditis vs.
worsening right HF secondary to noncompliance withdiuretic therapy). In acute HF, AKI appears to be moresevere in patients with impaired LV ejection fraction com-pared with those with preserved LV function, achieving anincidence /H1102270% in patients with cardiogenic shock (14).
Furthermore, impaired renal function is consistently foundas an independent risk factor for 1-year mortality in acuteHF patients, including patients with ST-segment elevationmyocardial infarction (15). A plausible reason for thisindependent effect might be that an acute decline in renalfunction does not simply act as a marker of illness sever-ity but also carries an associated acceleration in cardiovas-cular pathobiology through activation of inﬂammatorypathways (9,16).
In CRS type 1, a salient clinical issue is how the onset of
AKI impacts on prognosis and treatment of acute HF. Theﬁrst clinical principle is that the onset of AKI in this settingimplies inadequate renal perfusion until proven otherwise,which should prompt clinicians to consider the diagnosis ofa low cardiac output state and/or marked increase in venouspressure leading to kidney congestion through the use ofphysical examination, ancillary signs, imaging, and labora-tory ﬁndings.
The second important consequence of type 1 CRS is
decreased diuretic responsiveness. In a congestive state,decreased response to diuretics may result from the physi-ological phenomena of diuretic braking (diminished diureticeffectiveness secondary to postdiuretic sodium retention)(17) and post-diuretic sodium retention (18). In addition,concerns of aggravating AKI by the administration ofdiuretics at greater doses or in combination also can act as anadditional, iatrogenic mechanism. Diuretics are best pro-vided to HF patients with evidence of systemic ﬂuidoverload with the goal of achieving a gradual diuresis. Loopdiuretics may be titrated according to renal function, systolicblood pressure, and history of chronic diuretic use. Highdoses may cause tinnitus, and a continuous low-dose di-uretic infusion might be more efﬁcient (19).
Measurement of cardiac output (arterial pressure monitoring
combined with pulse contour analysis or by Doppler ultra-sound) and venous pressure may help ensure adequate andtargeted diuretic therapy (20–22) and allow safer navigationthrough the precarious situation of combined HF and AKI.If diuretic-resistant ﬂuid overload exists despite an opti-mized cardiac output, removal of isotonic ﬂuid can beachieved by the use of extracorporeal ultraﬁltration ( 23,24).
The presence of AKI with or without concomitant
hyperkalemia may also affect patient outcome by inhibitingthe prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldo-sterone inhibitors (drugs that have been shown in largerandomized controlled trials to increase survival in thesetting of heart failure and myocardial infarction) (25).
However, provided there is close monitoring of renal functionand potassium levels, the potential beneﬁts of these interven-tions often outweigh their risks, even in these patients.
The acute administration of beta-blockers in the setting
of type 1 CRS generally is not advised. Such therapy shouldwait until the patient has stabilized physiologically and untilconcerns about a low output syndrome have been resolved.In some patients, stroke volume cannot be increased, andrelative or absolute tachycardia sustains the adequacy ofcardiac output. Blockade of such compensatory tachycardiaand sympathetic system-dependent inotropic compensationcan precipitate cardiogenic shock with associated highmortality (26). Particular concern applies to beta-blockersexcreted by the kidney, such as atenolol or sotalol, alone orin combination with calcium antagonists (27). This shouldnot inhibit the slow, careful, titrated administration of beta-blockers later on, once patients are hemodynamically stable.
In patients with kidney dysfunction, undertreatment after
myocardial infarction is common (28). Attention should bepaid to preserving renal function, perhaps with the samevigor as we attempt to salvage and protect cardiac muscle.Worsening of renal function during admission for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is a powerful andindependent predictor of in-hospital and 1-year mortality(14,15). In patients who receive percutaneous coronaryintervention or cardiac surgery, even a small increase inserum creatinine (/H110220.3 mg/dl) is associated with increasedhospital stay and mortality (29,30). In this context, anincrease in creatinine is not simply a marker of illnessseverity but, rather, it represents the onset of AKI acting asa causative factor for cardiovascular injury accelerationthrough the activation of neurohormonal, immunologicaland inﬂammatory pathways (9,16).

protective treatments have yet emerged for this condition.
Despite some initial promising results, the use of nesiritideremains controversial, and a recent negative randomizedcontrolled trial in these very patients (31) suggests that thisagent is unlikely to have signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt.
A very speciﬁc and common threat to kidney function in
the setting of acute cardiac disease relates to the adminis-tration of radiocontrast for heart imaging procedures. Thistopic, recently reviewed in the Journal (32), would require
separate detailed discussion and is beyond the scope of thisarticle. Sufﬁce it to say that this high-risk group requiresappropriate prophylaxis to avoid radiocontrast nephropathy.Given that the presence of type 1 CRS deﬁnes a populationwith high mortality, a prompt, careful, systematic, multi-disciplinary approach involving cardiologists, nephrologists,critical care physicians, and cardiac surgeons is both logicaland desirable.
In CRS type 1, the early diagnosis of AKI remains a
challenge (33). This is also true in CRS type 3, where AKIis believed to be the primary inciting factor leading tocardiac dysfunction. In both cases, classic markers such ascreatinine increase when AKI is already established and verylittle can be done to prevent it or to protect the kidney. Aninteresting evolution in the early diagnosis of CRS has beenthe discovery of novel AKI biomarkers. With the use of acomplementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray as ascreening technique, a subset of genes whose expression isup-regulated within the ﬁrst few hours after renal injury hasbeen discovered (34,35).
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) ap-
pears to be one of the earliest markers detected in the bloodand urine of humans with AKI (36–39). Urine and serumNGAL are early predictors of AKI both in adult andchildren either in cardiac surgery or patients in the intensivecare unit (ICU) (40,41). In these patients, an increase in
creatinine is observed only 48 to 72 h later (42). NGAL
is also a biomarker of delayed graft function in kidneytransplantation (43), AKI caused by contrast-media (44),and AKI in critically ill patients admitted to intensivecare (45). Figure 1 CRS Type 1

Cystatin C appears to be a better predictor of glomerular
function than serum creatinine in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) because its blood levels are notaffected by age, gender, race, or muscle mass (46). Cystatin
C predicts AKI and the requirement for renal replacementtherapy earlier than creatinine (47). Serum cystatin C hasbeen compared with NGAL in cardiac surgery-mediatedAKI (48). Both biomarkers predicted AKI at 12 h, althoughNGAL outperformed cystatin C at earlier time points.Considering them together, they may represent a combina-tion of structural and functional damage of the kidney.
Kidney injury molecule 1 is a protein detectable in the
urine after ischemic or nephrotoxic insults to proximaltubular cells (49–51) and seems to be highly speciﬁc for
ischemic AKI. Combined with NGAL which is highlysensitive, it may represent an important marker in the earlyphases of AKI.
Biomarkers such as N-acetyl-
/H9252-(D)glucosaminidase (52),
interleukin (IL)-18 (53) and others reported in Table 1 have
been proposed as an interesting and promising contributionto diagnosis of AKI and progression of CKD. The mostlikely evolution will be a “panel” of biomarkers that includeseveral molecules both in serum and urine that combinetheir best characteristics in terms of speciﬁcity and sensitiv-ity of each marker molecule.CRS type 2 (chronic CRS). Type 2 CRS is characterized
by chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g., chroniccongestive HF) causing progressive CKD ( Fig. 2). Wors-
ening renal function in the context of HF is associated withadverse outcomes and prolonged hospitalizations (32). The
prevalence of renal dysfunction in chronic HF has beenreported to be approximately 25% (54). Even slight de-
creases in estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) signif-icantly increase mortality risk (54) and are considered amarker of severity of vascular disease (55). Independentpredictors of worsening function include old age, hyperten-sion, diabetes mellitus, and acute coronary syndromes.
The mechanisms underlying worsening renal function
likely differs based on acute versus chronic HF. Chronic HFis likely to be characterized by a long-term situation ofreduced renal perfusion, often predisposed by microvascularand macrovascular disease. Although a greater proportion ofpatients with low estimated GFR have a worse New YorkHeart Association functional class, no evidence of associa-tion between LV ejection fraction and estimated GFR canbe consistently demonstrated. Thus, patients with chronicHF and preserved LV function appear to have similarestimated GFR than patients with impaired LV (ejectionfraction /H1102145%) (55).
There is very limited understanding of the pathophys-
iology of renal dysfunction in the setting of even ad-vanced cardiac failure. In this setting, where one wouldintuitively consider hemodynamic issues to be dominant,the ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Fail-ure and Pulmonary Catheterization Effectiveness) trial (56)found no link between any pulmonary artery catheter-measured hemodynamic variables and serum creatinine in194 patients. The only link was with right atrial pressure,suggesting that renal congestion may be more importantthan appreciated. Clearly, hypoperfusion alone cannot ex-plain renal dysfunction in this setting. More work needs to
be performed to understand the mechanisms at play to developtargeted and physiologically sound approaches to treatment.
Neurohormonal abnormalities are present with excessive
production of vasoconstrictive mediators (epinephrine, an-giotensin, endothelin) and altered sensitivity and/or releaseof endogenous vasodilatory factors (natriuretic peptides,nitric oxide). Pharmacotherapies used in the managementof HF may worsen renal function. Diuresis-associatedhypovolemia, early introduction of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, and drug-induced hypoten-sion have all been suggested as contributing factors (4 ).
More recently, there has been increasing interest in the
pathogenic role of relative or absolute erythropoietin deﬁ-ciency contributing to a more pronounced anemia in thesepatients than might be expected for renal failure alone (57).Erythropoietin receptor activation in the heart may protectit from apoptosis, ﬁbrosis, and inﬂammation ( 58,59). Pre-
liminary clinical studies show that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chronic HF, CKD, andanemia lead to improved cardiac function, reduction in LVsize, and the lowering of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)(60). Patients with type 2 CRS are more likely to receiveloop diuretics and vasodilators and also to receive greaterdoses of such drugs compared with those patients withstable renal function (61). Treatment with these drugs mayparticipate in the development and progression of renalinjury. However, such therapies may simply identify patientswith severe hemodynamic compromise and, thus, a predis-position to renal dysfunction rather than being responsiblefor worsening function.
Renal insufﬁciency is highly prevalent among patients
with HF and is an independent negative prognostic factor inboth diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction and severeHF (62). The logical practical implications of the plethora

of data linking CKD with cardiovascular disease are that
more attention needs to be paid to reducing risk factors andoptimizing medications in these patients and that under-treatment due to concerns about pharmacodynamics in thissetting may have lethal consequences at an individual leveland huge potential adverse consequences at a public healthlevel. Nonetheless, it is equally important to acknowledgethat clinicians looking after these patients often are facedwith competing therapeutic choices and that, with theexception of MERIT-HF (Metoprolol Controlled-ReleaseRandomised Intervention Trial in Heart Failure) ( 63), large
randomized controlled trials that have shaped the treatmentof chronic HF in the last 2 decades have consistentlyexcluded patients with signiﬁcant renal disease. More on theuse of speciﬁc agents is covered in the sections on type 3 and4 CRS.CRS type 3 (acute renocardiac syndrome). Type 3 CRS is
characterized by an abrupt and primary worsening of kidneyfunction (e.g., AKI, ischemia, or glomerulonephritis), lead-ing to acute cardiac dysfunction (e.g., HF, arrhythmia,ischemia). Type 3 CRS appears less common than type 1CRS, but this may only be due to the fact that, unlike type1 CRS, it has not been systematically studied. AKI is agrowing disorder in hospital and ICU patients. When theRIFLE (risk, injury, and failure; loss; and end-stage kidneydisease) consensus deﬁnition is used, AKI has been identi-ﬁed in close to 9% of hospital patients ( 64). In a large ICU
database, AKI was observed in more than 35% of patients(65). Acute kidney injury can affect the heart throughseveral pathways (Fig. 3), whose hierarchy is not yetestablished. Fluid overload can contribute to the develop-ment of pulmonary edema. Hyperkalemia can contribute toarrhythmias and may cause cardiac arrest. Untreated uremiaaffects myocardial contractility through the accumulation ofmyocardial depressant factors (66) and pericarditis (67).Acidemia produces pulmonary vasoconstriction ( 68), which
can signiﬁcantly contribute to right-sided HF. Acidemiaappears to have a negative inotropic effect (69) and might,together with electrolyte imbalances, contribute to an in-creased risk of arrhythmias (70). Finally, renal ischemia

itself may precipitate activation of inﬂammation and apo-
ptosis at cardiac level (9).
A unique situation leading to type 3 CRS is bilateral
renal artery stenosis (or unilateral stenosis in a solitarykidney). Patients with this condition may be prone toacute or decompensated HF because of diastolic dysfunc-tion related to chronic increase of blood pressure fromexcessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteroneaxis, renal dysfunction with sodium and water retention,and acute myocardial ischemia from an increase inmyocardial oxygen demand related to intense peripheralvasoconstriction (71,72). In these patients, angiotensinblockade is generally required to manage the hyperten-sion and HF. However, the GFR is highly dependentupon angiotensin and signiﬁcant decompensation of kid-ney function may ensue. Although the management ofthese unusual patients has not been subject to scrutiny inlarge randomized trials, those exhibiting renal decom-pensation with ACE inhibition or ARB are likely candi-dates for renal revascularization (72).
Sensitive and speciﬁc biomarkers of cardiac injury may
help physicians to diagnose and treat type 3 CRS earlier and
perhaps more effectively (73). Cardiac troponins are bio-markers for ischemic myocardial injury (74,75), and theycorrelate with outcomes in the general population and
speciﬁcally in renal patients (76–78). A marker of myocyte
stress is BNP and allows the diagnosis of acute and acutelydecompensated chronic HF (79). It also is an independentpredictor of cardiovascular events and overall mortality inthe general population (80,81) and also in patients with
renal insufﬁciency (82–84). In HF, despite high levels ofserum BNP, its physiological effects (vasodilatory, diuretic,and natriuretic) do not appear sufﬁcient to prevent thedisease progression and CRS. Recent ﬁndings suggest aresistance to BNP (85) and/or a relative preponderance ofthe biologically inactive precursor of BNP (86). In CRStype 4 (discussed in the following text), an associationbetween increased levels of BNP and the accelerated pro-gression of nondiabetic CKD to end-stage kidney diseasehas been observed (87).
Myeloperoxidase is a marker of altered myocyte metabolism,
oxidative stress, and inﬂammation, especially in acute coronarysyndrome (88). Oxidative stress may cause myocyte apoptosisand necrosis, and it is associated with arrhythmias and endo-
thelial dysfunction with a potential role in the pathogenesis ofCRS (89). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF),IL-1, and IL-6 may have a diagnostic role as early biomarkersof CRS, but also a pathogenic role causing myocardial cell

injury and apoptosis (90,91) and mediating myocardial damage
in ischemic AKI (92).
The development of AKI can affect the use of medica-
tions normally prescribed in patients with chronic HF. Forexample, an increase in serum creatinine from 1.5 mg/dl(130
/H9262mol/l) to 2 mg/dl (177 /H9262mol/l), with diuretic therapy
and ACE inhibitors, may provoke some clinicians to de-crease or even stop diuretic prescription; they may alsodecrease or even temporarily stop ACE inhibitors. Thismay, in some cases, lead to acute decompensation of HF. Itshould be remembered that ACE inhibitors do not damagethe kidney but rather modify intrarenal hemodynamics andreduce ﬁltration fraction. They protect the kidney by reduc-ing pathological hyperﬁltration. Unless renal function failsto stabilize, or other dangerous situations arise (i.e., hypo-tension, hyperkalemia) continued treatment with ACEinhibitors and ARBs may be feasible.
Finally, if AKI is severe and renal replacement therapy is
necessary, cardiovascular instability generated by rapid ﬂuidand electrolyte shifts secondary to conventional dialysis caninduce hypotension, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia(93). Continuous techniques of renal replacement, whichminimize such cardiovascular instability, appear physiolog-ically safer and more logical in this setting (94).CRS type 4 (chronic renocardiac syndrome). Type 4
CRS is characterized by a condition of primary CKD (e.g.,chronic glomerular disease) contributing to decreased car-diac function, ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunc-tion, and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events(Fig. 4). Today, CKD is divided into 5 stages based on acombination of severity of kidney damage and GFR (95).
When these criteria are used, current estimates of CKD
account for at least 11% of the U.S. adult population ( 96),
thus becoming a major public health problem. In fact CKDtoday includes individuals with serum creatinine levelspreviously dismissed as not representative of signiﬁcantrenal dysfunction.
Individuals with CKD are at extremely high cardiovas-
cular risk (97). More than 50% of deaths in CKD stage 5
cohorts are attributed to cardiovascular disease. The 2-yearmortality rate after myocardial infarction in patients withCKD stage 5 is estimated to be 50% (98). In comparison,the 10-year mortality rate post-infarct for the generalpopulation is 25%. Patients with CKD have between a 10-and 20-fold increased risk of cardiac death compared withage-/gender-matched control subjects without CKD (98–100). Part of this problem may be related to the fact thatsuch individuals are also less likely to receive risk-modifyinginterventions compared to their non-CKD counterparts ( 101).
Less severe forms of CKD also may be associated with
signiﬁcant cardiovascular risk. Evidence for increasing cardio-vascular disease morbidity and mortality tracking with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction (stages 1 to 3) has mainlystemmed from community-based studies ( 102–105). These
studies documented an inverse relationship between renalfunction and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (consistently
occurring at estimated GFR levels /H1102160 ml/min/1.73 m
2).
Among high-risk cohorts, baseline creatinine clearance is
a signiﬁcant and independent predictor of short-term out-comes, namely death and myocardial infarction (99). Similarﬁndings also were noted among patients presenting withST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( 106), an effect
independent of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarctionrisk score (107).
In large-scale studies (e.g., SOLVD [Studies Of Left
Ventricular Dysfunction], TRACE [Trandolapril CardiacEvaluation], SAVE [Survival And Ventricular Enlarge-ment], and VALIANT [Valsartan in Acute MyocardialInfarction]) in which the authors excluded individuals withbaseline serum creatinine of /H113502.5 mg/dl, reduced renal
function was associated with signiﬁcantly greater mortalityand adverse cardiovascular event rates (108–111).
Adverse cardiovascular outcomes in renal patients are
associated with plasma levels of speciﬁc biomarkers(112–114). Troponins, asymmetric dimethylarginine,
plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1, homocysteine, na-triuretic peptides, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid Aprotein, hemoglobin, and ischemia-modiﬁed albumin arebiomarkers whose levels correlate with cardiovascular out-comes in patients with CKD (115–117). These observationsprovide a mechanistic link between chronic inﬂammation(118), subclinical infections (119), accelerated atherosclero-
sis, heart–kidney interactions, and negative cardiovascularand renal outcomes.
The proportion of individuals with CKD receiving ap-
propriate cardiovascular risk modiﬁcation treatment is lowerthan in the general population. This “therapeutic nihilism”(120) is based on the concern of worsening kidney function
(121,122) and leads to treating /H1102150% of patients with CKD
with the combination of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhib-itors, and statins (123). In a cohort involving /H11022140,000
patients, 1,025 with documented CKD were less likely toreceive aspirin, beta-blockade, or ACE inhibition afterinfarction than patients without CKD. Yet CKD patientshad 30-day mortality risk reductions similar to non-CKDpatients when receiving the drug combination (123).
Potential reasons for this subtherapeutic performance
include concerns about further worsening of renal function,and/or therapy-related toxic effects due to low clearancerates (124,125). Many medications necessary for manage-ment of complications of advanced CKD generally areconsidered safe with concomitant cardiac disease. Theseinclude regimens for calcium-phosphate balance and hyper-parathyroidism, vitamins, and erythropoiesis-stimulatingagents (126–129). The same appears to hold true for novelregimens, for instance, endothelin system antagonists,adenosine and vasopressin receptor antagonists, and in-ﬂammation suppressors (130–133). For immunosuppres-sive drugs, controversy exists regarding the effects ofcertain agents on the heart, indicating a need for moreresearch in the area (134).1533 JACC Vol. 52, No. 19, 2008 Ronco et al.

Bleeding concerns contribute to the decreased likelihood
of patients with severe CKD receiving aspirin and/or
clopidogrel despite the minor bleeding risk and beneﬁts thatare sustained in these patients (135). Other medicationsrequiring thorough considerations of pros and cons includediuretics, digitalis, calcium-channel blockers, and nesiritide(136–141). Nevertheless, when appropriately titrated andmonitored, cardiovascular medications can be safely admin-istered to CKD patients with beneﬁts similar to the generalpopulation (142).
Lack of CKD population-speciﬁc treatment effect data
makes therapeutic choices particularly challenging. In particu-lar, in patients with advanced CKD, the initiation or increaseddosage of ACE inhibitors or ARBs can precipitate clinicallysigniﬁcant worsening of renal function or marked hyperkale-mia. The latter may be dangerously exacerbated by the use ofFigure 4 CRS Type 4

aldosterone antagonists. Such patients, if aggressively treated,
become exposed to a signiﬁcant risk of developing dialysisdependence or life-threatening hyperkalemic arrhythmias. Yet,if too cautiously treated, they may develop equally life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
It is comforting to note that up to a 30% increase in
creatinine that stabilizes within 2 months was actuallyassociated with long-term nephroprotection in a systematicreview of 12 randomized controlled studies (143). Thisresult leads to the practical advice that ACE inhibitors andARBs can be cautiously used in patients with CKD,provided the serum creatinine does not increase beyond thisamount and potassium remains consistently /H110215.6 mmol/l.
Regarding patients with end-stage renal disease, and inparticular those with anuria and a tendency to hyperkalemiainterdialytically, the administration of ACE inhibitors orARBs may be problematic; however, even the combination
of these medications has been used safely in select popula-tions (144). At present, most end-stage kidney disease
patients with LV dysfunction seem to be undertreated withACE inhibitors or ARBs (145).With respect to aldosterone blockade, drugs such as spi-
ronolactone have been widely used for severe HF patients with
evidence of beneﬁcial effects on morbidity and mortality ( 146).
Concerns have been raised, however, about the use of aldoste-rone blockade, particularly in conjunction with angiotensinblockade, since after publication of RALES (RandomizedAldactone Evaluation Study) (146), prescriptions for spirono-lactone and rates of hospitalizations and mortality related tohyperkalemia increased sharply (147). Proper patient selection,
including patients with diminished LV ejection fraction andexcluding ones with moderate CKD (creatinine level /H113502.5
mg/dl) or hyperkalemia /H110225 mmol/l, would help minimize
potential life-threatening hyperkalemia (140).
CRS type 5 (secondary CRS). Type 5 CRS is character-
ized by the presence of combined cardiac and renal dysfunc-tion due to acute or chronic systemic disorders (Fig. 5).
There is limited systematic information on type 5 CRS,
although there is an appreciation that as more organs failin this setting, mortality increases. There is limitedinsight into how combined renal and cardiovascularfailure may differentially affect such an outcome com-

pared to, for example, combined pulmonary and renal
failure. Nonetheless, it is clear that several acute andchronic diseases can affect both organs simultaneouslyand that the disease induced in one can affect the otherand vice versa. Examples include sepsis, diabetes, amy-loidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis.Several chronic conditions such as diabetes and hyper-tension may contribute to type 2 and 4 CRS.
In the acute setting, severe sepsis represents the most
common and serious condition which can affect both organs. Itcan induce AKI while leading to profound myocardial depres-sion. The mechanisms responsible for such changes are poorlyunderstood but may involve the effect of TNF and othermediators on both organs (148,149). The onset of myocardialfunctional depression and a state of inadequate cardiac outputcan further decrease renal function as discussed in type 1 CRS,and the development of AKI can affect cardiac function asdescribed in type 3 CRS. Renal ischemia may then inducefurther myocardial injury (9 ) in a vicious cycle, which is
injurious to both organs. Treatment is directed at the promptidentiﬁcation, eradication, and treatment of the source ofinfection while supporting organ function with invasivelyguided ﬂuid resuscitation in addition to inotropic and vaso-pressor drug support.
In this setting, all the principles discussed for type 1 and 3
CRS apply. In these septic patients, preliminary data derivedfrom the use of more intensive renal replacement technologysuggest that blood puriﬁcation may have a role in improvingmyocardial performance while providing optimal small soluteclearance (150). Despite the emergence of consensus deﬁni-tions (151) and many studies (152,153), no therapies have yetemerged to prevent or attenuate AKI in critically ill patients.However, evidence of the injurious effects of pentastarch ﬂuidresuscitation in septic AKI recently has emerged ( 154). Such
therapy should, therefore, be avoided in septic patients.
Conclusions
In both chronic and acute situations, an appreciation of the
interaction between heart and kidney during dysfunction ofeach or both organs has practical clinical implications. Thedepth of knowledge and complexity of care necessary to offerbest therapy to these patients demands a multidisciplinaryapproach, combining the expertise of cardiology, nephrology,and critical care. In addition, achievement of a consensusdeﬁnition for each type of cardiorenal syndrome will allowphysicians to describe treatments and interventions that arefocused and pathophysiologically sound. It will also help toconduct and compare epidemiological studies in differentcountries and more easily identify aspects of each syndrome.This is a priority for improvement and further research.Randomized controlled trials can then be designed to targetinterventions aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality inthese increasingly common conditions. Developing awareness,the ability to identify and deﬁne, and physiological understand-ing will help improve the outcome of these complex patients.Acknowledgments
