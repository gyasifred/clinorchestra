Continues on next pageNearly 22% 
of the US population is 
expected to be 65+ by 20401 
and with a subsequent increase in chronic 
conditions, the rate of those with (or at-risk of) malnutrition is on the rise. Early identification of malnutrition risk is the first step in the fight against malnutrition across all healthcare settings, including the community setting. Nutrition screening within the community setting for older adults continues to be a challenge despite a number of available validated screening tools. This practice tool addresses validated screening tools specifically in older adults.
Nutrition Screening
ASPEN recommends the use of a validated nutrition screening tool to identify malnutrition risk.
2 
Nutrition Screening is not Nutrition Assessment
Screening identifies risk for a specific 
outcome like undernutrition or functional decline.
Assessment is a further level of evaluation 
to clarify etiology, severity, and appropriate intervention.Select Nutrition Screening Tools and Populations for Use in Adult Patients

MNA® (Mini Nutritional Assessment) Nutrition Screening Tool 
•Mini N utritional Assessment at
mna-elderly.com was specifically developed
for nutrition screening in the elderly withseveral questions about functional status.
•
It ha
s become the most widespread
screening tool for adults 65 years and older.The MNA
®-SF (Short-form), now known as the
MNA® was developed to be a more practical
shorter screening tool to be used by clinicianswith 6 questions and can be completed in5 minutes or less. It has been translated intoover 40 languages and used worldwide.
•
T
he Self-MNA® is a validated self-administered
nutrition screening tool that older adults orfamily/caregivers can complete. It is availablein over 15 languages. (see Figure at right).

Home-Delivered Meals (HDM) Programs 
•79 par ticipants ages 60 and older with nutrition risk were enrolled in this HDM pre-post study which aimed to
measure changes in nutrition risk after 3 months of HDMs.
•Of t
hose who were screened using the MNA®-SF, 42% were identified as malnourished upon enrollment and
only 8% were identified as malnourished at the three-month follow up.9
Veterans Administration (VA) Home Based Primary Care Program (HBPC)
•2 ,252 veterans ages 65 and older from 18 HBPC programs from across the country had prevalence of
malnutrition of 15% and prevalence of at risk for malnutrition was 40.3% using the MNA®-SF.
•A
uthors concluded that the MNA®-SF is an efficient nutrition screening tool, and it can be successfully used for
elderly veterans.10
Hospital Affiliated Outpatient Clinic 
•618 pa tients 60 years and older completed a pre-post outpatient clinic nutrition-focused quality improvement
program, where upon enrollment using the MNA®-SF, 85% were at risk of malnutrition and 15% were
malnourished. Follow up measurements at 90 days included MNA® scores where 52% of participants (n=324)
had an increase in MNA® scores and improved nutritional status (p<0.001).
•A
uthors concluded all older adults receiving care in outpatient clinics should be routinely screened for
nutritional status and institute appropriate nutritional care.11Key Messages
 Use nutrition screening tools that 
are age appropriate and validated 
for the intended population, setting, and objectives.
 Comprehensive nutrition 
screening programs are recommended for all care settings and should trigger assessment, intervention, and monitoring as indicated.
 Future goals for nutrition risk 
screening in older adults include settings such as primary care offices, outpatient/community/retail clinics, pharmacies, home delivered meal programs, food banks, and more.
 MNA®-SF and Self-MNA® are 
validated nutrition screening tools for use in older adults.
