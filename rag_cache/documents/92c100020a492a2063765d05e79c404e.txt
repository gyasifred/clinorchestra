It is essential that in the documentation of the diag-
nosis of malnutrition, the neonatal dietitian is thorough
in the assessment of the infant. All data available related
to the diagnosis of malnutrition should be assessed. The
assessment,thediagnosis,andthereasonforthediagno-

tionmonitoring.Therefore,weightgainvelocitygoalsand

Howareweightgaingoalsdetermined?
First, it is appropriate to discuss the purpose of a weight
gainvelocitygoal,andthatistomaintainastablegrowth
trajectory on an established growth curve. Greer and
Olsen6suggestthatinfantswhoareappropriateforgesta-
tionalage(AGA)andinfantswhoaresmallforgestational

tionproviderstodeterminethebestgrowthgoal/trajectory
foreachinfantintheircare.
Weight gain goals can be established using PediTools,
an online tool ( https://peditools.org/ ).8See Table1for a
description of this tool. In the example from PediTools
(Table2), a male infant at 32 3/7 weeks old needs to
gain214gtomaintaincurrentweightpercentile.However,
these goals’ projected growth rate maintains the current
rate of growth. Optimal growth of infants for whom the
currentrateofgrowthissuboptimalmaybehigher.Addi-
tionalgrowthforrecoveryfrommalnutritionmaybewar-
rantedbutisnotincludedinthePediToolsgoal.Additional
nutritionmaybeneededduringtherecoveryperiod.
Other stated goals in the literature include the goals
of 15–20 g/kg/day for infants <2000 g and 25–35 g/day
for infants >2000 g.5The growth velocity for the neona-
tal malnutrition indicators did not recommend use of
these goals, as they can underestimate the amount of
weight gain needed to maintain a stable weight-for-age
trajectory.8

Whatarespecialconsiderationsfor
diagnosingmalnutritionintheSGAinfant?
Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with short-
term and long-term complications such as poor growth
and subtle to major cognitive and neurodevelopmental
outcomes as well as adult-onset disease.18SGA preterm
infants without subsequent recovery growth were more
likely to have poor long-term developmental outcomes
than infants with recovery growth.19Recovery growth in
SGAinfantsoccursmostrapidlyuptoacorrectedageof4
monthsbutcancontinueuntil6yearsofage.20,21Hernan-
dezetalreportedthatverylow-birth-weightSGAinfants
grew faster after reaching term than their AGA counter-
partssuchthat93%ofinfantswerenolongerSGAat1year
ofage.22ComparedwithterminfantswhoareAGAorlarge
for gestational age (LGA), SGA term infants have signif-
icantly lower fat mass at birth. They increase their body
weight and length at a significantly higher rate between
birthand3–4months.Theyincreasetheirfatmassby23
times vs 2.8 times for LGA infants between birth and 3–
4monthsofage.At3–4monthsofage,LGAinfantstend
to reach a threshold in body fat mass (as measured by
percentageofbodymass),whereasSGAinfantswerestillacquiringbodyfat.17Theauthorsconcludethatthediffer-
encemaybedueinparttofeedingmethodology,asalarger
percentageofLGAinfantswerebreastfedondemandcom-
paredwithSGAinfants.
In the first 2 weeks of life, this population is expected
to have a weight gain velocity above the norm. There-
fore, SGA infants who meet the “days to regain birth
weight” indicator for malnutrition in combination with
anotherappropriateindicator,suchasinadequateenergy
and/or protein intake, should receive a diagnosis of
malnutrition.16,17
Whatareappropriategrowthexpectations

LimiteddataareavailableontheexpectedgrowthofLGA

Daviesetal24reportedaslowerthanaverageweightgainin

during the first 3 months of life in LGA infants. More
recently, Taal et al25confirmed a “catch-down” or down-
ward trajectory in growth in both weight and length in
LGA infants, mainly occurring during the first 3 months
oflife,leadingtoasubstantialrealignmentonallgrowth
parameters compared with infants born AGA. Bocca-
Tjeertes et al26found that LGA preterm infants gained

thecriteriaformalnutrition.Itmaybeappropriateforan
infant born LGA to have a decline in weight-for-age z-

Whencalculatingthedeclinein

shouldthisindicatorbeusedtodiagnose

Greer and Olsen maintain that AGA infants and SGA
infants should maintain a rate of weight gain and length
gainthatisconsistentwiththeirbirthpercentiles’ z-scores
andnotwiththepercentilethatoccurssubsequenttotheir
postnataldiuresis.6Therefore,itisreasonabletousebirth

wide range of the gestational age of infants in the NICU
population.
Howshouldnutrientintakebeassessed
duringthetransitionfromparenteralto
enteralnutrition?
As with the weight and length indicators, clinical judg-
ment is important when assessing nutrient intake, as
there are no specific caloric and protein recommenda-
tionsforthetransitionphaseofnutritionsupport.Nutrient
intake estimates can be based on the percentage of calo-riesandproteinfromparenteralfeedingsandthepercent-
ageofcaloriesandproteinfromenteralfeedings.Themid-
points of requirements from enteral and parenteral feed-
ing, respectively, can be multiplied by the percentage for
eachandthenaddedtogether.
Consider, for example, a 2-week-old preterm infant,
now280/7weeksold,withrespiratorydistresssyndrome.
Parenteral nutrition (PN) provides 65% of nutrition, and
enteralnutrition(EN)provides35%ofnutrition.
ThePNgoalrangeis85–111kcal/kg.Themidpointis98
kcal/kg×65%=64kcal/kg.
The EN goal range is 110–130 kcal/kg. The midpoint is
120kcal/kg ×35%=42kcal/kg.
The calorie goal for this patient is 64 +42 or 106
kcal/kg/day.
ThePNproteingoalrangeis3–4g/kg,andtheENpro-
tein goalrange is 3.5–4.5 g/kg. The protein intake goal of

Thisquestionhastwoparts,soletusfirstdiscusstheuse
ofbothindicatorsandtheintendedpopulationsforclarifi-
cation.
The population that should be evaluated using the
preterm/neonatalmalnutritionindicatorsincludesinfants
bornat<37weeks’PMAandinfantswhoareyoungerthan
30 DOL. The population that should be evaluated using
thepediatricmalnutritionindicatorsincludesterminfants
whowerebornat37weeks’PMAorlaterandwhoarenow
older than 30 DOL. The original intent for the pediatric
malnutrition indicators was to exclude neonates because
postnatalweightlosswasaconfoundingissueforthediag-
nosis of pediatric malnutrition. Figure 1provides clari-
fication on when to use the preterm/neonatal indicators
andwhentousethepediatricindicators(doesnotprovide
informationonselectionofgrowthchart).
Several of the indicators are common to both the
pretermandpediatricpopulations.Theseincludeexpected
percentageofweightgainvelocityandpercentageofesti-
mated nutrient intake for energy and protein. Both or
either of these could continue to be used for the identifi-
cationanddiagnosisofmalnutritionregardlessoftheges-
tationalorchronologicalageoftheinfant.
Theindicatorsofdeclineinweight-for-age z-score,days

andlineargrowthvelocityarespecifictothepretermmal-
nutritionindicators.Weight-for-length z-score, decline in weight-for-length
z-score,andlength-for-age z-scorearespecifictothepedi-
atricmalnutritionindicators.
Now to the question of when to utilize each indicator
and/orhoworwhentotransitionfromthepretermindica-
torstothepediatricindicators.
The preterm/neonatal malnutrition indicators are
intendedtobeusedforinfantsthatarepreterm—thatis,
infants born at <37 weeks’ PMA and term infants until
they are 30 days old. Figure 1provides details on the
initialdeterminationofwhethertousepreterm/neonatal
indicators or pediatric indicators and when to switch to
thepediatricindicators.
In the NICU, when the neonatal RDN finds that the
infantmeetsthecriteriaformalnutritionusingthepreterm
indicators and makes the nutrition diagnosis, assigns a
levelofseverity,anddocumentsthediagnosisusingthese
criteria,thosecriteriashouldcontinuetobeuseduntilthe
malnutritionresolves.Ifthisinfantshould“ageout”ofthe
premature criteria during that time, the diagnostic crite-
ria should not change until the malnutrition resolves. In
other words, once a diagnosis has been made using a set
of criteria, it is reasonable to continue to use those crite-
ria until the malnutrition resolves regardless of the PMA
oftheinfant.

For example, consider two infants newly admitted to
the hospital with a PMA of 41 weeks. Infant 1 is born at
32 weeks’ gestational age and is 9 weeks old (PMA of 41
weeks);infant2isaterminfantbornat37weeksandisnow

Whydoeslineargrowthrequireasecond
indicator?
Lineargrowthvelocityrequiresasecondindicatorbecause
of the difficulty of obtaining accurate length measure-
ments.Measurementsobtainedusingameasuringtapeor
nonstandardlengthboardarefrequentlyinaccuratewhen
compared with measurements using recommended mea-
surementtechniques.31Additionally,weightgainwillfal-
ter before linear growth falters. Evaluation of nutrient
intake may be the preferred indicator, as linear growth
requiresadequateprotein,calories,andothernutrients.
CONCLUSION
The article “Identifying Malnutrition in Preterm and
Neonatal Populations: Recommended Indicators,” pub-
lishedinthe JournaloftheAcademyofNutritionandDietet-
ics,hasprovidedastartingpointforidentifyinganddocu-
mentingneonatalmalnutrition.1Aswecontinuetoexplore
themanyquestionsraisedbytheidentificationofmalnu-
trition in this population, we must also begin to address
the need to document outcomes and validate the indica-
tors.Continuedeffortstoaddressbestpracticesinapplying
