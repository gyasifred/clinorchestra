Keywords:Acute coronary syndromeRisk score
Chest pain
Emergency roomHEART scoreBackground: The focus of the diagnostic process in chest pain patients at the emergency department is to
identify both low and high risk patients for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The HEART score was
designed to facilitate this process. This study is a prospective validation of the HEART score.
Methods: A total of 2440 unselected patients presented with chest pain at the cardiac emergency department
of ten participating hospitals in The Netherlands. The HEART score was assessed as soon as the ﬁrst lab results
and ECG were obtained. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with-in 6 weeks.
Secondary endpoints were (i) the occurrence of AMI and death, (ii) ACS and (iii) the performance of a coro-nary angiogram. The performance of the HEART score was compared with the TIMI and GRACE scores.Results: Low HEART scores (values 0 –3) were calculated in 36.4% of the patients. MACE occurred in 1.7%. In
patients with HEART scores 4 –6, MACE was diagnosed in 16.6%. In patients with high HEART scores (values
7–10), MACE occurred in 50.1%. The c-statistic of the HEART score (0.83) is signi ﬁcantly higher than the
c-statistic of TIMI (0.75)and GRACE (0.70) respectively (p b0.0001).
Conclusion: The HEART score provides the clinician with a quick and reliable predictor of outcome, without
computer-required calculating. Low HEART scores (0 –3), exclude short-term MACE with >98% certainty.
In these patients one might consider reserved policies. In patients with high HEART scores (7 –10) the high
risk of MACE may indicate more aggressive policies.

1. Introduction
Chest pain is the most common reason for admitting patients to
the cardiac emergency department [1,2]. The ﬁrst challenge in these
patients is to identify those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).This diagnostic process should be quick and ef ﬁcient, since the prog-
nosis improves dramatically when ACS patients receive targeted
treatment as early as possible [3]. In today's practice, approximately
80% of chest pain patients have no clear ACS at presentation [4]. Clini-
cians tend to postpone the decision making process and to admitthese patients for clinical observation, meanwhile treating the pa-
tients as an ACS. Consequently, over diagnosis and unnecessary treat-
ment are common, resulting in redundant patient burden and high
cost. In order to improve risk strati ﬁcation of all cause chest patients
at the emergency department and to place relative arguments for ACSinto perspective, we designed the HEART score ( Table 1 ).International Journal of Cardiology 168 (2013) 2153 –2158

HEART was not developed from a database as modern scores often
are. The HEART score was based on clinical experience and medical lit-
erature and designed to be as easy to use as the Apgar score for new-
borns [5]. HEART is an acronym of its components: History, ECG, Age,
Risk factors and Troponin. Each of these may be scored with 0, 1 or 2points. We retrospectively evaluated the HEART score in two smaller
studies and obtained promising results [6,7]. This resulted in the pro-
spective study in 2440 patients at 10 sites described in this paper. Wecompared the performance of the HEART score with other scoring sys-
tems, such as TIMI [8]and GRACE [9–11], although both have been
designed for risk strati ﬁcation of patients with proven ACS and not
for the chest pain population at the emergency department.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
This study was performed at ten hospitals in the Netherlands. Participating hospi-
tals and numbers of included patients are listed in Appendix A . Any patient admitted to
the (cardiac) emergency department due to chest pain irrespective of age, pre-hospital
suspicions and previous medical treatment was eligible. Patients presenting with onlydyspnea or palpitations were not included. Only patients presenting to the emergencydepartment were eligible for the study. Typically, patients with chest pain and signi ﬁ-
cant ST segment elevations on the ECG during transportation in the ambulance wereimmediately taken to the nearest available coronary intervention room in the area
and, consequently, not presented at the emergency department. Therefore, patients
with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) were only exceptionally includ-ed in this study. The ethics committees of all participating hospitals approved thestudy. As this was an observational non-intervention study, informed consent proce-dures were waived. However, patients were informed of the registration of data andthe follow up policy.
2.2. Data acquisition and management
Emergency department residents of participating hospitals were instructed care-
fully about the admission Case Report Form (CRF) and interpretation of the elements
of patient history. The resident entered the initial patient data in writing on the admis-sion CRF, upon arrival of the patient. The CRF consisted of separate entries for classicalelements of patient history, cardiovascular risk factors, medication, physical examina-tion and past medical history.
Laboratory values, including troponin I or T levels, were collected throughout the
study period, starting with the moment of admission and typically repeated with 6 hintervals. According to the original study design the measured troponin values wereinterpreted according to local lab standards and reference values (see Appendix A ).
Only the troponin value of the ﬁrst blood sample was used for the HEART score calcu-
lation. High sensitive troponin was not used at any participating hospital at the time ofthe study conduct.
A copy of the admission ECG was added to the study ﬁles. The ECG was blindly
reviewed and classi ﬁed afterwards by independent, experienced cardiologists, according
to the Minnesota criteria [12]. In case of disagreement, a third cardiologist was consulted.
A secured web based database was built for this study. An algorithm was devised to calcu-late the TIMI [8],G R A C E [9–11]and HEART [6,7] scores automatically from the admission
data, without interpretations by the investigators.2.3. HEART score criteria
The HEART score was calculated on admission data only. Data acquired more than
1 h after presentation were ignored for score calculations.
For speci ﬁc explanation of each HEART element, please see previous publications
[6,7].
2.4. Follow-up
Follow up data were retrieved from digital and written patient records, including
discharge letters, revascularization reports and any other relevant documentation.
In a few cases where follow-up data were not available from hospital records, the
patient or their general practitioner was called to obtain information on their condi-
tion, hospital admissions, myocardial infarction and revascularization.
2.5. Outcomes
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was made according the appli-
cable guidelines when the protocol was written, the joint ESC-ACCF-AHA-WHF task
force for the rede ﬁnition of myocardial infarction [13], and consisted of a rise and fall
of troponin values with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper refer-
ence limit together with evidence of myocardial ischemia. Within the diagnosis of AMI,distinction was made between either: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), de-
ﬁned as a syndrome consisting of a rise and fall of troponin values as described above,
typical patient history and transient ST segment elevations on the consecutive 12 lead
ECGs, or non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), de ﬁned as a syndrome
consisting of a rise and fall of troponin values as described above, typical patient historyand persistent or transient ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion, ﬂat T-waves,
pseudo-normalization of T-waves, or no changes at presentation.
In case of rises of troponin levels without evidence of myocardial ischemia or in
case of non-availability of data the case was discussed in the adjudication committee
where a ﬁnal diagnosis was made according to the guidelines [3,13,14] .
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was de ﬁned as any therapeutic catheter
intervention in the coronary arteries. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was
deﬁned as any cardiac surgery in which coronary arteries were operated on.
The primary endpoint in this study was the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac
event (MACE), within six weeks of initial presentation. MACE consists of: AMI, PCI,CABG, coronary angiography revealing procedurally correctable stenosis managed con-servatively, and death due to any cause.
Coronary angiography revealing procedurally correctable stenosis managed con-
servatively was de ﬁned as signi ﬁcant coronary stenosis thought to be the cause of
the chest pain, but revascularization was withheld for reasons of co-morbidity or riskof complications.
2.6. Secondary endpoints
Secondary endpoints were: (i) the six-week occurrence of AMI and death, (ii) the
diagnosis of ACS within three months after presentation. The spectrum of ACS was de-
scribed according to the de ﬁnitions in the guideline for non-ST-segment elevation
acute coronary syndrome [3,14] and
 consisted of: de ﬁnite ACS, de ﬁned as: STEMI or
NSTEMI (as de ﬁned above), or suspected ACS, de ﬁned as: likely to be an ACS based
on typical patient history consistent with unstable angina and/or ST segment depres-sion or T wave inversion or signi ﬁcant stenosis at coronary angiography, but without
a rise of troponin levels, (iii) the performance of coronary angiography within three
months after presentation.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with R (Version 2.9; The R foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) [15]. Descriptive statistics are given as average+/ −SD, per-
centage or Kaplan –Meier cumulative event-free curve. Differences between groups were
assessed by means of the Student's t-test when normally distributed. For scalar data we
used the Fisher's exact test, or for ordinal data the Cochran –Armitage Trend Test.
The probability of reaching an endpoint was calculated as the percentage of cases
with an endpoint within a given category. The area under the receiver operator char-
acteristic curve (c-statistic) was computed in order to give a measure of diagnostic dis-criminative strength, combining sensitivity and speci ﬁcity, especially for non-binomial
variables. The DeLong's test was used for testing two correlated ROC curves. Statisticalsigniﬁcance was de ﬁned as p b0.05 two-sided.

The HEART score is composed of 5 components: history, electrocardiogram (ECG), age,risk factors and troponin. For each component 0, 1 or 2 points is given (see methods forfurther details).2154 B.E. Backus et al. / International Journal of Cardiology 168 (2013) 2153 –2158
the 6-week follow up was incomplete. The study population consisted
of the remainder of 2388 patients with a follow up duration of
222+/−127 days (mean+/ −SD). The total follow up duration of the
entire study group was 1449 patient years. Patient characteristics ofthe study group are presented in Table 2 .
3.2. Primary end points
Of a total of 2388 patients 407 (17.0%) were diagnosed with MACE
within 6 weeks: AMI was diagnosed in 155 patients (6.4%), 251 patients
(10.5%) underwent PCI, 67 patients (2.8%) had a CABG and 44 patients
(1.8%) had coronary angiography revealing procedurally correctable
stenosis managed conservatively. Sixteen patients (0.7%) died within
6 weeks after presentation. Thirteen patients died of a cardiac cause: 1
patient in the low-risk HEART group, 5 in the intermediate-riskHEART group and 7 in the high-risk HEART group. Three of these 16 pa-tients died due to non-cardiovascular causes. Altogether, 533 MACE oc-
curred in 407 patients: an average of 1.30 events/MACE patient.
3.3. Diagnosis at admission
On admission, the 2388 patients that were analyzed were diag-
nosed as follows:
419 (17.5%) acute coronary syndrome, 144 (6.0%) AMI of which 2
died at the ED, 230 (9.6%) stable angina, 68 (2.8%) rhythm, 90 (3.8%)
other cardiac diseases, 106 (4.4%) gastro-esophagitis, 347 (14.5%)
other non-cardiac diagnoses, 984 (41.2%) with atypical/undifferentiatedchest pain.
Eventually 142/155 AMIs (91.6%) were diagnosed at presentation:
110 NSTEMI, 18 STEMI and 14 recent AMI (onset 12 –48 h before pre-
sentation). Mean duration of time to AMI was 0.3 days (range 0 –17).
165/407 (40.8%) of MACE were reached upon presentation. Mean dura-
tion of time to MACE was 5.6 days (range 0 –41). Mean time to PCI
6.9 days (0 –41), mean time to CABG 12.1 (1 –39) days and mean time
to death 13.6 days (1 –33). The time elapsed between arrival of the pa-
tient and the occurrence of MACE is given in Fig. 2 .
3.4. The HEART score
The numerical distribution of the HEART score's ﬁve elements in
the groups with or without endpoints is shown in Table 3 .
Theﬁve elements of the HEART score differed signi ﬁcantly between
the groups with and without MACE. The average HEART score was3.96+/ −2.0 in the non-MACE group and 6.54+/ −1.7 in the MACE
group.
The c-statistic of the HEART score in the entire study group was 0.83.
The HEART score retained its discriminative ability in three relevant sub-groups: in diabetics the event rate was 81/440 with a c-statistic of 0.78
(non-diabetic 0.84), in females (event rate 116/1016) the c-statistic
was 0.83 (males 0.82) and in elderly over the age of 75 (event rate
101/490) the c-statistic was 0.73 (age ≤75 0.86).

The c-statistic of troponin only was 0.70. With addition of the ECG
the c-statistic improved signi ﬁcantly to a value 0.78, with a likelihood
ration test p-value of b0.001. This combination of troponin plus ECG
only had a signi ﬁcantly poorer performance as compared with the
complete HEART score (p b0.001).
3.5. HEART, TIMI and GRACE scores
Average values of the HEART, TIMI and GRACE scores in groups with
and without MACE are given in Table 4 . All scores differed considerably
between the group free from MACE and the group with MACE. Fig. 3
illustrates the relation between the scores (on the x-axis) and the risk
of MACE within 6 weeks after initial presentation (on the y-axis).
Comparison of the c-statistics as represented in Table 4 shows a
value of 0.83 for the HEART score, 0.75 for TIMI and 0.70 for GRACE.
The HEART score performed signi ﬁcantly better (p b0.001) as compared
with TIMI and GRACE.
3.6. Predictive values of low scores
The low risk boundaries for all scores were set at a risk of MACE b5%.
In the group with TIMI scores of 0 –1, which accounted for 34.0% of the
study population, 23/811 (2.8%) had a MACE. The 14.0% of the patients
who had GRACE scores 0 –60 had MACE in 10/335 (2.9%) of the cases.
The group with a low HEART score (values 0 –3) represents 36.4% of
the study population. Six-week MACE occurred in 15/870 (1.7%) of
these patients. This included nine AMIs, nine PCI, three CABG and one
death. This 20 year old male committed suicide, seven days after the
index chest pain event.3.7. Predictive values of intermediate scores
The intermediate risk boundaries for all scores were set at a risk of
MACE between 5 and 40%.In the group with TIMI scores of 2 –5, which
accounted for 62.7% of the study population, 350/1497 (23.4%) had a
MACE. The 85.7% of the patients who had GRACE scores >60 had
MACE in 389/2012 (19.3%) of the cases. The group with an intermedi-
ate HEART score (values 4 –6) represents 46.1% of the study popula-
tion. Six-week MACE occurred in 183/1101 (16.6%) of these patients.
3.8. Predictive values of high scores
Only the TIMI and HEART scores reached a high risk level, de ﬁned
as a risk of MACE>40%. MACE occurred in 34/80 patients (42.5%)
where TIMI scores were 6 –7. The group with a high HEART score
(7–10) represents 17.5% of the study population; six-week MACE
occurred in 209/417 (50.1%) of those patients.
3.9. Secondary endpoints
A total of 164/2388 (6.9%) patients had an AMI (n=155) or died
(n=16) within six weeks. The c-statistics for the occurrence of AMI
or death of HEART, TIMI and GRACE are 0.82, 0.70 and 0.71 respec-
tively (p b0.0001).
An ACS within three months after presentation was diagnosed in
536 patients (22.4%); 501 of these 536 ACS (93.4%) were already di-agnosed during primary admission.
The c-statistics for the occurrence of ACS shows a value of 0.86 for
the HEART score, 0.78 for TIMI and 0.72 for GRACE (p b0.0001).
Coronary angiography within three months was performed in 578
patients (24.2%). In 93 (16.2%) of these cases this diagnostic proce-
dure was performed during primary admission. The results were: 58
(10.0%) normal coronaries, 104 (17.9%) non-signi ﬁcant stenosis, 44
(7.6%) signi ﬁcant stenosis with conservative treatment, 361 (62.4%)
signiﬁcant stenosis requiring revascularization and 11 (1.9%) were
unclassi ﬁed.
The 
HEART score was 3.9+/ −2.0 in the group with no catheteri-
zation in the ﬁrst three months and 6.0+/ −1.8 in the group with a
catheterization in the ﬁrst three months (p b0.001).
4. Discussion
The use of the HEART score for chest pain patients at the emergency
department provides the clinician with a reliable predictor of outcome,

very soon after the arrival of the patient, based on already available clin-
ical data and without computer-required calculating.
The favorable results of this large prospective validation study con-
ﬁrm our previous retrospective evaluation studies [6,7]. A c-statistic of
0.83 for the HEART score indicates a good to excellent ability to discrim-inate all cause chest pain patients at the emergency department for
their risk of MACE. Each element of the HEART score adds value signif-
icantly in statistical terms. The HEART score facilitates communication,
and it can be used as a guidance to correctly place patients into low, in-
termediate and high risk groups. In addition, it closely follows clinical
thinking. Less complex guidelines for clinical practice can be formulated
when advised policies are based on a HEART score strati ﬁcation.
Several risk scores for ACS have been published [16]. The most
reputable of these are the TIMI [8]and GRACE [9–11]scores. Both
were developed for risk strati ﬁcation of patients admitted to the cor-
onary care unit with an ACS, and may take observations at arbitrarily
chosen points in time into account. Although not designed for this
purpose, these scores are commonly applied and are recommended
in European and American guidelines
3at the emergency department
for the whole range of chest pain patients, both in practice and in sci-
ence [1,4,17,18] . Different from this, the HEART score was speci ﬁcally
designed for the much broader chest pain population at the emergen-cy department. HEART is based on admission data only, typically
complete within 1 h. This score is now validated in a prospective
manner.
Neither the TIMI nor the GRACE score appreciates the speci ﬁcity of
patient history (anamnesis), even though clinicians rely heavily on
this and guidelines advise to use patient history for making a diagno-
sis[3,14,19,20] . Some other scores, such as PURSUIT [21], FRISC [22]
and SRI [23]are less speci ﬁc and to some extent outdated, as troponin
levels are not part of it; therefore, these are not reported in this paper.
The GRACE score is a well-validated prediction model of death in
ACS patients. A practical disadvantage of the GRACE score is that it
can only be calculated by means of a computer. Although it was not
designed for making or excluding the ACS diagnosis in an unselected
chest pain population, we applied the GRACE score in the chest pain
setting at the emergency department. We found that the points
given for ‘age’accounted for 50.0+/ −18.3% of the total number of
GRACE points. Not surprisingly, higher age is related to higher mortal-ity rates. The predominantly age based GRACE score assesses the risk
of death of patients in the coronary care unit (CCU). Whether the
GRACE score helps the clinician to choose the right treatment option
in the ED is questionable.
The TIMI score, which was designed about 15 years ago for iden-
tifying high-risk ACS patients who bene ﬁt most from aggressiveanti-clotting agents, is relatively easy to calculate. However, it isquite rough as it allows only binary choices, thus ignoring the fact
that many variables have a ‘grey area. ’Than and co-investigators ap-
plied the TIMI score for the broad chest pain population at the cardiacemergency departments of 14 hospitals in 9 countries in the Asia-
Paciﬁc region [4]. In their prospective multi-center study 9.8% of the
patients had a TIMI score=0 assessed after 2 h and those patients
had a 4-week risk of MACE of 0.9%. In our study at 10 sites in the
Netherlands 36.4% of the patients had HEART scores 0 –3 within 1 h,
indicating a 6-week risk of MACE of 1.7%. Although the comparisonis hampered to some extent by differences in end point de ﬁnitions,
we believe that the approach in the Paci ﬁc study may bene ﬁt signi ﬁ-
cantly from the replacement of the TIMI score by the HEART score [24].
When comparing the GRACE, TIMI and HEART in terms of predic-
tive values for low- and high-risk, and the c-statistics, we conclude
that the HEART score is the best score for the group of all cause
chest pain patients at the emergency department and that GRACE
and TIMI should be reserved for ACS patients in the CCU.
As the purpose of the study was to validate the HEART score in
daily practice, the study protocol stipulated to use all measurements,
reference values and interpretations according to local standards. This
held true for the cut off values of troponin measurements. In practice
this resulted in differences in cut-off values for the same test in be-
tween participating sites in some cases. Consequently, some patients
with slightly elevated troponins may have received somewhat differ-
ent classi ﬁcations depending on the hospital where they were en-
rolled. However, this in ﬂuence is minimal and we considered it not
appropriate to make retrospective changes in the study protocol.
Other than in randomized trials, loss to follow up is an inevitable
reality
in an observational study at the emergency department: occa-
sional visitors occur and they are sometimes hard to track afterwards.Our clinical review of the characteristics showed that the 45 patients
lost to follow up (1.8% of the entire study population) were relatively
young visitors with low likelihood of disease.
The HEART score gives immediate direction to the treatment
policy. Over one third of our patients had HEART scores 0 –3, with a
risk of MACE of 1.7%. This observation may be a ﬁrm basis to omit re-
dundant diagnostic and treatment steps and move into the direction
of quick discharge. This issue was also addressed recently by Mahler
and coworkers [25]. In a retrospective study in low-risk chest pain pa-
tients from North Carolina (USA) they found a 0.6% risk of MACE in
904 patients with HEART scores ≤3. The authors state “…the
HEART score could substantially reduce cardiac testing in a popula-tion with low pretest probability of ACS ”. These conclusions were fur-
ther supported by their other recent article in this journal, whereHEART with 0 and 3 h serial troponin after presentation “identi ﬁed
20% (95% CI 18 –23%) for early discharge with 99% (95% CI 97 –100%)
sensitivity for ACS. The HEART score had a net reclassi ﬁcation improve-
ment of 10% (95% CI 8 –12%) versus unstructured assessment and 19%
(95% CI 17 –21%) versus the North American Chest Pain Rule ”[26,27] .
The group of high-risk patients (HEART scores 7 –10) in our study
concerns 17.5% of the entire study population. With a risk of MACE of
50.1% in these patients quick coronary intervention should be warranted
according to studies by others [16,28 –30]. Obviously, the early direction
given by the HEART score should not prevent the treating physiciansfrom further clinical thinking. In many patients the observation should
continue for some more hours, with repeated troponins and ECGs, in
order to con ﬁrm initial ﬁndings.
In conclusion, the HEART score for chest pain patients at the emer-
gency department provides the clinician with a quick and reliable pre-
dictor of outcome shortly after arrival of the patient, without
computer-required calculating. Low HEART scores (0 –3), occurring in
one third of the patients, exclude short-term MACE with >98% certain-ty. In these patients one might consider reserved policies. In patients
with high HEART scores (7 –10) the high risk of MACE may indicate
more aggressive policies.
Fig. 3. Probability of reaching a MACE related to the three risk scores. Only for the pur-
pose of comparing graphs we divided the TIMI and GRACE scores in deciles in order to
achieve the same distribution as the HEART score on the x-axis. All other computationswere made with the original values.2157 B.E. Backus et al. / International Journal of Cardiology 168 (2013) 2153 –2158
