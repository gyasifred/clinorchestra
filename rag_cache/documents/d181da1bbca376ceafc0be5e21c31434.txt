THROMBOEMBOLISM
www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 137 / 2 / FEBRUARY , 2010  263     Atrial ﬁ  brillation (AF) is the most common sus-
tained cardiac rhythm disorder, which is associ-
ated with a substantial risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke and thromboembolism (TE). A substan-tial evidence base is in favor of anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, eg, warfarin), which reduce this risk by two-thirds, whereas antiplatelet therapy decreases stroke risk only by 22%.  
1   VKAs are   Background:    Contemporary clinical risk stratiﬁ  cation schemata for predicting stroke and throm-
boembolism (TE) in patients with atrial ﬁ  brillation (AF) are largely derived from risk factors 
identiﬁ  ed from trial cohorts. Thus, many potential risk factors have not been included.   Methods:    We reﬁ  ned the 2006 Birmingham/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
(NICE) stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation schema into a risk factor-based approach by reclassifying and/or 
incorporating additional new risk factors where relevant. This schema was then compared with existing stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation schema in a real-world cohort of patients with AF (n  5  1,084) 
from the Euro Heart Survey for AF.   Results:    Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes compared. Patients 
classified as high risk ranged from 10.2% with the Framingham schema to 75.7% with the 
Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS 
2  (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age  .  75, 
Diabetes, prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema categorized the largest proportion 
(61.9%) into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the Birmingham 2009 schema classiﬁ  ed 15.1% 
into this category. The Birmingham 2009 schema classiﬁ  ed only 9.2% as low risk, whereas the 
Framingham scheme categorized 48.3% as low risk. Calculated C-statistics suggested modest predictive value of all schema for TE. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally better (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS 
2 . However, those classiﬁ  ed as low risk by the Birmingham 2009 
and NICE schema were truly low risk with no TE events recorded, whereas TE events occurred 
in 1.4% of low-risk CHADS 2  subjects. When expressed as a scoring system, the Birmingham 2009 
schema (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc acronym) showed an increase in TE rate with increasing scores ( P  value 
for trend 5 .003). 
  Conclusion:    Our novel, simple stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation schema, based on a risk factor approach, 
provides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS 2  schema, with low event 
rates in low-risk subjects and the classiﬁ  cation of only a small proportion of subjects into the 
 intermediate-risk category. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation 
in patients with AF.   CHEST 2010; 137(2):263–272

264 Original ResearchOther data on “real life” AF populations were provided 
in the ATRIA study,  9   but this study did not compare 
some contemporary risk stratiﬁ  cation schema as used 
in current guidelines.  10-12   
 Nonetheless, there are increasing data that other 
risk factors should be considered in reﬁ  ning stroke 
and TE risk stratiﬁ  cation for AF. For example, female 
gender increased TE risk in the Euro Heart Survey and other cohorts.  
13-15   Also, vascular diseases, includ-
ing myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, 
and complex aortic plaque, all increase TE risk in AF.  
16-20   Furthermore, stroke risk in AF increases at 
age  .  65 years onwards, and age as a risk factor is 
not a yes/no phenomenon. Indeed, the BAFTA trial 
showed that VKA was clearly superior thrombo-prophylaxis to aspirin in elderly (aged  /H11350  75 years) sub-
jects with AF in a primary care setting, which shows 
that the frequently reported fear of bleeding as an excuse for not prescribing warfarin to elderly patients is not justiﬁ  ed.  
1,2   
 In 2006, the Birmingham stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation 
schema was compared against the CHADS 2  (Conges-
tive heart failure, Hypertension, Age  .  75, Diabetes, 
prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema in a cohort of 994 patients with AF, and it was found that the accuracy of both clinical risk stratiﬁ  cation schemes 
was similar for predicting ischemic strokes and vas-cular events.  
8   The Birmingham schema was subse-
quently reﬁ  ned for the evidence-based UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on AF management, which formulated an algorithm-based approach to stroke risk stratiﬁ  ca-
tion.  
12   Since 2006, it is apparent that stroke risk strati-
ﬁ cation needs to be simple, yet consider new data on 
other risk factors (female gender, age, vascular disease, and so forth) that have emerged, and recognize that an artiﬁ  cial categorization into high-, intermedi ate-, 
and low-risk categories  per se  may be less helpful. 
Current treatment guidelines recommend VKA for high-risk subjects and (usually) aspirin for low-
risk subjects, but for intermediate risk, many guide-lines state “either warfarin or aspirin” can be used.  
10-12   
The latter can sometimes cause uncertainty for clini-cians managing such patients, especially if a large proportion of a particular cohort of patients with AF are classiﬁ  ed into this intermediate-risk category. This “either warfarin or aspirin” recommendation is also sometimes used as an excuse not to prescribe warfarin in intermediate-risk patients. Also, clinicians need reassurance that those classiﬁ  ed as low risk are truly low risk, with no TE events in such patients. 
 The objective of this analysis is to reﬁ  ne the 2006 
Birmingham/NICE stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation schema 
into a risk factor-based approach, by reclassifying 
and/or incorporating additional new risk factors as relevant. This novel schema (Birmingham 2009) was clearly superior to aspirin for stroke prevention, even in patients with AF aged  /H11350  75 years. For example, in 
the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) Study, the use of VKA (INR 2-3) reduced the primary end point of TE by 52% compared with aspirin 75 mg daily  , with no difference in major 
bleeding events between VKA or aspirin.  
2   Even in low-
risk subjects with AF, aspirin may be no better than control for reducing TE events, with a tendency to more adverse effects (especially bleeding) with aspirin.  
3   
 The risk of stroke and TE in AF is not homoge-
neous, and various clinical and echocardiographic features have been identiﬁ  ed to help stratify risk into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories.  
1   How-
ever, contemporary clinical risk stratiﬁ  cation schema 
for predicting stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or TE for patients with AF are largely derived from risk factors identiﬁ  ed from non-VKA arms of trial cohorts, and one cohort study (Framingham). Thus, many potential risk factors have not been adequately assessed, as not all potential risk factors have been systematically documented in the clinical trial popu-lations. The Stroke in AF Working Group  
4   performed 
a systematic review of these stroke risk factors and concluded that only four clinical features (prior stroke/TIA, advancing age, hypertension, and diabetes) were consistent independent risk factors. Also, existing stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation schema have widely varying proportions categorized into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk strata, and are generally of modest pre-dictive value in predicting stroke and TE (C-statistics of approximately 0.6).  
5   Again, some of the validation 
studies comparing the performance of different schema are limited by having been performed in anticoagulated trial cohorts,  
6   retrospective analyses 
of anticoagulated AF registries,  7   and in some, non-VKA 
arms of trial cohorts whereby antiplatelet therapy 
and/or subtherapeutic VKA (eg, INR  ,  1.5) were used.  8

 We reﬁ  ned the 2006 Birmingham (or NICE) TE risk schema 
into a risk factor-based approach, by deﬁ  ning deﬁ  nitive risk fac-
tors (previous stroke/TIA/TE and age  /H11350  75 years) and combina-
tion risk factors (heart failure/moderate-severe cardiac dysfunction, 
hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, female gender, and age 65-74 years). If we wished to artiﬁ  cially categorize these subjects, 
high risk was deﬁ  ned as one deﬁ  nitive or two or more combina-tion risk factors, intermediate risk was essentially deﬁ  ned as one combination risk factor, and low risk was deﬁ  ned as no risk factors being present. This reﬁ  ned (2009) Birmingham schema was also tested with a point-based scoring system, the CHA 
2 DS 2 -VASc 
score (see  Table 2   for deﬁ  nition), whereby scores of 0  5  low, 
1  5  intermediate, and  /H11350  2  5  high risk. 
 Deﬁ nitions of End Points and Risk Factors 
 Ischemic stroke was deﬁ  ned as a focal neurologic deﬁ  cit of sud-
den onset as diagnosed by a neurologist, lasting  .  24 h and caused 
by ischemia. TIA was deﬁ  ned as a focal neurologic deﬁ  cit of sud-den onset as diagnosed by a neurologist, lasting  ,  24 h. Peripheral 
embolism was deﬁ  ned as TE outside the brain, heart, eyes, and lungs. Pulmonary embolism was deﬁ  ned by the responsible physi-cian. TE as outcome variable of the validation analysis was deﬁ  ned 
as either an ischemic stroke, peripheral embolism, or pulmonary embolism. Deﬁ  nitions of risk factors, such as diabetes, hyperten-sion, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and so forth, are pro-vided in the online supplement. 
 Statistical Analysis 
 We used descriptive analyses with proportions and means 
( 6  SD) to describe the validation cohort, categorization of the 
three risk groups per schema, and the event rates per risk group. 
We calculated the 95% CI of event rates using the binomial approximation. We performed logistic regression with each schema, containing three risk groups, as independent variable and TE dur-ing 1 year as dependent variable. The probability that this model predicted the correct classiﬁ  cation of each patient (TE or not) was saved. Following this we plotted this probability in a receiver- operating characteristic (ROC) curve against TE as dependent variable. The area under the curve for this ROC curve represents the ability of a schema to correctly classify risk for TE, which is also referred to as the C-statistic (Harrell’s C). As a subsidiary analysis, we also ran the same analyses on 843 patients within this group who were not on anticoagulation at both baseline and 1-year follow-up. 
 To assess the effect of individual risk factors on the occurrence 
of TE in this cohort, we performed multivariable logistic regres-
sion with the following independent variables: age, gender, dia-betes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, prior stroke/TIA, prior other thromboembolism, and peripheral vascu-lar disease. To assess whether the effect of systolic blood pressure at baseline was different than that of hypertension, we performed the same analysis while replacing systolic blood pressure for hypertension and we report these results in the text only. Further, since recent echocardiography was not available for 400 (37%) patients, we repeated the initial analysis with the addition of left ventricular ejection fraction to assess its effect and whether other effects were changed by this addition. Variables were removed stepwise from the model when the  P  value exceeded .10. Vari-
ables with  P  value  ,  0.05 in the ﬁ  nal model were considered to be 
signiﬁ  cant contributors to TE prediction and we report the net 
odds ratio (OR), 95% CI, and  P  value for these variables. Vari-
ables in the ﬁ  nal model were tested for interaction(s), if any. then compared with existing schema in a real world 
AF patient cohort in the Euro Heart Survey for AF, where longitudinal data on outcomes have previously been published.

 Methods 
 Validation Cohort 
 To test the predictive ability of the reﬁ  ned Birmingham schema, 
and to compare this with the performance of other schema, we 
used the Euro Heart Survey on AF population. Survey methods, center participation, patient characteristics, management and deﬁ nitions of the baseline and follow-up survey of the Euro Heart 
Survey on AF have previously been described.  
21,22   In summary, 
5,333 ambulant and hospitalized patients with AF were enrolled from the cardiology practices of 182 hospitals among 35 countries in 2003 to 2004. Patients were enrolled if they were  /H11350  18 years old 
and if they had an ECG or Holter recording showing AF during the qualifying admission/consultation or in the preceding 12 months. A follow-up was performed to assess mortality and incidence of major adverse events during 1 year. 
 For the current analysis we selected 1,577 patients without 
mitral stenosis or previous heart valve surgery and who did not use either VKA or heparin at discharge of the qualifying visit. We had survival status during 1 year for 1,150 (73%) of these patients and the TE status for 1,084 (69%). Compared with patients with known survival status at follow-up, patients with unknown survival status were at baseline of similar age (66  6  15 vs 66  6  14 years; 
 P   5  .624), were as often female (45% vs 40%;  P   5  .103), and equally 
as often had diabetes (15% vs 17%;  P   5  .244) or a prior stroke/TIA 
(9% vs 8%;  P   5  .359), whereas they more often had heart failure 
(41% vs 24%;  P   ,  .001) and less often vascular disease (35% vs 
42%;  P   5  .015) and hypertension (62% vs 67%;  P   5  .032). Patients 
with known survival status at follow-up but unknown TE status 
were more often deceased compared with patients who had both survival and TE status known (24% vs 4%;  P   ,  .001). 
 Description of Stroke Risk Stratiﬁ  cation Schema 
 The various stroke risk schema compared and/or validated in 
this real world European cohort are summarized in  Table 1  . In 
case of multiple available schema, we chose to use the most recent one: for example, the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) 1999 schema (rather than the SPAF 1995 schema),  
23   the second 
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/ European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines (2006),  
11   and the eighth American College of Chest Physicians 
(ACCP) guidelines (2008).  10   We did use the AF Investigators 
1994 schema,  24   since the 1998 analysis explored the additional 
value of echocardiography parameters, but did not explicitly rec-ommend a new schema. The Framingham and CHADS 
2  schema 
are point-based scores, with the Framingham based on a mathe-matical equation  
25   and the CHADS 2  based on one point for CHAD 
and two points for stroke/TIA.  26   
 In order to compare their predictive ability with other schema 
for distinguishing low, intermediate, and high risk, we categorized 
the scores into three groups. We deﬁ  ned the CHADS 2  score in 
two ways: (1)  classic , whereby scores of 0  5  low, 1 to 2  5  interme-
diate,  .  2  5  high risk; or (2)  revised , whereby scores of 0  5  low, 
1  5  intermediate,  /H11350  2  5  high risk. We categorized the Framingham 
score in a similar manner to that proposed by Fang et al,  9   as fol-
lows: score 0 to 7  5  low, 8 to 15   5  intermediate, 16 to 31   5  high risk. 
In addition to these categorized deﬁ  nitions (commonly used in 
 © 2010 American College of Chest Physicians by Kimberly Henricks on February 9, 2010 chestjournal.chestpubs.org Downloaded from 
266 Original Researchfemale gender, history of vascular disease, prior 
stroke/TIA, and diabetes were associated with an increased incidence of TE (all  P   ,  .05;  Table 4  ). When 
assessing the independent effect of all potential risk factors on TE occurrence in multivariate analysis, female gender (OR 5 2.53 [1.08-5.92];  P  5 .029) was 
the only signiﬁ  cant associated factor, whereas the effect of vascular disease was near signiﬁ  cant (OR 5 2.27 
[0.94-5.46];  P  5 .064) ( Table 4 ). Taking into account 
systolic blood pressure at baseline, rather than the diagnosis of hypertension, showed that also systolic blood pressure was not signiﬁ  cantly associated with TE occurrence (OR 5 0.99 [0.97-1.01] per mm Hg 
increase;  P  5 .319). 
 The proportions of patients categorized as high, 
intermediate or low risk are shown in  Table 5  . Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes. Patients classiﬁ  ed as high risk ranged from 10.2% with the Framingham schema to 75.7% with the Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS 
2  
categorized the largest proportion (61.9%) of subjects 
into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the AF Investigators and Birmingham 2009 schema classi-ﬁ ed 12.2% and 15.1%, respectively, into this category.  Results 
 The 1,084 patients with nonvalvular AF, who were 
not on anticoagulation at baseline and for whom we knew TE status at 1 year, were on average 66 years old and 40.8% were women ( Table 3  ). Hypertension was the most prevalent stroke risk factor (67.3%), fol-lowed by coronary artery disease (38.4%). Antiplate-let drugs were taken by 74.0%.

 Discussion 
 In this article, we have provided a validation for 
a novel risk factor-based approach to stroke risk 
stratiﬁ  cation (Birmingham 2009), in comparison with 
other published schema, in a real world European cohort. This Birmingham 2009 schema considers patients with a prior stroke/TIA or patients  /H11350  75 years 
as high risk and as candidates for warfarin. Further-more, a combination of at least two risk factors from hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, age 65 to 75, female gender, and vascular disease are also considered to be high risk; we provide strong evidence from the Euro Heart Survey for the addition of the latter two risk factors. To aid risk scoring, we also provide a risk score for the Birmingham 2009 schema, using the CHA 
2 DS 2 -VASc acronym, with a clear increase in 
stroke risk with an increasing score, whereas those with a score of 0 to 1 (that is, low to moderate risk) had low event rates. We also conﬁ  rm the results of recent comparisons  
5-9,14   showing a modest predictive The Birmingham 2009 schema classiﬁ  ed only 9.2% as low risk, whereas the Framingham scheme categorized 48.3% as low risk. 
 The C-statistics all suggested modest predictive 
value of all schema for TE, with C-statistics ranging from 0.549 (SPAF) to 0.638 (Framingham), whereby the Framingham schema was the only one to predict TE better than chance in this cohort. If Framingham and CHADS 
2  scores were tested as continuous vari-
ables a slightly improved C-statistic was obtained compared with their respective categorized scores. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally bet-ter (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS 
2 , whether classic 
(0.561) or revised (0.586), or as a continuous variable (0.602) ( Table 5 ).  Table 3— Clinical Characteristics of 1,084 Nonvalvular

a Theoretical TE rates without therapy: corrected for the % of patients receiving aspirin within each group, assuming that aspirin provides a 22% 
reduction in TE risk, based on Hart et al.  28

lished schema with its revised (0, 1,  .  1) form.  9,26   As 
our analysis (and that of others  5-9  ) has shown, the clas-
sic CHADS 2  version generated a large intermediate 
risk group (  .  60%) for whom it is unclear which 
treatment (warfarin or aspirin) to apply. The revised 
CHADS 2  provided some improvement, with a low 
proportion classiﬁ  ed as intermediate risk, but with 
the addition of vascular disease, female gender, or age 65 to 74 years to a risk factor-based schema (Birmingham 2009) there was further reﬁ  nement 
of TE risk stratiﬁ  cation for AF with an improved C-statistic. 
 Current guidelines divide subjects into high-, 
intermediate-, and low-risk strata, but one advantage of 
a risk factor-based approach as proposed in the cur-rent analysis is the possibility to state “consider anti-coagulation if AF present with one or more TE risk factors.” Indeed, the presence of one deﬁ  nitive factor 
merits oral anticoagulation with (for example) an oral VKA (to a target INR 2-3). Patients with two or more combination risk factors should all be considered for oral anticoagulation. Thus, those with one deﬁ  nitive 
factor or two or more combination risk factors repre-sent the old-style high-risk category. The small group of patients with one combination risk factor (15% of this cohort) would represent the old-style intermediate-risk category and should be managed with antithrom-botic therapy, either as oral anticoagulation therapy (eg, VKA, target INR 2-3) or as aspirin 75 to 325 mg daily  , although the recent ACCP guidelines suggest considering a VKA rather than aspirin if possible.  
10   In 
 Figure 1  , we propose a clinical ﬂ  owchart, based on the Birmingham 2009 schema. Our reﬁ  ned schema 
can thus be presented in three ways: (1) in a narrative 
manner (high risk is one deﬁ  nitive risk factor, or two 
or more combination risk factors), (2) scoring system (CHA 
2 DS 2 -VASc score  /H11350   2 is high risk), or (3) as a 
algorithm-based ﬂ  ow diagram. 
 Where possible, patients at intermediate risk should 
be considered for oral anticoagulation rather than 
 aspirin, since undertreatment is more harmful than 
overtreatment.  28,29   Full discussion with the patient 
with one combination risk factor would enable agree-ment to use oral anticoagulation instead of aspirin to allow greater protection against ischemic stroke, especially if these patients value stroke prevention much more than the (theoretical) lower risk of hem-orrhage with aspirin and the inconvenience of anti-coagulation monitoring.  
10   As mentioned, the BAFTA 
trial found no difference in major bleeding between 
warfarin (INR 2-3) and aspirin 75 mg   in an elderly AF population in primary care,  
2   and aspirin cannot 
be regarded as a much safer alternative to VKA. 
 Patients with no risk factors are at low risk (essen-
tially patients aged  ,  65 years with lone AF, with are more likely to suffer a TE event or ischemic stroke when not taking warfarin, but when they are pre-scribed warfarin they have comparable INR control, are not more likely to suffer a major bleed, and dem-onstrate a greater TE risk reduction.  
15   The impact of 
vascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, on increasing TE risk in AF has also been systemati-cally reviewed.  
16-19   Furthermore, the presence of AF 
in association with peripheral artery disease is associ-
ated with a substantial mortality and morbidity, and the impact of atherothrombotic disease is also clearly illustrated by the presence of complex aortic plaque on the descending aorta being an independent pre-dictor for stroke and TE in AF.  
17,20   Last, stroke inci-
dence increases with advancing age, and in AF this is no exception. Given that age is not a yes/no effect on stroke, and that anticoagulation has marked beneﬁ  t 
in elderly subjects  
2   our proposal is that age  /H11350  75 years 
is a deﬁ  nitive (high) risk factor, and age 65 to 74 plus one additional combination risk factor also merits anticoagulation, thus improving thromboprophylaxis for large absolute numbers of AF patients who would otherwise be at risk. Our proposal is supported by data that the relative ischemic stroke risk re duction of antiplatelet drugs decreases with aging, 
whereas oral anticoagulation maintains its preventive power.  
27   
 The Framingham schema  25   had the highest 
C-statistic (0.638) but is based on a complicated math-ematical formula and has not been incorporated into current treatment guidelines. In addition, it classiﬁ  ed 
most patients of our cohort into low and moderate risk categories. Thus, many patients could have been denied VKA treatment on this basis, exposing them to the risk of stroke and TE. The AF Investigators schema  
24   is based on the original (and now, historical) 
placebo-controlled trials of warfarin vs control, and again, represents historical interest given that many schema (eg, Birmingham/NICE and CHADS 
2 ) have 
since evolved from this schema. Similarly, the SPAF risk stratiﬁ  cation schema is of historical interest and the CHADS 
2  schema was an amalgamation of the 
AF Investigators and SPAF schema, but the SPAF schema was the only one to have previously included female gender as a risk factor.  
23   Since publication of 
the Stroke in AF Working Group analysis,  5   the eighth 
ACCP guidelines have been published,  10   and the cur-
rent analysis provides a comparison of this against other schema. Because the eighth ACCP schema is broadly similar to the revised CHADS 
2  schema (score 1 
as intermediate risk group), it is unsurprising that the performance of this schema is comparable to CHADS 
2 . 
 The CHADS 2  schema is widely used due to its 
simplicity and ease. The CHADS 2  schema has been 
validated in its classic form, and we are unaware of a

within the therapeutic target INR range, which is associated with an increase TE risk.  
34   Implementation 
of methods shown to improve quality of VKA man-agement, such as an anticoagulation clinic, and the development of new oral anticoagulants that can be given as a ﬁ  xed dose with few food/drug interactions and no requirement for monitoring, provide an opportunity for guidelines to adopt this risk factor-based approach 
to simply state “consider oral anticoagulation if AF is present with one or more TE risk factors” (ie, CHA 
2  
DS 2  -VASc score of 1 or more). The Birmingham 2009 
schema also allows identification of a truly low-risk population, in whom no TE events were recorded in the low-risk subjects classified as no risk factors (ie, CHA 
2  DS 2  -VASc score  5  0) and such patients 
may not need any antithrombotic therapy. 
 This analysis is limited by its dependence upon a 
survey database, and although we have made efforts to ensure accurate coding and validation, all possible sources of bias and recording errors cannot be ex-cluded. An important limitation is the absence of information on TE occurrence during 1 year for 31% of patients from the baseline survey. Also, we have based our primary analysis on 1,084 subjects who none of the risk factors, whether high, moderate, or less validated), as conﬁ  rmed by the absence of TE events in this group in our analysis, and can be managed with aspirin 75 to 325 mg daily or   no anti-
thrombotic therapy, given the limited data on the beneﬁ  ts of aspirin in this patient group (that is, lone 
AF) and the potential for adverse effects.  
3   Indeed, 
the 22% reduction in stroke risk with antiplatelet therapy in the latest metaanalysis is largely driven by the SPAF-I clinical trial, in which internal incon-sistencies in TE events with the aspirin vs control arms are apparent.  
30   Also, it is likely that the magnitude of 
aspirin effect is related to the stroke prevention seen by giving antiplatelet therapy in patients with vascu-lar disease.  
1,27,31   It is notable that if trials with aspirin 
alone (and not other antiplatelet drugs) are considered in the recent metaanalysis by Hart et al,  
28   the 95% 
conﬁ dence intervals of the aspirin effect also include 
zero. Interestingly, more recent trials in vascular dis-
ease have not shown any signiﬁ  cant beneﬁ  t for aspi-
rin in the primary prevention of vascular disease.  32,33   
 Hesitance to prescribe VKA to patients at high or 
intermediate risk is substantially related to the need 
for monitoring VKA and the many interactions of food and drugs with VKAs. These limitations can   Figure  1. Proposed clinical ﬂ  owchart for the use of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial

However, conﬁ  ning our analysis to a secondary cohort of subjects who were not treated with anti-coagulation at baseline or during follow-up does not change our conclusions. Also, these analyses may have included some patients who were not started on VKA because of comorbidities, poor compliance (or inabil-ity to have adequate monitoring), and/or intolerance of anticoagulation, and furthermore, the numbers of end points in this subset are much lower. We recognize our modest follow-up period (1 year) in a contemporary real life clinical practice survey, but follow-up dura-tions in other analyses are only marginally better. For example, the (older) CHADS 
2  validation exercise only 
had an average of 1.25 years of follow-up.  26   
 In conclusion, our novel, simple stroke risk stratiﬁ  -
cation schema, based on a risk factor approach, pro-
vides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS 
2  schema, with low event rates in 
low risk subjects and the classiﬁ  cation of only a small proportion of subjects into the intermediate risk cat-egory. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratiﬁ  cation in patients with AF. Ongoing validations of the Birmingham 2009 risk schema in other AF populations from different race/ethnic groups will conﬁ  rm its true value.
