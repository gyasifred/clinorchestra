ABSTRACT
Purpose
To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on
outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer.
Methods
ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant
studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel.
Results
Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated sys-
tematic review.
Recommendation
Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient
management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association ofSupport Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined
within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the
previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses ofempirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for $4 hours before dis-
charge. An oral ﬂuoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is
recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless ﬂuoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before
fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-
spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient
treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Neutropenia, a decrease in the absolute neutro-
phil count (ANC), occurs frequently in recipients
of chemotherapy.1Neutrophils are critical in
providing host defense against infection, partic-ularly bacterial and fungal infections. The risk ofinfection increases with the depth and duration ofneutropenia, with the greatest risk occurring inpatients who experience profound, prolongedneutropenia after chemotherapy, which is mostlikely to occur in the period prior to engraftmentduring hematopoietic cell transplantation andafter induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.
2
Fever can be an important indicator and is often the
only sign or symptom of infection, althoughclinicians should also be mindful that severely or
profoundly neutropenic patients may present with
suspected infection in an afebrile state or even maybe hypothermic. Prevention and appropriate man-agement of neutropenic fever syndromes (FN) isimportant because the rate of major complica-tions (eg, hypotension, acute renal, respiratory,heart failure) in the context of FN is approxi-mately 25% to 30%, and the mortality rateranges up to 11%.

severe sepsis or septic shock, hospital mortalityAuthor af ﬁliations and support information

m a yb ea sh i g ha s5 0 % .5In 2013, ASCO released a guideline on
antimicrobial prophylaxis for FN, as well as recommendations foridentifying patients with fever and neutropenia who may betreated as outpatients.
6The Infectious Diseases Society of America
(IDSA) “Clinical Practice Guideline for the Use of Antimicrobial
Agents in Neutropenic Patients with Cancer ”was released in
2011.7For outpatient identi ﬁcation, validated tools such as the
Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer (MASCC)score or Talcott ’s rules, as well as clinical judgment, were
recommended.
6,7This update includes new evidence on risk
stratiﬁcation of patients who are seemingly stable and at lower risk
for FN, a population that has been dif ﬁcult to assess accurately in
the past.3Antimicrobial prophylaxis recommendations are not
included in this guideline update; they will be updated ina forthcoming separate ASCO/IDSA guidance document. Thedecision to address these two topics in separate guidelines was
made to make the recommendations clearer and easier to use for
clinicians.
This guideline update is being carried out in partnership with
the IDSA. ASCO methodology relies on analysis of strength andquality of evidence; IDSA uses the Grading of RecommendationsAssessment Recommendations and Evaluation (GRADE) systemfor rating the quality of evidence and determining the strength ofthe recommendations. This guideline uses ASCO methodology andgrading system. A summary of the key recommendations contained
within this guideline can be found in the Bottom Line Box.
Guideline Questions
1. What is the recommended initial diagnostic approach for
patients with fever who are seeking emergency medical carewithin 6 weeks of receiving chemotherapy?
2. Which patients with FN are at low risk of medical compli-
cations and are, therefore, candidates for outpatientmanagement?
3. What psychosocial and logistic recommendations must be
met for patients to be eligible for outpatient management?
4. Should patients with FN who are appropriate candidates for
outpatient management receive their initial dose(s) of em-pirical antimicrobial(s) in the hospital or clinic and be ob-
served, or can they be discharged immediately after
evaluation?
5. What antimicrobials are recommended for outpatient em-
pirical therapy in patients with FN?
6. If low-risk outpatients with FN do not defervesce after 2 to
3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibioticregimen, should they be considered for hospitalization orcontinue to be treated on an outpatient basis?THE BOTTOM LINE

METHODS
Guideline Update Development Process
This systematic review –based guideline product was developed by an
Expert Panel with multidisciplinary expertise (Appendix Table A1 , online
only). A patient representative and an ASCO guidelines staff member with
health research methodology experience were also included. The Expert
Panel met via teleconference and/or webinar and corresponded throughe-mail. Based upon the consideration of the evidence, the authors were
asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical
review, and ﬁnalize the guideline recommendations. Members of theExpert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penulti-
mate version of guideline, which was then submitted to the Journal of
Clinical Oncology (JCO) for editorial review and consideration for pub-
lication. All ASCO guidelines are ultimately reviewed and approved by theExpert Panel and the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee prior to
publication. In addition, the guideline was reviewed and approved by the
IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee and Board of Di-
rectors. All funding for the administration of the project was provided by
ASCO.
The recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with
multidisciplinary representation, including expertise in medical oncology,
hematology, infectious diseases, and nursing, and based on a systematicPART I

review of Medline conducted with the PubMed search engine (May 2011
through November 2016). Articles were selected for inclusion in the
systematic review if they were randomized trials and observational studiesrelated to outpatient identi ﬁcation and management. Tools designed to
identify potential candidates for outpatient management must have been
validated by published studies to be considered eligible for inclusion in theevidence base.
Neutropenia was de ﬁned by the Panel as an ANC ,1,000/ mL
(equivalent to ,1.0310
9/L), severe neutropenia as ANC ,500/mL
(equivalent to ,0.53109/L), and profound neutropenia as ,100/mL
(equivalent to ,0.13109/L). Fever in neutropenic patients is de ﬁned as
a single oral temperature of $38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of $38.0°C
(100.4°F) sustained over 1 hour.7
Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1)
meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals;
(2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative
reviews; or (3) published in a non-English language.
The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using the
Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompa-
nying BRIDGE-Wiz software (Yale University, New Haven, CT).8In ad-
dition, a guideline implementability review is conducted. Based on theimplementability review, revisions were made to the draft to clarify rec-ommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength
of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each
recommendation. See the Methodology Supplement for more informationabout the ASCO grading system.
Detailed information about the methods used to develop this
guideline update is available in the Methodology Supplement at www.asco.
org/supportive-care-guidelines , including an overview (eg, panel com-
position, development process, and revision dates), literature search and
data extraction, the recommendation development process (GLIDES and
BRIDGE-Wiz), and quality assessment.
The ASCO Expert Panel and guidelines staff will work with co-chairs
to keep abreast of any substantive updates to the guideline. Based on formal
review of the emerging literature, ASCO will determine the need to update.
The Methodology Supplement (available at www.asco.org/supportive-

Clinical Question 1
What is the recommended initial diagnostic approach for patients
with fever who are seeking emergency medical care within 6 weeks ofreceiving chemotherapy?
Recommendation 1.1. In the absence of an alternative explanation,
clinicians should assume that fever in a patient with neutropenia fromcancer therapy is the result of an infection. The initial diagnostic approachshould maximize the chances of establishing clinical and microbiologic
diagnoses that may affect antibacterial choice and prognosis. A systematic
evaluation should include the following:
a. Complete history and physical examination to identify infectious foci
b. Complete blood count with leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin
and platelet count; serum electrolytes; serum creatinine, blood ureanitrogen, and serum lactate concentrations; and liver function tests,
including total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase
concentrations
c. At least two sets of blood cultures from different anatomic sites,
including a peripheral site as well as one line lumen of a central
venous catheter, if present, although the Expert Panel recognizes that
that some centers may modify this practice and use only peripheralcultures, given the potential for false-positive results with bloodcultures from the line lumen of a central venous catheter
d. Cultures from other sites, such as urine, lower respiratory tract, CSF,
stool, or wounds, as clinically indicated
e. Chest imaging study for patients with signs and/or symptoms of
lower respiratory tract infection
f. Patients with an in ﬂuenza-like illness (ie, sudden onset of a re-
spiratory illness characterized by fever and cough and at least one ofthe following: malaise, sore throat, coryza, arthralgias, or myalgias) in
the setting of seasonal community-acquired respiratory illnesses
should have a nasopharyngeal swab obtained for detection of in-ﬂuenza. In some settings, such as patients with such symptoms in the
setting of hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem-cell
transplantation (HSCT), strong consideration should be given to
obtaining expanded viral panels for detection of additional re-spiratory viruses (in ﬂuenza virus, parain ﬂuenza virus, adenovirus,
coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus,
enteroviruses, and rhinovirus).
(Type of recommendation: consensus based, bene ﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate)
g. Assessment should occur soon (ie, within 15 minutes) after triage for
patients presenting with FN within 6 weeks of receiving chemotherapy.

This assessment is intended to be a sensitive test with low speci ﬁcity,
emphasizing inclusivity rather than exclusivity.
h. The ﬁrst dose of empirical therapy should be administered within
1 hour after triage from initial presentation. In addition, the following
recommendations from the 2010 IDSA guidelines are endorsed:
Patients who are seen in clinic or the emergency department for
FN and whose degree of risk has not yet been determined to be
high or low within 1 hour should receive an initial intravenous
(IV) dose of therapy while undergoing evaluation.7
Monotherapy with an antipseudomonal b-lactam agent, such as
cefepime, a carbapenem (eg, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin),
or piperacillin-tazobactam, is recommended. Other antimicrobials
(eg, aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquinolones, vancomycin) may be
added to the initial regimen for management of complications (eg,
hypotension, pneumonia) or if antimicrobial resistance is sus-
pected or proven.7
Vancomycin (or other agents active against aerobic gram-positivecocci) is not recommended as a standard part of the initial an-
tibiotic regimen for fever and neutropenia. These agents should be
considered for speci ﬁc clinical indications, including suspected
catheter-related infection, skin or soft-tissue infection, pneumo-nia, or hemodynamic instability.
7
Modi ﬁcations to initial empirical therapy may be considered for
patients at risk for infection with the following antibiotic-resistantorganisms, particularly if the patient ’s condition is unstable or if
the patient has positive blood-culture results suspicious for re-
sistant bacteria: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-
spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) –producing gram-negative bacte-
ria, and carbapenemase-producing organisms, including Klebsiella
pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Risk factors include previous
infection or colonization with the organism and treatment ina hospital with high rates of endemicity.
7
sMRSA: Consider early addition of vancomycin, linezolid, or, inthe absence of evidence for pneumonia, daptomycin.
sVRE: Consider early addition of linezolid or daptomycin.
sESBLs: Consider early use of a carbapenem.
sKPCs: Consider early use of polymyxin-colistin or tigecycline,10
or a newer b-lactam with activity against resistant gram-
negative organisms as a less toxic and potentially more effec-
tive alternative.
(Type of recommendation: consensus-based, bene ﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong)
Literature review and analysis. The previous version of this guideline
indicated no studies had been found that compared different diagnosticprocedures for oncology patients with FN, thus the Panel issued a con-
sensus recommendation that a systematic evaluation should be conducted,
which would include the steps outlined in Recommendation 1.1.
The limitations of the rapidity and sensitivity of blood cultures have
generated interest in serum markers of in ﬂammation, such as C-reactive
protein, interleukins-6 and -8, and procalcitonin, as potential markers to
guide decisions about antimicrobial use. In the 2011 IDSA guideline,
7
current data at that time were not suf ﬁcient to recommend routine use of
these serum markers. For this update, a systematic review with meta-analysis that reported diagnostic accuracy estimates for the biomarkerprocalcitonin for the diagnosis of bacteremia was included.
11Bacteremia
was identi ﬁed as the primary outcome rather than sepsis syndrome, be-
cause the latter may be too sensitive and nonspeci ﬁc. In a subgroup analysis
of 320 immunocompromised/neutropenic patients, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.71 (0.70 to 0.80 is considered
a fair level of diagnostic accuracy for predicting bacteremia). Pooledsensitivity was 66% (95% CI, 54% to 76%) and pooled speci ﬁcity was 78%
(95% CI ,71% to 83%), with a high level of statistical heterogeneity ( I
2=
76%).11The studies scored highly on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
Accuracy Studies instrument, a validated tool designed to assess the qualityof diagnostic accuracy studies that are included in systematic reviews,12
although scores for individual studies or for the subset used in the analysis
of immunocompromised/neutropenic patients were not available. Anadditional study found that lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) had
a similar diagnostic accuracy to procalcitonin or IL-6 for the diagnosis of
infection.
13The update panel concluded that more research is needed
before options such as procalcitonin or LBP can be recommended aseffective tools to determine if antibiotics should be initiated.
Data on time to antibiotic administration are sparse, although two
relevant studies
14,15were found during preparation for this update. Perron
et al14found a signi ﬁcant association on multivariate analysis between time
to administration (TTA) and length of hospital stay, but not mortality or
ICU monitoring. Rosa et al15found a signi ﬁcant relationship between TTA
and 28-day mortality, and a signi ﬁcant difference in 28-day mortality with
aT T Ao f #30 minutes compared with 31 to 60 minutes for an inpatient
population (log-rank P= .0002).
The update panel also endorses the recommendation from the
previous version of the guideline6for prompt assessment by a physician
after initial presentation and administration of the ﬁrst dose of empirical
therapy within 1 hour of triage.
Clinical Question 2
Which patients with FN are at low risk of medical complications and
are, therefore, candidates for outpatient management?
Recommendation 2.1.
a. Clinical judgment should be used when selecting candidates
for outpatient management. Factors to consider when assessing
risk for medical complications in the setting of outpatient manage-
ment of FN are outlined in Table 1 . (Type of recommendation: consensus-
based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of
recommendation: moderate)
b. The MASCC index ( Table 2 ) or Talcott ’s rules ( Table 3 ) are rec-
ommended tools for identifying patients who may be candidates foroutpatient management. (Type of recommendation: evidence-based,beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: moderate)
Qualifying statements.
Patients with FN who are infected by ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant,
gram-negative pathogens that are also coresistant to b-lactams/
cephalosporins should be treated as inpatients with a carbapenem-based regimen that likely requires multiple doses per day.
Patients colonized with or suspected of having MRSA, VRE, or
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection should be considered as
candidates for inpatient management. Patients undergoing HSCT orinduction therapy for acute leukemia are unlikely to be appropriatecandidates for outpatient therapy.
Recommendation 2.2. The Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neu-
tropenia (CISNE; Table 4 ) may be used as an additional tool to determine
the risk of major complications among the group of patients with solidtumors who have undergone mild- to moderate-intensity chemotherapy
and who appear to be clinically stable, assuming close proximity to an
appropriate medical facility that can provide 24-hour access. (Type ofrecommendation: evidence-based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)
Literature review and analysis. The previous version of this guideline
6
included several studies on stratifying risk for medical complications in
adult oncology patients with FN from chemotherapy. The majority of these
studies were validations of the MASCC score, which classi ﬁes patients as at
low or high risk of medical complications and has been recommended asa method for identifying which patients are candidates for inpatient versusoutpatient management of FN. One additional MASCC score validation
study was found during preparation of this update that presented ﬁndings
were consistent with previous results (Data Supplement).
16
In addition to an assessment of the validity of the MASCC score, as
well as Talcott ’s rules, the previous version of this guideline6presented a list
of exclusion criteria used in studies of inpatient versus outpatient

management that were used to provide additional guidance on when
inpatient management would be advised even in the event of a “low risk ”
MASCC score. These criteria are endorsed for this updated version of the
guideline.
MASCC score and Talcott ’s rules have been found to misclassify some
patients as being at low risk; pooled analysis found that serious compli-
cations developed in #11% of patients classi ﬁed as low risk by MASCC
score$21 and in 7% of patients in Talcott ’s group 4. Furthermore, theMASCC score and Talcott ’sc l a s s i ﬁcation were derived and validated in het-
erogeneous samples; patient has solid tumors, acute leukemia, or had un-d e r g o n eb o n em a r r o wt r a n s p l a n t .
17This update of the guideline identi ﬁed
a more recently validated tool, the CISNE, for predicting major complications,
including the occurrence of hypotension; acute renal, respiratory or heartfailure; arrhythmia; major bleeding; de lirium; acute abdomen; disseminated
intravascular coagulation; and other events considered severe according to the
study protocol

who appear to be stable and who had been treated with mild- to moderate-
intensity chemotherapy. Patients with acute leukemia, bone marrow trans-
plant, and lymphomas treated with the rapies other than cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and predn i s o n ew e r en o ti n c l u d e di nt h es t u d y
population.
The CISNE tool was validated in a multicenter population of 1,133
patients with seemingly stable FN.3A quality assessment of the CISNE
validation study was conducted using the Quality in PrognosticStudies tool. According to this tool, the CISNE study appeared to be at
low risk of bias for all domains, although the original risk prediction
model was limited to clinical variabl es routinely available at the time of
ﬁrst assessment, and the model may not be generalizable to patients
with lymphoma, because they were not highly represented in the sample
(n = 22).
The net reclassi ﬁcation improvement of CISNE over MASCC was
32% in the overall validation sample. CISNE demonstrated better per-
formance characteristics than the MASCC index and Talcott ’s rules
(Table 5 ).
CISNE researchers also conducted an unplanned subgroup analysis
that demonstrated the homogeneity of the odds ratios across all subgroups
of cancer and infection type within their study population.
Clinical Question 3
What psychosocial and logistic conditions must be met for patients to
be eligible for outpatient management?
Recommendation 3.1. Patients with FN who are eligible for discharge
and outpatient management must also meet the following psychosocialand logistic requirements:
sResidence #1 hour or #30 miles (48 km) from clinic or hospital
sPatient ’s primary care physician or oncologist agrees to outpatient
management
sAble to comply with logistic requirements, including frequent clinicvisits
sFamily member or caregiver at home 24 h/d
sAccess to a telephone and transportation 24 h/d
sNo history of noncompliance with treatment protocolsThe following additional measures are recommended:
sFrequent evaluation for at least 3 days in clinic or at home
sDaily or frequent telephone contact to verify (by home thermometry)that fever resolves
sMonitoring of ANC and platelet count for myeloid reconstitution
sFrequent return visits to clinic
Patients should be evaluated for admission to the hospital if any of the
following occur: patients do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial,
empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen, fever recurrence aftera period of defervescence, new signs or symptoms of infection, use of
oral medications is no longer possible or tolerable, change in the
empirical regimen or an additional antimicrobial drug becomes nec-essary, or microbiologic tests identify species not susceptible to the initialregimen.
(Type of recommendation: consensus-based, bene ﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate)
Literature analysis and clinical interpretation. These recommenda-
tions were based on the expert opinion of the Expert Panel members and
on exclusion criteria used in studies of the safety and ef ﬁcacy of outpatient
therapy.
Clinical Question 4
Should patients with fever and neutropenia who are appropriate
candidates for outpatient management receive their initial dose(s) of
empirical antimicrobial(s) in the hospital or clinic and be observed, or canthey be discharged immediately after evaluation?
Recommendation 4.1. In patients with fever and neutropenia who are
appropriate candidates for outpatient management, the ﬁrst dose of
empirical therapy should be administered in the clinic, emergency de-partment, or hospital department after fever has been documented and
pretreatment blood samples drawn. (Type of recommendation: consensus-
based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of rec-
ommendation: moderate)
Qualifying statements.
a. Patients should be observed for $4 hours before discharge.
b. Patients with FN and a low risk of medical complications, in whom
fever is responding to inpatient IV empirical antibiotic treatment and
the patient remains clinically stable, are considered eligible for
transition to an outpatient regimen.
Literature review and analysis. No studies directly compared out-
comes of immediate versus delayed discharge or different observation
periods before discharge for outpatient empirical therapy for low-risk FN.
In all studies of inpatient versus outpatient management, the initial an-tibacterial doses were administered before patients were discharged. Onenew study comparing inpatient versus outpatient management included
administration of empirical antibiotics in hospital, as well as a waiting
period of 24 hours before early discharge (Data Supplement). The ﬁndings
of this study were consistent with a failure rate of 3% to 15% with theambulatory strategy.
18
Clinical interpretation. Given the lack of evidence for a waiting
period prior to discharge for low-risk patients, the Expert Panel en-dorses consensus-based recommendations from the previous version of
this guideline
6to administer the ﬁrst dose of empirical therapy in the
clinic, emergency department, or h ospital department to verify the
patient is stable and can tolerate the selected treatment regimen. Theupdate panel also endorses the recommendation from the previous
version of the guideline
6for observation of patients for $4h o u r s
before discharge.
Where some patients and clinicians have preferred to begin
empirical therapy with an IV regimen administered in the hospital,
even for a low-risk FN, results of randomized clinical trials have
demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of early discharge anda switch from IV to oral regimens 8, 24, or 48 hours after the initial IV
infusion if the fever is responding and the patient remains clinically
stable.

Clinical Question 5
What antimicrobials are recommended for outpatient empirical
therapy in patients with FN?
Recommendation 5.1. For patients with FN who are undergoing out-
patient antibiotic treatment, oral empirical therapy with a ﬂuoroquinolone (ie,
ciproﬂoxacin or levo ﬂoxacin) plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or plus clinda-
mycin for those with a penicillin allergy) is recommended. (Type of rec-ommendation: evidence and consensus-based, bene ﬁts outweigh harms;
Evidence quality: intermediate; Str ength of recommendation: moderate)
Qualifying statements:
The use of a ﬂuoroquinolone alone as initial empirical therapy for
outpatient management of FN is not recommended; however, somestudies have shown that monotherapy may be effective in low-risk
outpatients.
19,20
In the setting of a high prevalence of ESBL-producing gram-negative
bacilli or ﬂuoroquinolone resistance, hospital admission and initial
empirical antibacterial treatment with a carbapenem should be
considered.21Similarly, in a setting of high prevalence of other re-
sistant organisms such as MRSA and VRE and concern for speci ﬁc,
active infection with entities such as pneumonia-causing pathogens
or central line –associated bloodstream infection, hospital admission
and targeted therapy should be considered.Literature review and analysis. The previous version of this guideline
6
included 10 meta-analyses with the following main ﬁndings:
A similar level of safety and ef ﬁcacy with oral versus IV regimens as
initial empirical therapy;
No better survival or therapeutic success, yet increased toxicity from
adding an aminoglycoside to a broad-spectrum b-lactam active
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; and
No decrease in overall or infection-related mortality or fever duration
from adding a drug targeted against gram-positive bacteria to
ab-lactam with or without an aminoglycoside.
Although outpatient IV therapy is widely available, oral drugs are
more convenient, less costly, and preferred by many patients and
clinicians to treat low-risk FN in the outpatient setting.An update of the meta-analysis that examined empirical antibiotics
targeting gram-positive bacteria for the treatment of patients with cancer
who had FN included no new studies.22An update of the meta-analysis
that assessed adding an aminoglycoside to a broad-spectrum b-lactam
active against P. aeruginosa included three new studies but reaf ﬁrmed the
ﬁnding that adding an aminoglycoside is not bene ﬁcial.23
Clinical interpretation. The panel chose to recommend a ﬂuo-
roquinolone plus amoxicillin-clavulanate (with quali ﬁers) because the
largest and most convincing body of evidence for the safety and ef ﬁcacy of
oral, outpatient, empirical therapy for FN is from studies that used thiscombination. Based on the updated meta-analyses included in this review,the revised guideline con ﬁrms that routine empirical addition of targeted
antibiotics for treatment of gram-positive organisms does not improve
outcomes for patients with cancer and FN,
22and that adding an ami-
noglycoside to a broad-spectrum b-lactam active against P. aeruginosa is
not bene ﬁcial.23,24The recommendations of the previous version of the
guideline remain unchanged.6
Clinical Question 6
Should low-risk outpatients with FN who do not defervesce after 2 to
3 days of an initial empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen (ie,patients who are experiencing persistent neutropenic fever) be considered
for hospitalization or continue to be treated on an outpatient basis?
Recommendation 6.1. Low-risk outpatients with FN who do not
defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibioticregimen should be re-evaluated to detect and treat a new or progressing
anatomic site of infection and be co nsidered for hospitalization.
Patients should also be evaluated for admission to the hospital if any
of the following occur: fever recurrence after a period of defervescence,
new signs or symptoms of infection, use of oral medications is no longer
possible or tolerable, change in the empirical regimen or an additionalantimicrobial drug becomes necessary, blood cultures drawn on pre-sentation become positive, or microbiologic tests identify species not
susceptible to the initial regimen.
(Type of recommendation: consensus-based, bene ﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate)
Literature review and analysis. The update panel endorses this
consensus-based recommendation from the original guideline. A full evi-
dence review of alternative strategies to manage persistent neutropenic feverwas outside the scope of this guideline.
DISCUSSION
This updated guideline includes the latest evidence on outpatient
management of fever and neutropenia in adult patients undergoingtreatment of malignancy. Guidance is provided to assist cliniciansin identifying patients who may be candidates for outpatient man-agement of fever and neutropenia, based on clinical criteria and/orvalidated scoring systems. A newly validated tool is recommended asan option for this update of the guideline; the CISNE can be used inthe population of patients with FN who appear to be stable afterchemotherapy for treatment of solid tumors. The CISNE can improveclassiﬁcation of this low-risk group of patients, relative to tools that
have been previously endorsed.
With the addition of few new studies to the evidence base,
the update Expert Panel continued to endorse previous rec-ommendations related to the treatment of patients with feverand neutropenia, including timing and type of antibiotic ad-ministration, and other related recommendations. Limited newdata continue to support administration of antibiotics as soonas possible; the Expert Panel has continued to endorse a strongTable 4. The Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia

recommendation to administer antibiotics within 1 hour of
presentation with fever. Additionally, a new meta-analysis ofdata regarding the serum biomarker of infection procalcitonindemonstrated that this biomarker had a fair level of diagnosticaccuracy; however, the Expert Panel concluded that more re-search would be needed before serum biomarkers can be usedas diagnostic tools to help determine if antibiotics are in-
dicated. ASCO will continue to monitor the literature for new
information and update this guid eline at regular intervals. This
update of the guideline focused on outpatient managementof fever and neutropenia, whereas the previous version ofthis guideline
6also included recommendations for antimicro-
bial prophylaxis. ASCO and IDSA plan to update the guidelineon antimicrobial prophylaxis in a separate, forthcomingpublication.
PATIENT AND CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION
Recommendations throughout this document are aimed at
a target audience of oncologists, infectious disease specialists,
emergency medicine physicians, nurses, and advanced practiceproviders. The patient representative included in our ExpertPanel highlighted the importance of communication betweenthese clinicians and inpatients and outpatients regarding edu-cation about safety practices, what patients need to be aware ofto communicate with clinicians, and expectations of patientand/or caregiver responsibility once the patient is discharged.Across the recommendations contained within this guideline,the patient representative highlighted that psychosocial andlogistic requirements for outpatient management should be
provided to patients and caregivers.
Furthermore, it is important to have speci ﬁc take-home
guidelines for patients and/or caregivers to follow in the eventthat fever has responded to the initial IV infusion and the patient isclinically stable for discharge. This could be in the form of a basicchart that could be used by clinicians and modi ﬁed, as necessary,
for individual patients.
Finally, patient input also identi ﬁed the importance of pro-
viding talking points to patients and their caregivers in the event ofa febrile patient ’s visit to the emergency department of clinic, so
that clinicians will be alerted immediately, avoiding potentially
long wait times for triage.
For additional information and strategies for patient and
clinician communication, please see ASCO ’s consensus guideline
regarding this topic.
25HEALTH DISPARITIES
Although ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert rec-ommendations on the best practices in disease management toprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that
many patients have limited access to medical care. Racial and
ethnic disparities in health care contribute signi ﬁcantly to this
problem in the United States. Patients with cancer who aremembers of racial or ethnic minorities suffer disproportionatelyfrom comorbidities, experience more substantial obstacles to re-ceiving care, are more likely to be uninsured, and are at greater riskof receiving care of poor quality than are others in the UnitedStates.
26-29Many other patients lack access to care because of their
geographic location and distance from appropriate treatment fa-cilities. Awareness of these disparities in access to care should beconsidered in the context of this clinical practice guideline, andhealth care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of
cancer care to these vulnerable populations.
MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS
Creating evidence-based recommendations to inform treatment of
patients with additional chronic conditions, a situation in whichthe patient may have two or more such conditions —referred to as
multiple chronic conditions (MCC) —is challenging. Patients with
MCC are a complex and heterogeneous population, making it
difﬁcult to account for all the possible permutations to develop
speciﬁc recommendations for care. In addition, the best available
evidence for treating index conditions, such as cancer, is often fromclinical trials whose study selection criteria may exclude thesepatients to avoid potential interaction effects or confounding ofresults associated with MCC. As a result, the reliability of outcomedata from these studies may be limited, thereby creating constraintsfor expert groups to make recommendations for care in thisheterogeneous patient population.
Many patients for whom guideline recommendations apply
present with MCC; therefore, any treatment plan needs to take into
account the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence ofMCC and highlight the importance of shared decision makingregarding guideline use and implementation. Therefore, in con-sideration of recommended care for the target index condition,clinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in thepatient and take those conditions into account when formulatingthe treatment and follow-up plan.Table 5.

In light of these considerations, practice guidelines should
provide information on how to apply the recommendations for
patients with MCC, perhaps as a qualifying statement for rec-
ommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recom-
mended care options are modi ﬁed or not applied, as determined by
best practice in consideration of any MCC.
COST IMPLICATIONS
The burden of a cancer diagnosis extends beyond the physical and
psychological effects of the disease, and the social and ﬁnancial effects
of cancer, cancer treatment, and supportive care on the patient and
family can be profound for patients worldwide.30The out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by patients for accessing care can range widely and
can affect patients ’ﬁnancial well-being signi ﬁcantly.31In particular,
patients with cancer who experience extreme ﬁnancial toxicity such
as bankruptcy, these ﬁnancial effects can be associated with increased
mortality.32Theﬁnancial consequences associated with diagnostic
and treatment choices for patients with cancer who have FN rarely are
associated with signi ﬁcant costs. However, the cost implications of
mismanagement of a patient with cancer who has FN and who
subsequently requires intensive care or prolonged hospital stays can
be substantial. While discussions about the costs of cancer supportive
care commonly focus on balancing the potential to save and extend
lives against the costs to society or payers, the low cost of most
interventions discussed in this guideline and their potential effect on
infectious complications suggest that they have a favorable cost-
beneﬁt ratio even without formal evaluations.
GUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION
ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health
settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase
awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line
practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to
provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. A re-
viewer of this guideline noted that implementation of some of
these recommendations, such the initiation of a health care pro-
vider assessment within 15 minutes of triage, will be dif ﬁcult given
insufﬁcient resources in busy emergency departments. The
guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate imple-
mentation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed
widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation
Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and
most often published in JCO and the Journal of Oncology Practice .ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
