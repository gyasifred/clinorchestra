DEFININGMNRSTOOLS
To begin, it is useful to define MNRS. A nutrition riskscreening tool is intended to be simple and performedupon admission to the hospital or, in some cases, uponadmissiontotheunit.Itisintendedtobecompletedbythepersonadmittingthechildandtoidentifychildreninneedofadditionalmalnutritionassessment.“Simplystated,thescreeningdeterminesrisk,theassessmentdeterminesthepresence or diagnosis of a nutrition related problem.”

MALNUTRITIONPREVALENCE
Diamanti and colleagues3looked at information on
disease-relatedmalnutrition(DRM)andrelatedoutcomes
in pediatric patients with chronic diseases in differenthealthcare settings and found that true prevalence infor-mationwasnotavailable.
The study population was screened for the presence
of malnutrition using body mass index (BMI) and/orheight/lengthforage z-scores<−2.Theauthorsfoundthe
prevalenceofmalnutritionwastwofoldhigher( P<.001)
forchildrenadmittedtoacutecare/inpatientpopulations(56.7%)thanforchildrenassessedatoutpatient(33.3%)andday-hospital(28.3%)clinics.

In the review by Carvalho-Salemi et al,4of the 2.1
million pediatric patients hospitalized annually between2002 and 2011, >54,600 had a coded diagnosis of mal-
nutrition (CDM), a national prevalence of 2.6%. Patientswith CDM experienced worse clinical outcomes, longerlengths of stay (LOSs), and increased costs of inpatientcare.TheoverallprevalenceofCDMincreasedfrom1.9%in 2002 to 3.7% in 2011, an 8% annual increase. Theauthors concluded that despite improvements, PMN will
remain underdiagnosed in inpatient settings if we con-
tinue to rely on codes based on the International Classi-
ficationofDiseases .Theauthorsstatethatthisonlyserves
to highlight the ongoing need for a national benchmark-ing system to determine the true prevalence of malnu-trition and its cost to children, families, and healthcareorganizations.
4
In a follow-up analysis by these authors, CDM preva-
lence increased more from 2011 to 2014 (3.6% to 4.81%)than during the previous 4 years (from 2.6% to 3.6%).Children with CDM continued with longer LOSs (11.2vs 6.4 days), higher costs per stay ($31,000 vs $16,746),andincreasedpatientmortalityrates(8.7vs3.9per1000)compared with children without CDM. The follow-upstudy also found fewer children coded with failure tothrive.

CURRENTMNRSANDASSESSMENT
TOOLS
In the literature, there are more publications and stud-
ies related to adult MNRS than there are related to pedi-atricMNRS.ThesystematicreviewdonebytheEvidenceAnalysis Library (EAL) for the Adult Malnutrition RiskScreening Project Group reviewed 3120 citations
6vs 1880
citations reviewed by the Pediatric Malnutrition RiskScreeningProjectGroup.
7Theevidencefortheadultswas
strong enough to enable the Academy of Nutrition andDietetics to publish a position paper recommending theuse of a specific MNRS tool, the Malnutrition ScreeningTool(MST).

ItwastheconclusionoftheEALsystematicreviewofthe

The group also concluded that although the validity
and reliability results of the Screening Tool for Assess-mentofMalnutritioninPediatrics(STAMP)wassupportedby grade I evidence, it used tool-specific charts that maybe difficult to integrate into the electronic health record(EHR). Therefore, it might be necessary to update thesevalidatedtoolstoinsertthemintotheEHR.Morestudiesareneededtovalidatescreeningtoolsinlargerpopulationsandinallagegroups,infantstoadolescents,particularlyinthoseyoungerthan2years,asthispopulationwasunder-representedinallstudies.

initial validation study was reported in 2010 by Hulst
et al.10It was designed for children 1 month to 18 years

The PNST is a validated malnutrition screening tool.
White et al used SGNA and anthropometric measuresto develop and validate the PNST. PNST consists of foursimple questions. The four questions include recentweight loss/poor weight gain, inadequate eating/feeding,and the appearance of underweight or overweight.The study to test and validate PNST included 295children.
12
Inthestudy,publishedin NutritioninClinicalPractice
in2016,PNSTidentified37.6%ofpatientsasbeingatriskfor malnutrition, whereas the pediatric SGNA (pSGNA)identified 34.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of thePNST compared with the pSGNA were 77.8% and 82.1%,respectively.
TheauthorsconcludedthatPNSTprovidedasensitive,
valid, and simple alternative to existing pediatric nutri-
tion screening tools such as STAMP, STRONGkids, and
PYMS, allowing for the detection of children at risk ofmalnutrition.
12
Inafollow-upstudy,Whiteetaldesignedandvalidated
a simple, quick, and universal weekly rescreening toolto identifychangesto the malnutrition statusof childrenduring their hospital stay.
15Of note, there is minimal
information on such tools in the literature for pediatricpopulations, although the need for rescreening andthe establishment of timeframes has frequently beenacknowledged.
16
Children ages 0–16 years with an inpatient LOS ≥7
days were included in the study. The Pediatric Nutri-tion Rescreening Tool (PNRT) included two questions:“Has the child had reduced nutritional intake over thepast 7 days?” (for identifying children with reduction inenergyintake)and“Hasthechildlostweightorhadpoorweight gain?” (for detecting poor growth). Indicators ofrisk included reduction in weight (in kilograms), BMI,energyintake(incaloriesperday),andproteinintake(ingramsperday)overa7-dayperiod.

Of the identified tools in the Evidence Analysis Cen-ter systematic review

use in the outpatient or specialty setting: ScreeningTool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics–Modified (Modified-STAMP), Nutrition Risk ScreeningTool for Children and Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis(NRST-CF), and Nutrition Screening Tool for ChildhoodCancer (SCAN).
7It was noted that there are limited
MNRS tools for use in the outpatient/ambulatory caresetting.
Primarycare/communitysetting
The Evidence Analysis Center systematic review7found
no pediatric MNRS tools in the community setting thatmet the criteria for moderate or high validity/reliability.The need for such tools and the availability of standard-izeddiagnosticcriteriawasrecentlyaddressedinanotherpublicationthathelpstoshedsomelightontheneedforfurtherstudyinthisarea.

The conclusion of the authors was thatpediatric undernutrition is a prevalent condition in the
community setting and that this impacts children across
differentdemographiccategories.

PMNASSESSMENTTOOLS
Malnutrition screening allows children “at risk” formalnutrition to be identified; however, none are specificenough to diagnose the presence or absence of malnutri-tion. A full dietetic assessment consists of several steps,including a detailed medical and diet history, a physicalexaminationthatincludesanthropometricandbodycom-position measurement, and laboratory data. The processislengthyandtime-consuming,makingitdifficulttousetoevaluateeverychildwhoisidentifiedasbeing“atrisk”ofmalnutritiononadmissiontothehospital.SGNAisanassessmenttoolthathasbeenvalidatedtoidentifythepres-ence and degree of malnutrition in pediatric patients.

theSGNAandWorldHealthOrganization(WHO)anthro-pometric measures have shown poor agreement betweenthetwomeasures.
29,34Thisisnotsurprising,considering
that the SGNA includes other factors beyond anthropo-metrics such as food intake, gastrointestinal symptoms,functional capacity, metabolic stress, and a nutrition-
focused physical exam (NFPE). The SGNA is a more
robustmeasurecomparedwithanthropometricsalonebutis not as detailed as a full assessment, making it a morepractical assessment tool for malnutrition identificationafter screening. Once the malnutrition presence is estab-lished, the RDN provides a detailed assessment, whereasthose without malnutrition would not require a fullassessment.
In general use, there is only a single validated mal-
nutrition assessment tool for pediatric patients: thepSGNA.In2019,asecondPMNassessmenttoolwascre-ated and validated for use in the inpatient/acute carepopulation.
29
In the publication by Wong-Vega et al,35the authors
created, tested, and validated a malnutrition screen-ing/assessmenttoolforusebynutritioncareprovidersinthe acute care setting. The study goals were to identifymalnutrition and risk among hospitalized patients, char-acterizemalnutritionriskfactors,andassessthereliabilityofcriteriaagainstoutcomemeasures.Thestudyincluded
children at 44 weeks’ postmenstrual age to 18 years who
were admitted for 48 h or more during a 16-day period(n=528).
This screening/assessmenttoolincludeddataonphys-
ical assessments, growth, energy intake, increased nutri-entloss(IL),alteredabsorptionofnutrients(AA),hyper-metabolism and inflammation, laboratory information,micronutrient deficiency, and functional status. The tooluserswerepediatricRDNs.
Theprevalenceofmalnutritionatadmissionwas19.7%.
Low weight for length/height z-score (WHZ) or BMI
for agez-score (BAZ) at admission was associated with
increasedhospitalLOS,increasedICULOS,andincreasednumberofventilationdays.Degreeofmalnutritionuponadmission,definedbyWHZorBAZ,hadnoeffectonLOS.Thosewithmorethantworiskfactorsassociatedwithmal-nutritionhadincreasedoddsforlongerLOS,irrespectiveofanthropometrics.
AA and IL upon admission were independently
associated with malnutrition. Wasting and hyperme-tabolism were independently associated with longer
LOS.
This was a study primarily addressing a population of
pediatricpatientsadmittedtoatertiarychildren’shospital,and thus, applicability to the outpatient/ambulatory care
settingmaybelimited.

In an additional study by Ong and colleagues,

authorsexaminedtheclassificationofmalnutrition.Usingthe SGNA and STAMP, the study criteria were comparedwith the reference standard, the criteria identified byASPENandtheAcademyofNutritionandDieteticsforthediagnosisofPMN(undernutrition).
STAMP was shown to have high sensitivity as com-
pared with ASPEN and the Academy objective measuresindetectingriskofmalnutritionamongchildren.
SGNA demonstrated its ability in identifying mal-
nourished children with good sensitivity (63.15%), and2 BeckerandBrunet-Wood 1098

SGNA had higher specificity (70.45%) than STAMP
(18.18%) when compared with malnutrition identifica-tion based on objective measurements as recommendedby the ASPEN/Academy Indicators of Malnutrition(AAIM).
43
The authors stated that the discrepancy in specificity
values between the two methods explained their respec-tive roles: SGNA as a nutrition assessment tool requires
moretimeandtechnicalskillstoevaluatetheNSofchil-
dren,resultinginahigheraccuracy(67.07%)indetectingmalnourished children, whereas STAMP as a nutritionscreening tool aims to screen, in a quick and simpleprocess, children who are at high risk of malnutrition.ThisstudyconfirmedthatSGNAandSTAMPshouldnotbeusedinterchangeablyinclinicalpractice.
This study used the STAMP tool to screen children
for malnutrition, the SGNA to assess children for mal-nutrition, and the AAIM to diagnose children withmalnutrition.
TheconclusionofthestudywasthatSGNAcanberec-
ommendedforevaluatingthepresenceofmalnutritioninhospitalized children in Malaysian tertiary hospital set-tingsbutthatSTAMPcouldnotberecommendedforuseasaroutinenutritionscreeningtoolinlocalMalaysianchil-drenbecausethereisahighchanceofmisclassificationoftheirNS.
The purpose of a screen is to cast a wide net and to
avoid a false negative response in which a malnourished
childwouldbemissed.Thefollow-upmalnutritionassess-
ment, either with the malnutrition assessment tool orbytrainednutritionprofessionals,wouldaccuratelydiag-nosethepresenceandseverityofmalnutrition.Thisisthebasic premise of the nutrition care process. As the finalstatement of the author’s conclusion asserts, “the use ofSTAMP will have to be followed up with a more validtoolsuchasSGNAtoverifytheactualNSofthepediatricpopulation.”

For the critical care pediatric population, Tume et al,45
intheirpublishedwork“PrioritiesforNutritionResearch
in Pediatric Critical Care,” looked at the current state ofpractice and identified the gaps to allow for recommen-dations for future best practice. The authors stated thatthe objective of the paper was to develop a list of nutri-tion research topics. The list included the impact of mal-nutritionincriticalillness,nutritionriskassessment,andtheassessmentofNSinchildrenwithcriticalillness.Thedefinitionandtheeffectsofmalnutritioninchildrenwhoare critically ill need further clarification.

MUAC
The pediatric MNRS systematic review also found thatMUAC, which is used around the world as a malnutri-tion screening tool, was underutilized in the US for thispurpose.

asimilarconclusionwasrevealedbythesurveyresults,46

at the time that reference ranges with standard devia-tionswerenotavailableforolderchildrenandadolescents,although percentile guidelines for ages 1–79 years wereavailable.
47Classification ofundernutritionusingMUAC
measureswassuggestedforchildrenbetweentheagesof6and60months.
16
In 2017, Abdel-Rahman et al published lambda-
mu-sigma values to permit the calculation of MUAC
z-scores in US children 2 months through 18 years of
age. This allowed for the application of the proposedindicators for older children in the use of MUAC as atool for screening and assessing malnutrition in this
population.
48
In the follow-up study, Stephens et al49examined the
relationship between MUAC z-score and the z-scores for

The results from 5004 children found that MUAC z-

The authors of a study on pediatric patients with

Inamulticenterprospectivestudyconductedamong623
children aged 1 month to 18 years in tertiary care hospi-tals, the prevalence of HAM was 24%. HAM was associ-ated with a higher rate of nosocomial infection (24% vs
11%) compared with patients without HAM. Risk factors
includedmoderatetoseveremedicalconditions,pneumo-nia, seizure, and surgery. Nutrition management showeda significant reduction in the incidence of HAM and atrend toward a 60% decrease in infectious complications
in patients with moderate to severe medical conditions.Approximatelyone-fourthofpediatricpatientsdevelopedmalnutritionduringhospitalization.
This study demonstrated that malnourished patients
with nutrition intervention experienced an improvementin their NS as well as a lower risk of developing hospitalmorbidity.Theauthorsconcludedthatnutritionscreening

Bridgingthegaps
The goal of this review has been to identify the gapsin PMN screening, malnutrition screening tools, malnu-trition assessment, and malnutrition assessment tools.Knowing the gaps helps to guide future practice. In the
systematic review by Klanjsek et al,
59the authors sug-
gest that one of the gaps is a need for a consistent ref-erence or a “gold” standard for the evaluation of screen-ingtools.Therecommendationforthestandardistheuseof weight, height/length, BMI/weight for length, MUAC,andpossiblymidarmmusclecircumference,assuggestedin the paper by Mehta et al on etiology-related malnutri-tiondefinitions.
60
Klanjsek et al also recommend that all studies to vali-
date MNRS tools use full follow-up nutrition assessmentfor positively identified screens and that the screen andassessmentbecompletedbyseparateindividuals.
