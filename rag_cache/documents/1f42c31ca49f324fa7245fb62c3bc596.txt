Abstract
Intravenous thrombolysis is the only approved systemic reperfusion treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke.These European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations to assist physicians in
their clinical decisions with regard to intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. These guidelines were
developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations,Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The working group identified relevant clinical ques-
tions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence,
and wrote recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided if not enough evidence was available toprovide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high quality evidence to recommend intravenous
thrombolysis with alteplase to improve functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h after
symptom onset. We also found high quality evidence to recommend intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patientswith acute ischaemic stroke on awakening from sleep, who were last seen well more than 4.5 h earlier, who have MRI
DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and for whom mechanical thrombectomy is not planned. These guidelines provide further
recommendations regarding patient subgroups, late time windows, imaging selection strategies, relative and absolutecontraindications to alteplase, and tenecteplase. Intravenous thrombolysis remains a cornerstone of acute stroke man-
agement. Appropriate patient selection and timely treatment are crucial. Further randomized controlled clinical trials
are needed to inform clinical decision-making with regard to tenecteplase and the use of intravenous thrombolysisbefore mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion.

In memory of Professor Eivind Berge
This guideline was co-chaired and led by Professor
Eivind Berge, Consultant Cardiologist at the
Department of Internal Medicine at Oslo University
Hospital. The ESO IVT guideline module workinggroup deeply felt the loss of his calm leadership,thoughtfulness, and thoroughness after his death.
Any mistakes or omissions are ours alone.
Introduction
Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase is the
only approved systemic reperfusion treatment forpatients with acute ischaemic stroke.
1The drive to
reduce times to IVT has led to more rapid treatment
for stroke patients in some areas of Europe. It hasblazed the trail for early stroke unit care, mechanicalthrombectomy, and reduced disability due to stroke
where this treatment is available. The widespread avail-
ability of IVT is a mark of success for researchers,stroke physicians and health care planners.
However, the use of IVT varies across Europe, and
demonstrates the ‘inverse care law’
2: in those areas of
Europe where disability due to stroke in the mid-years
of life is the highest, IVT use is amongst the lowest.
Those people who live in more rural areas, outsideUniversity centres with large hospitals and in countrieswith more modest incomes have less access to IVT, a
marker of access to acute stroke care.
3Another reason
for the low IVT treatment rates in acute ischaemicstroke patients may be related to the strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria of pivotal randomized-
controlled clinical trials.
A well-functioning health care system is needed to
provide rapid IVT to patients with acute stroke: emer-
gency dispatch centres, primary care, ambulance serv-
ices, emergency departments, radiologists, and stroketeams coordinated by a vascular neurologist or a stroke
physician. A stroke physician needs to ensure optimal
patient selection, and rapid decision making becauseIVT is more effective when given sooner after stroke.Therefore, we set out to provide guidelines on the
use of intravenous thrombolytics for stroke physicians
in Europe. We sought to update previous guidelines
from the European Stroke Organisation (ESO).
1
Since 2008, new randomised controlled clinical trials
(RCTs) have added to our knowledge. Here we
review and make recommendations from randomizedand observational studies that support a wider use ofIVT, particularly about patient selection in late time
windows and in patients with relative contraindication
to alteplase.
In this document, we outline the current state of the
evidence on the effect of IVT in different patient sub-groups and time windows, with different thrombolyticagents, and with different imaging selection strategies.
We hope to facilitate decision-making in patients where
there is uncertainty about eligibility for IVT.
Methods
This guideline was initiated by the ESO and preparedaccording to the ESO standard operating procedure,
4
which is based on the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE)
system.5The ESO Guideline Board and Executive
Committee reviewed the intellectual and financial dis-
closures of all module working group (MWG) mem-
bers (Supplemental Table 1) and approved thecomposition of the group, which was chaired byEivind Berge and William Whiteley up to January
2020. Following the sad death of Eivind Berge, the
MWG was chaired by Guillaume Turc and WilliamWhiteley.
The steps undertaken by the MWG are summarized
as follows:
1. A list of topics of clinical interest to Guidelines’
users was produced and agreed by all MWG mem-bers, avoiding: intra-arterial thrombolysis, mechan-ical thrombectomy, early secondary prophylactic
treatment after IVT, service provision or delivery
of treatment (e.g. thrombolysis in a spoke hospitalbefore transfer to stroke hub [‘drip and ship’], or
thrombolysis in a hub hospital with rapid access to
a thrombectomy suite [‘mothership’]), drugs otherthan alteplase and tenecteplase (e.g. desmoteplase,streptokinase, urokinase), stroke in children, and
stroke in pregnancy or in the peripartum period.
2. A list of relevant outcomes was produced and the
MWG used the Delphi method to score their impor-
tance (mean score from 10 respondents on a scalefrom 1 to 10):
Functional outcome including death (modified
Rankin Scale [mRS] scores 0–6): 8.3
Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH): 7.6II European Stroke Journal 6(1)
Death: 7.4
Quality of life: 6.2
Imaging-measured recanalisation: 5.9
Major extracranial bleeding: 5.7
Neurological outcome (e.g. NIHSS score): 5.5
Imaging-measured final infarct size: 4.7
Based on this vote, functional outcome was the out-
come of highest priority and was considered first, fol-lowed by sICH and death. Unless specified otherwise,‘excellent’ and ‘good’ outcome were defined as three-
month mRS scores of 0–1 and 0–2, respectively. Unless
specified otherwise, ‘better functional outcome’ corre-sponded to a reduction of at least one point in the mRSscore at three months. sICH was defined according to
each study’s original criteria. In case of limited data for
the outcomes of highest importance, outcomes of lesserimportance were also considered.
3. The MWG formulated a list of Population,
Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) ques-tions, which were reviewed and subsequentlyapproved by the ESO Guideline Board and
Executive Committee.
4. The main recommendations were based on a sys-
tematic review of RCTs of IVT versus control. Tothis aim, we have updated the results of a previously
published systematic review that was conducted up
to March 2012.
6We have applied the same search
strategy6for a period from March 2012 to May
2020. We have also included relevant literature pub-
lished afterwards in the final manuscript.
5. The authors independently screened the titles and
abstracts of the publications identified by the elec-tronic search and assessed the full text of potentially
relevant RCTs.
6. For each PICO question, a PICO group consisting
of two or three MWG members was formed.Whenever no RCT was available on a certain
topic, each PICO group conducted a literature
search to identify systematic reviews of non-randomized studies or key observational studies.
7. Whenever appropriate, random-effects meta-analy-
ses were conducted using Stata software version 11.0
(Statacorp). Results were summarized as odds ratios(ORs) or common odds ratio (cOR) and their 95%confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity acrossstudies was assessed using the I
2statistic.
Heterogeneity was classified as moderate (I2/C21
30%), substantial (I2/C2150%), or considerable (I2
/C2175%).7
8. The results of data analysis were imported into the
GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool
(McMaster University, 2015; developed byEvidence Prime, Inc.). For each PICO questionand each outcome, the risk of bias was assessed
and quality of evidence was rated as high, moderate,low or very low based on the type of available evi-dence (randomized or observational studies) andconsiderations on inconsistency of results, indirect-ness of evidence, imprecision of results, and risk ofbias.
5GRADE evidence profiles/summary of find-
ings tables were generated using GRADEPro.
9. Each PICO group addressed their respective PICO
question by writing up to three distinct paragraphs.First, a paragraph named ‘Analysis of current evi-dence’, in which the results of the dedicated RCTswere summarized and briefly discussed. Where noRCT was available, this paragraph described results
of systematic reviews of non-randomized studies. At
the end of the first paragraph, an evidence-basedrecommendation was provided, based on theGRADE methodology. The direction, the strengthand the formulation of the recommendation weredetermined according to the GRADE evidence pro-files and the ESO standard operating procedure.Second, an ‘Additional information’ paragraphcould be added to provide more details on random-ized trials mentioned in the first paragraph, to sum-marize results of observational studies, or to provideinformation on ongoing or future trials. Third,according to the first addendum to the ESO stan-dard operating procedure, an ‘Expert consensusstatement’ paragraph was added whenever thePICO group considered that insufficient evidencewas available to provide evidence-based recommen-dations for situations in which practical guidance isneeded for the everyday clinical practice. In thatparticular case, a pragmatic suggestion was provid-ed, with the results of the votes of all MWG mem-bers on this proposal. Importantly, the suggestionsprovided in this paragraph should not be mistakenas evidence-based recommendations.
10. The Guideline document was subsequently reviewed
several times by all MWG members and modifieduntil a consensus was reached. Finally, theGuideline document was reviewed and approvedby external reviewers and members of the ESOGuideline Board and Executive Committee.
Results
1. Treatment within 4.5 h of onset
PICO 1.1: In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, does intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase lead tobetter functional outcome than no intravenous thrombolysis?
Analysis of current evidence. Two summaries provide
evidence for this question: a systematic review andmeta-analysis of study-level data from 10 RCTs byBerge et al. III
Wardlaw et al. (6887 patients)6and an individual par-
ticipant data meta-analysis from 9 RCTs by Emberson
et al. (6756 patients).8These reviews included patients
with a wide range of ages and stroke severities.
The study level meta-analysis demonstrated that
alteplase within six hours of stroke onset reduced the
risk of death or disability defined as a mRS score of
3–6 [odds ratio (OR) 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.93,
P¼0.0006, I2¼63%], and that the effect was greatest
within three hours (OR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53–0.87,
P¼0.002, I2¼0.0%).
The individual participant data meta-analysis was
consistent with these results. It showed that alteplase
significantly increased the odds of excellent outcome
(no or non-disabling symptoms, mRS score 0–1) at
three months (six months in the third International
Stroke Study [IST-3]9), with earlier treatment resulting
in greater proportional benefit (p for inter-
action ¼0.016). Alteplase significantly increased the
odds of an excellent outcome when given within
three hours (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.35–2.27, p<0.0001)
from 3 to 4.5 h (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05–1.51,
P¼0.0132, Figure 1), but not after 4.5 h (OR 1.15,
95% CI: 0.95–1.40, P¼0.15).
The overall quality of evidence was rated as high,
with no serious risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness,
or imprecision (Table 1).
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, we recommend intravenous thrombolysiswith alteplase.
Quality of evidence: High/H20003/H20003/H20003/H20003
Strength of recommendation: Strong ""Additional information. The study-level systematic
review showed that alteplase increased the odds ofsICH (OR 3.72, 95% CI: 2.98–4.64, P¼0.00001,
I
2¼28%) and of fatal intracranial haemorrhage
within 7–10 days (OR 4.18, 95% CI: 2.99–5.84,p<0.00001, I
2¼0.0%).6Although alteplase was asso-
ciated with an excess of early deaths, it had no cleareffect on death by the end of follow-up (OR 1.06, 95%CI: 0.94–1.20, P¼0.34, I
2¼38%).
The meta-analysis of individual patient data showed
that IVT with alteplase significantly increased the riskof sICH defined as parenchymal haemorrhage of type 2(OR 5.55, 95% CI: 4.01–7.70, p<0.0001) or fatal hae-
morrhage within seven days (OR 7.14, 95% CI: 3.98–
12.79, p<0.0001).
8The absolute excess risk of intra-
cranial haemorrhage increased with increasing strokeseverity, but the absolute risk of haemorrhage wasless than the benefit from treatment with alteplase atall levels of stroke severity: for the average patienttreated within 4.5 h the absolute increase in the propor-tion of patients with a mRS score of 0 or 1 (6.8%, 95%
CI: 4.0–9.5) exceeded the absolute increase in risk
of fatal intracranial haemorrhage (2.2%, 95% CI:1.5–3.0).
10
The meta-analysis of individual patient data showed
that the early excess case fatality caused by intracranial
haemorrhage did not translate into a significant excess
case fatality at 90 days in patients treated in the 0–4.5 htime window (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.94–1.24, P¼0.27,
Figure 2).
8With longer follow-up, there was no evi-
dence of reduced survival in alteplase-treated patientsat 18 months,
11and at 3 years there was a non-
significant risk difference in favour of alteplase (risk
difference 3.6%, 95% CI: –0.8 to 8.1%).12
It has been recently argued that the evidence sup-
porting the use of IVT 3–4.5 h after stroke is frail, and

The numbers and the ORs for the two time subgroups are from the individual patient data meta-analysis of nine RCTs byEmberson et al.IV European Stroke Journal 6(1)
that imbalance in baseline NIHSS score may have been
solely responsible for the positive results of theECASS-3 trial.
13However, the individual participant
data meta-analysis by Emberson et al. does provide
support for this time window, and did adjust forNIHSS score at baseline.

Although IVT is currently recommended prior to
mechanical thrombectomy,14there is a debate about
whether IVT is necessary for patients directly arriving
at stroke centre with thrombectomy capability. The
recently published Direct Intraarterial Thrombectomyin Order to Revascularize Acute Ischemic Stroke
Patients with Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in
Chinese Tertiary Hospitals Multicenter RandomizedClinical Trial (DIRECT-MT) suggested that directmechanical thrombectomy alone was non-inferior to
mechanical thrombectomy preceded by IVT with alte-
plase (0.9 mg/kg) administered within 4.5 h after symp-tom onset ( n¼656, adjusted cOR for better functional
outcome at three months 1.07, 95% CI: 0.81–1.40;
P¼0.04).
15However, the trial had a liberal non-
inferiority margin (20%); a long onset-to-IVT time
(median approximately 184 min); and very short delay
from start of IVT to groin puncture (median approxi-mately 29 min). In addition, alteplase was not reim-bursed in the setting of DIRECT MT, which may
have resulted in delaying the allowed time for consent-
ing the patient and in further delaying the door toneedle time (median 59 min). Moreover, 31 patients in
the bridging therapy (IVT plus mechanical thrombec-
tomy) group did not receive endovascular thrombec-tomy, while another 30 patients from the same group
did not receive any or the full-dose of alteplase.
16The
proportion of patients with successful reperfusion afterthrombectomy (eTICI /C212 b) was 79.4% vs. 84.5% (OR
0.70, 95% CI: 0.47–1.06) in the direct mechanical
thrombectomy and the bridging therapy groups,
respectively. sICH occurred in 4.3% and 6.1% ofpatients in the direct thrombectomy and bridging ther-
apy groups, respectively (OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.36–1.37).
Other trials comparing direct mechanical thrombec-tomy and bridging therapy in mothership patients
with large vessel occlusion are ongoing
(NCT03192332, NCT03494920, ISRCTN80619088).
Whether IVT is effective in patients with lacunar
stroke has been debated. In the subgroup of patients
with clinically defined lacunar infarct in the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(NINDS) tPA trial (13% of enrolled patients), the
OR for excellent outcome was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.00–
6.37; P¼0.047).
17In patients with clinically defined
lacunar infarct in IST-3 (11% of enrolled patients),
the adjusted OR for good functional outcome at
six months was 0.91 (0.48–1.72). However, there wasno evidence of heterogeneity of the effect of IVTTable 1. GRADE evidence profile for PICO 1.1.

across stroke clinical syndromes ( Pfor inter-
action ¼0.46).9In a post-hoc analysis of participants
with MRI-defined lacunar stroke from the Efficacy andSafety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-UpStroke (WAKE-UP) trial (21% of included patients),
the OR for excellent outcome was 1.68, 95% CI: 0.78–
3.69, without evidence of heterogeneity of the effect ofIVT in participants with lacunar stroke or other stroke
types ( Pfor interaction ¼0.94).
18
Vessel occlusion status was not available for the
majority of patients included in pivotal trials of IVT
vs. no IVT, in which the imaging modality of choicewas plain CT. In IST-3, there was a non-significant
trend toward a better effect of IVT in patients with
obstructed (cOR for better functional outcome 1.86;95% CI: 0.76–4.53) versus patent (OR, 0.72; 95% CI:
0.42–1.25) arteries ( Pfor interaction ¼0.075).
19
However, the number of patients without arterial
occlusion was modest ( n¼140). A study-level meta-
analysis suggested a significant interaction, but the
thrombolytic used in 3 of the 5 included RCTs was
desmoteplase rather than alteplase.19A post-hoc anal-
ysis of the WAKE-UP trial was presented at the ESO
Conference in 2019 but has not been published yet.20
Among patients who underwent time-of-flight magnet-
ic resonance angiography (96% of the whole cohort), a
total of 308 (63%) patients did not have visible arterial
occlusion after assessment by a core lab. There was noevidence of modification of the effect of alteplase by
the presence or absence of visible vessel occlusion (OR
for mRS 0–1 at three months: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.00–4.18and 1.58, 95% CI: 0.97–2.56, respectively; Pfor
interaction ¼0.56).
In summary, IVT increases the risk of intracranial
haemorrhage and early death, but for those treated
within 0–4.5 h there are no clear excess of deaths by90 days. Although there are ongoing discussions
about the use of IVT in acute stroke in particular cir-cumstances – before thrombectomy, in patients with
lacunar stroke, and in patients with no visible large
artery occlusion – there is currently no strong evidencethat it should be avoided.
2. Treatment between 4.5 and 9 h after known onset
without use of advanced imaging
PICO 2.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h
duration (known onset time) selected with plain CT, does
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase lead to better
functional outcome than no intravenous thrombolysis?
Analysis of current evidence. The great majority
(98.5%) of patients included in an individual partici-
pant meta-analysis of 9 RCTs were randomized afterbrain imaging with plain CT.
8In 6 RCTs, patient could
be randomized beyond 4.5 h and up to 6 h after symp-tom onset (1229 patients treated with alteplase vs. 1166receiving placebo).
9,21–25This individual participant
data meta-analysis showed no evidence of significantbenefit of alteplase compared to placebo after 4.5 h of
stroke onset or when last seen well (OR for excellent
outcome at 3–6 months: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95–1.40).
8
Qualitatively similar results were obtained for goodoutcome (mRS 0–2), and with an ordinal logisticregression model (cOR for better functional outcomebeyond 4.5 h: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.90–1.18).
26The time at
which the lower 95% CI for the estimated treatment
benefit (mRS 0–1) crossed 1.0 was estimated to be
5.1 h.8
In a study level meta-analysis, the 4.5 h threshold
was not examined specifically,6but there was no signif-
icant effect of alteplase in patients randomised more
than three hours after stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI:
Figure 2. Pooled hazard ratio for death at three months in patients treated with IVT vs. control in the 0–4.5 h time window.
The numbers and the HRs for the two time subgroups are from the individual patient data meta-analysis of nine RCTs byEmberson et al.VI European Stroke Journal 6(1)
0.85–1.09; 5 trials, 1449 participants, I2¼45%),
although this estimate was not statistically different
from patients randomised less than three hours after
stroke.
The increase in risk of fatal ICH or type 2 paren-
chymal hemorrhage with alteplase in comparison with
placebo was similar irrespective of treatment delay.8In
patients treated more than 4.5 h after stroke, the ORfor parenchymal haemorrhage type 2 with alteplase
was 6.89 (95% CI: 4.17–11.38), similar to what is
observed for patients treated within 4.5 h from symp-
tom onset (OR 5.58, 95% CI: 3.35–9.30).
27Using the
SITS-MOST definition of symptomatic intracranialhaemorrhage, the absolute excess risk of intracerebral
haemorrhage with alteplase was 3.1% within
three hours (95% CI: 1.7–5.2), 3.0% between 3 and4.5 h (95% CI: 1.6–5.0), and 3.6% (95% CI: 2.0–6.0)
beyond 4.5 h ( p-value for interaction 0.73).
10In
patients treated more than 4.5 h after stroke onset,
IVT with alteplase led to a non-significant higher
three-month mortality (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.99–1.50).8
Other studies have found that patient selection using
a prognostic score based on simple clinical variablesand plain CT alone cannot identify a patient popula-
tion for which alteplase given between 4.5 and 6 h of
stroke is safe or effective.
28
Because the evidence in this chapter is from a sub-
group of high-quality RCTs, we have downgraded thequality of evidence from high to moderate.
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h
duration (known onset time), and with no brain
imaging other than plain CT, we recommend nointravenous thrombolysis.
Quality of evidence: Moderate /H20003/H20003/H20003
Strength of recommendation: Strong ##
3. Treatment between 4.5 and 9 h after known onset
with the use of advanced imaging
PICO 3.1 In patients with ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h duration
(known onset time), and with CT or MRI core/perfusion
mismatch, does intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase lead
to better functional outcome than no intravenous thrombolysis?
Analysis of current evidence. Mismatch between non-
contrast CT and CT Perfusion (CTP), or betweendiffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MRI
(DWI and PWI) may quantify the penumbral cerebral
tissue and could identify patients who benefit of alte-
plase beyond 4.5 h. However, most RCTs of IVT in
later time windows allowed not only the inclusion ofpatients with known onset >4.5 h but also of patients
with wake-up stroke (unknown onset, time last seenwell>4.5 h).
29,30We decided to provide distinct recom-
mendations for these two different clinical situations,because the true stroke onset of patients awakening
from sleep may frequently be <4.5 h before
randomisation.
31,32This PICO question focuses on
patients with known stroke onset 4.5–9 h before
presentation.
The Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation
Trial (EPITHET) randomised 101 patients with ischae-
mic stroke with 3–6 h duration to alteplase or placebo.
MRI was performed in all patients, but the imagingresults were not used for patient selection. Overall, 85
patients (86%) had PWI-DWI mismatch, but the trial
did not demonstrate a clinical benefit of alteplase.
25A
pooled analysis of the EPITHET trial and an observa-tional study showed that, among patients with PWI-
DWI mismatch within 3–6 h of symptom onset (101
patients), those treated with alteplase (60 patients)had significantly smaller infarct growth and higher
reperfusion rate, but clinical outcomes were not differ-
ent between the two groups.
33
The fourth European Cooperative Acute Stroke
Study (ECASS-4) compared alteplase with placebo in
119 patients presenting between 4.5 and 9 h after strokeonset or after awakening with stroke, and used MRIcore/perfusion mismatch to select patients for treat-

<100 ml, absolute perfusion lesion volume /C2120 ml (at
Tmax>6 s) and mismatch ratio between perfusion and
core>1.2. This RCT stopped early when recruitment
dropped after publication of the positive thrombec-tomy trials. Of the 119 included patients, 37 (31%)
had known stroke duration of 4.5–9 h (median time
to treatment 6.9 h), and 82 (69%) had woken withstroke. There was no significant effect of alteplase onbetter functional outcome at three months (cOR 1.20,
95% CI: 0.63–2.27, P¼0.57). The treatment effect was
similar in the dichotomized mRS analysis for excellentoutcome (mRS 0–1) which showed a 6.4% absolute
difference in favour of alteplase that did not reach sta-
tistical significance ( P¼0.45). No analysis of the sub-
group of patients with known onset time has been
presented.
The Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in
Emergency Neurological Deficits (EXTEND) trial
compared alteplase with placebo in 225 patients pre-
senting between 4.5 and 9 h after stroke onset or afterawakening with stroke, using CT or MRI core/perfu-sion mismatch to select patients.
29Inclusion criteria
were infarct core volume /C2070 ml, absolute perfusion
lesion volume of >10 ml and mismatch ratio between
perfusion and core >1.2. Of the 225 included patients,
79 (35%) had stroke duration of 4.5–9 h, and 146
(65%) had woken with stroke. The study showed thatIVT with alteplase was associated with higherBerge et al. VII
proportion of patients with excellent outcome (mRS 0–
1 at three months: 35.4% alteplase vs. 29.5% placebo,
adjusted RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.01–2.06, P¼0.04), and
there was no evidence that the effect was different in
patients treated during different time intervals (4.5–6 h
or 6–9 h), or in patients with wake-up stroke. A sec-ondary pre-specified ordinal analysis did not show a
significant difference in functional outcome (cOR for
better functional outcome, 1.55, 95% CI: 0.96–2.49).
The risk of sICH was higher in the alteplase group
(adjusted RR 7.22, 95% CI: 0.97–53.5, P¼0.05).
Campbell et al.
34conducted an individual partici-
pant data meta-analysis of EPITHET,25ECASS-430
and EXTEND.29The main analysis was based on all
patients who met the inclusion criteria of the original
studies ( n¼414; 52% imaged with perfusion-diffusion
MRI, 48% with perfusion CT). IVT led to a higher rate
of excellent outcome (36% alteplase vs. 29% placebo,OR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.15–2.99, P¼0.01), higher rate of
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (5% vs. <1%;
OR 9.7, 95% CI: 1.23–76.55, P¼0.03) with no signif-
icant difference in mortality (14% vs. 9%; OR 1.55,
95% CI: 0.81–2.96, P¼0.19).
34However, 51% of
included patients had woken with stroke. There was
no evidence of a modification of the effect of alteplase
in an analysis across the 3 predefined time strata (4.5–6 h, 6–9 h, wake-up stroke; Pfor interaction ¼0.87). In
the subgroups of patients with known onset treated
between 4.5–6 h and 6–9 h, the ORs for excellent out-come (mRS score 0–1) were 2.19 (95% CI: 0.82–5.85)
and 2.27 (95% CI: 0.83–6.24), respectively. Similarresults were observed for good outcome and better
functional outcome (Figure 3).
The authors conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted
to the subgroup of 303 patients who met the mismatch
criteria of the EXTEND trial (see above). To this aim,
imaging data for individual patients were reprocessed
using an automated software. Alteplase remained
associated with excellent outcome (OR 2.06, 95% CI:
1.17–3.62). However, after exclusion of patients with
wake-up stroke, the associations between IVT and excel-
lent outcome, good outcome or better functional out-
come failed to reach statistical significance (Figure 4).
Of note, 62% of the patients analysed in the indi-
vidual participant data meta-analysis had large vessel
occlusion but no thrombectomy was performed except
for 1 protocol deviation procedure.
14,34Therefore, our
evidence-based recommendation only applies to
patients who will not undergo mechanical thrombec-
tomy; please see the expert consensus statement
below for patients eligible for both IVT and mechanical
thrombectomy.
Table 2 provides details regarding the assessment of
the quality of evidence, which was judged to be low.
Recommendation
For patients with ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h dura-
tion ( known onset time) and with CT or MRI core/
perfusion mismatch*, and for whom mechanicalthrombectomy is either not indicated or not
planned, we recommend intravenous thrombolysis
with alteplase.

control. This analysis comprises all patients enrolled in the EXTEND, ECASS 4 and EPITHET trials, stratified by time window (4.5–6 h

Additional information. A recent prospective obser-
vational single-centre study reported that, amongacute ischemic stroke patients presenting in the 0–9 h
window, only 1.3% were eligible for IVT according to
EXTEND neuroimaging and clinical eligibilitycriteria.
35
The concept of DWI-FLAIR-mismatch, i.e., pres-
ence of an acute ischaemic lesion on DWI in theabsence of a hyperintense lesion on FLAIR in the
same area, has not been evaluated in RCTs of IVT
for the selection of patients with known stroke dura-tion of >4.5 h. One small observational study suggestedsimilar functional outcomes in patients treated within
4.5 h and patients selected with the use of DWI-FLAIR
mismatch and treated between 4.5 and 6 h after stroke
onset.
36
There is no current RCT assessing whether IVT is
superior to no IVT in patients who undergo advanced
imaging and display no core/perfusion mismatch. In
the subgroup of patients who did not meet the
EXTEND mismatch criteria after reprocessing imaging
data with an automated software in the individual par-
ticipant data meta-analysis by Campbell et al. (see
above),34no significant difference was observed in the
proportions of patients who achieved excellent func-
tional outcome between the alteplase and placebo
groups (adjusted OR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.48–3.10,
P¼0.68), but there was no significant treatment by
mismatch status interaction ( P¼0.43). These results
should be interpreted with caution because those
patients were still considered to have a core/perfusion mismatch according to an alternative defini-
tion of penumbral mismatch (i.e., they were deemed to
meet the inclusion criteria of the RCT in which they
were enrolled). Furthermore, the above-mentioned
analysis also encompasses patients with wake-up
stroke.
Expert consensus statement
For patients with ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h dura-
tion (
known onset), and with no CT or MRI core/
perfusion mismatch, 9 of 9 group members suggest
against IVT with alteplase.

There is currently no randomized data to make a
recommendation for patients who are scheduled to
undergo mechanical thrombectomy and are also eligi-ble for IVT in the 4.5–9 h time window.
Expert consensus statement
For patients presenting directly to a thrombectomy
centre with ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h duration
(
known onset) with CT or MRI core/perfusion
mismatch and who are eligible for mechanical
thrombectomy, the group members could not
reach a consensus regarding whether intravenousthrombolysis should be used before mechanical
thrombectomy.
For patients presenting to a non-thrombectomy
centre with ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h duration
(
known onset) with CT or MRI core/perfusion
mismatch and who are eligible for mechanical
thrombectomy, 6 of 9 group members suggest
intravenous thrombolysis before mechanicalthrombectomy.
4. Stroke on awakening from sleep/unknown onset
PICO 4.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke on awakeningfrom sleep/unknown onset, does intravenous thrombolysis with
alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no intravenous
thrombolysis?
Analysis of current evidence. Up to one in five
strokes occur during sleep, but IVT is often withheld
in patients with new stroke symptom upon awakening
and who were last seen well more than 4.5 h earlier.
37,38
Our literature search identified five randomised-controlled trials of IVT with alteplase in patients with
wake-up stroke.
29,30,39–42
MRI: DWI/FLAIR mismatch
The WAKE-UP trial included 503 patients who wokeup with a new stroke and were last known to be well
more than 4.5 h earlier, and had an acute ischaemic
lesion on DWI but no marked parenchymal hyperin-
tensity on FLAIR (DWI-FLAIR mismatch).
39,43The
trial excluded patients for whom thrombectomy was
planned. Patients were randomised to alteplase
0.9 mg/kg or placebo, and the primary endpoint was
excellent outcome (mRS 0–1 at 90 days). The trial
was terminated prematurely owing to cessation of
funding after the enrolment of 503 of an anticipated
800 patients. Thirty-four percent of the patients had
an intracranial vessel occlusion. The adjusted OR for
excellent outcome with alteplase was 1.61 (95% CI:1.09–2.36, P¼0.02) and the cOR for better functional
outcome was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.17–2.23, P¼0.003).Table 2. GRADE evidence profile for PICO 3.1.

aSerious inconsistency and serious imprecision: when including all patients from EXTEND, ECASS 4 and EPITHET , IVT with alteplase was significantly a ssociated with excellent outcome (mRS 0–1 at
three months) compared with control, with a similar OR in the 4.5–6 h and the 6–9 h time windows (pooled OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.10–4.50, I2¼0%). However, when only considering those patients who
actually had an automated perfusion mismatch, the point estimates for the 4.5–6 h and the 6–9 h time windows varied (OR 6.71 and 1.14, respectively), al though there was no statistically significant
heterogeneity in these ORs ( Pfor heterogeneity ¼0.09, I2¼66%), which might be due to a modest number of events. The pooled OR did not reach statistical significance and the confidence interval was
wide (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 0.44–13.78, I2¼66%).X European Stroke Journal 6(1)
Alteplase was also associated with a non-significantly
increased risk of sICH (2.0% vs. 0.4%, P¼0.15) and a
non-significantly higher mortality at 90 days (4.1% vs.
1.2%, P¼0.07).
The Thrombolysis for Acute Wake-Up and Unclear-
Onset Strokes With Alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg (THAWS)
trial used the same criteria for patient selection as theWAKE-UP trial, and patients with DWI-FLAIR mis-match on MRI were randomised to low-dose alteplase
(0.6 mg/kg) or placebo.
44The trial was terminated early
following the positive results of WAKE-UP withrecruitment of 131 of the planned 300 patients, leading
to a low statistical power. This trial found no difference
in excellent outcome (mRS score 0–1) at three monthsbetween the alteplase and control groups (RR 0.97,
95% CI: 0.68–1.41, P¼0.89). There was also no differ-
ence for death (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.06–12.58,P>0.99). Only 1 patient in the alteplase group had
sICH versus 0 in the placebo group.
CT or MRI: core/perfusion mismatch
The EXTEND trial compared alteplase with placebo in
225 patients presenting between 4.5 and 9 h after stroke
onset (or between 3 and 9 h, depending on national
guidelines) or after awakening with stroke (if within9 h from the midpoint of sleep),
29using CT or MRI
core/perfusion mismatch to select patients. Inclusion
criteria were infarct core volume /C2070 ml, absolute per-
fusion lesion volume of >10 ml and mismatch ratio
between perfusion and core >1.2. After 225 of the
planned 310 patients had been enrolled, the study wasterminated because of a loss of equipoise after the pub-
lication of the WAKE-Up trial. The study found that
alteplase was associated with excellent outcome (mRS0–1 at 90 days: adjusted RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.01–2.06,
P¼0.04). Of note, the study would not have demon-
strated superiority of alteplase had the investigatorsused another method of analysis than adjustedPoisson regression and a primary endpoint of mRS
0–1. However, the statistical analysis plan was deter-
mined before database lock and the results are there-fore valid. Intervention and control groups were
generally well balanced, but alteplase-treated patients
were slightly older, and with more severe strokes asmeasured by both core volume and NIHSS score and
this may account for the lack of statistical significance
for primary and secondary clinical endpoints in theunadjusted analyses.
45The risk of sICH was higher in
the alteplase group (adjusted RR 7.22, 95% CI: 0.97–
53.5, P¼0.05). The treatment effect was not signifi-
cantly different across the three time strata (4.5–6 h;
6–9 h; wake-up stroke: Pfor interaction ¼0.41). A
total of 146 (65%) patients had woken with stroke.In the subgroup of patients with wake-up stroke, theadjusted RR for excellent outcome was 1.53 (95% CI:
0.97–2.43).
Individual participant data Meta-analysis
A systematic review and individual participant datameta-analysis of RCTs of IVT with alteplase forpatients with stroke of unknown time of onset guided
by advanced imaging was recently conducted by the
Evaluation of unknown Onset Stroke thrombolysistrials (EOS) investigators.
46A total of 843 patients
enrolled in studies based on DWI-FLAIR mismatch
(WAKE-UP39and THAWS44) or core/perfusion mis-
match (EXTEND29and ECASS-430) were included.
Perfusion data was automatically reprocessed using
the RAPID software, and the authors used the defini-
tion of penumbral mismatch from the EXTEND trialfor their analysis (infarct core volume /C2070 ml, absolute
perfusion lesion volume of >10 ml and mismatch ratio
between perfusion and core >1.2). The median time
between last seen well and treatment initiation was
10.5 h and the imaging modality was MRI in 85% of
cases. Compared to placebo or standard care, IVT wassignificantly associated with excellent outcome (prima-
ry endpoint: adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.10–2.03,
P¼0.01; I
2¼27%) and better functional outcome
(adjusted cOR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05–1.80, P¼0.02), at
the expense of a higher risk of sICH (3% vs. 0.5%,
P¼0.02) and mortality within three months (adjusted
OR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.03–4.09, P¼0.04). The effect of
alteplase was consistent across predefined subgroups,
including imaging modality (CT vs. MRI) and largevessel occlusion status. Of note, mechanical thrombec-
tomy was not performed in the 25% of included
patients with large vessel occlusion.
Albeit based on the EOS meta-analysis, our recom-
mendation for patients with MRI DWI-FLAIR
mismatch is mostly driven by the results of theWAKE-UP trial, which used a standard dose of alte-plase, unlike the small THAWS trial, in which the dose
of 0.6 mg/kg was used. Both studies were terminated
early. We rated the quality of the evidence as high(Table 3) because of the relatively large sample size,
the fact that the WAKE-UP study was specifically
focusing on patients with unknown symptom onsetand that the superiority of IVT was consistently
observed across secondary endpoints. For patients
with CT or MRI perfusion core/perfusion mismatchand unknown time of onset, we rated the quality of
evidence as moderate (Table 3) for several reasons.
First, no study based on perfusion mismatch was spe-cifically dedicated to patients with unknown time of
onset and therefore the evidence comes from subgroups
of patients in two relatively small RCTs that werestopped prematurely. Second, the positive associationBerge et al. XI

*In the EOS meta-analysis of 4 RCTs of IVT vs. placebo/usual care in patients ( n¼843) with unknown stroke onset and either DWI-FLAIR mismatch or core/perfusion mismatch,46the adjusted OR for mRS 0–1 at
three months was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.10–2.03 in favor of alteplase ( P¼0.01). In the subgroup of patients with DWI-FLAIR mismatch ( n¼641), the adjusted OR for mRS 0–1 was 1.45 (0.98–2.13). In the subgroup of patients with
core/perfusion mismatch ( n¼221), the OR for mRS 0–1 at three months was 2.14 (1.11–4.12).
aVery large confidence interval. Although IVTwith alteplase was not significantly associated with any definition of sICH, the point estimates where high (OR >4) for the ECASS 3 and SITS-MOST definitions, with very large
confidence intervals as well. Furthermore, IVT was significantly associated with Parenchymal Hemorrhage type 2.
bThese results are based on a reanalysis of individual patient imaging data, using the perfusion criteria of the EXTEND trial, which are slightly diffe rent from those of the ECASS 4 trial. Based on the perfusion mismatch
criteria of each original study, the association would not have been significant (OR 1.56; 0.81–3.02).34
cLarge confidence interval including 1.0.
between IVT and excellent outcome was only demon-
strated after a reanalysis of individual patient imagingdata using the perfusion criteria of the EXTEND
trial,
29which slightly differ from those of the ECASS
4 trial.30Based on the perfusion mismatch criteria of
each original study, the association would not havebeen significant (OR 1.56; 0.81–3.02).
34Of note, in
the EOS individual participant data meta-analysis,
only 54% ( n¼221) of patients with available assess-
ment for perfusion imaging had a penumbral mismatchaccording to the EXTEND criteria
46. However,
because this analysis showed a clear benefit of IVT
(adjusted OR for excellent outcome 2.14, 95% CI:
1.11–4.12), we provide a strong recommendation infavour of IVT in this situation.
There is currently no randomized data to make a
recommendation for wake-up stroke patients who are
scheduled to undergo mechanical thrombectomy andare also eligible for IVT; please see the expert consensusstatement below for this situation.

5. Tenecteplase
PICO 5.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, does IVT with tenecteplase lead to better functionaloutcome than IVT with alteplase?
Analysis of current evidence. Tenecteplase has phar-
macological advantages over alteplase. It has a higherfibrin affinity, longer half-life, and can be administeredwith a single intravenous bolus injection. We identified
3 RCTs comparing tenecteplase with alteplase in ‘unse-
lected’ patients with acute ischaemic stroke,
47–49which
are reviewed in the present section, and two trials com-paring tenecteplase with alteplase in selected patients
with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlu-
sion, which are discussed in the next section (PICO 5.2)in order to limit heterogeneity in meta-analyses.
50,51
In the Phase IIB/III Trial of Tenecteplase in Acute
Ischemic Stroke (TNK-S2B), 112 patients were rando-
mised within three hours of stroke onset to tenecteplase0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg. The first step of the trial aimed at finding the opti-
mal dose of tenecteplase using a composite outcome
measure, and the second step aimed at testing whetherthis dose was superior to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in improv-ing functional outcome at three months.
47The trial was
terminated prematurely because of slow recruitment.
The adaptive dose selection procedure suggested that
tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg was inferior to the two otherdoses due to an excess of sICH (incidence rate15.8%, 95% CI: 5.5–37.6%). The proportion of
patients with good functional outcome (mRS 0–2) at
three months did not differ between the treatmentarms, but the study was underpowered for this analysis.
In the Alteplase-Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for
Stroke Thrombolysis (ATTEST) trial, 104 patients
were randomised to tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or alte-plase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 h of stroke onset.
48The pri-
mary outcome measure was the percentage ofBerge et al. XIII
penumbra salvaged at 24–48 h, defined as CT
perfusion-defined penumbra volume at baseline minus
plain CT infarct volume at 24–48 h. Three-quarters of
patients had an arterial occlusion on CT angiography.
Mechanical thrombectomy was not performed. There
were no significant differences for the primary outcome
measure or for the secondary outcome measures ofmRS scores 0–1 at 90 days (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.3–3.5)
or sICH.
In the Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial (NOR-
TEST), 1100 patients were randomised to tenecteplase
0.4 mg/kg or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 h of strokeonset or awakening with stroke.
49The trial aimed to
show superiority for tenecteplase, and the primary out-
come measure was excellent outcome at three months
(mRS score 0–1). The included patients had mild strokes
(median NIHSS score 4) and 18% of the patients had astroke mimic. There was no difference in the proportion
of patients with excellent outcome (OR 1.08, 95% CI:0.84–1.38, P¼0.52), and there was no significant differ-
ence in the incidence of sICH.
We performed a meta-analysis of study-level data,
and found no significant difference between tenecte-plase and alteplase in the proportion of patients withexcellent (Figure 5) or good outcome at three months(data not shown), irrespective of the tenecteplase dose.There was no significant difference in the incidence ofsICH (Figure 6). A published meta-analysis also foundsimilar functional outcomes in the two treatmentgroups.

The quality of the evidence was deemed low (see
Table 4 for justification). None of the trials weredesigned to show non-inferiority of tenecteplase com-pared to alteplase.

aThe TNK-S2B trial was terminated prematurely – in the dose finding phase – because of slow recruitment. The following phase would have investigated th e superiority of T enecteplase over Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg.
bDifferences in populations
cDifferent definitions of sICH were used across studies.
dIn NOR-TEST , 18% of included patients had a stroke mimic and were distributed similarly between the T enecteplase and Alteplase arm.

Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration and not eligible for thrombectomy, we
suggest intravenous thrombolysis with alteplaseover intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase.

mechanical thrombectomy.Quality of evidence: Low/H20003/H20003

Additional information. A meta-analysis of 5 ran-
domized trials (TNK-S2B, Tenecteplase versusAlteplase for Acute Ischemic Stroke [TAAIS],ATTEST, NOR-TEST, Tenecteplase versus Alteplasebefore Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke[EXTEND-IA TNK]) suggested that there is enough
evidence to conclude that tenecteplase is non-inferior
to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke (risk differencefor mRS 0–1: 4%, 95% CI: –1% to 8%).
53However,
this result was mostly driven by the inclusion ofEXTEND-IA TNK and TAAIS in the meta-analysis,which enrolled only patients with large vessel occlusionas opposed to the other trials. Furthermore, the highproportion of stroke mimics in NOR-TEST could havebiased results towards non-inferiority. Of note, thenon-inferiority margin was selected using data from a
RCT comparing two doses of alteplase (0.9 mg/kg vs.
0.6 mg/kg).
54
There are ongoing trials of tenecteplase for acute
ischemic stroke (ATTEST-2 [NCT02814409],Tenecteplase versus Alteplase for Stroke Thrombolysis
Evaluation (TASTE; ACTRN12613000243718),
A Randomized Controlled Trial of TNK-tPA VersusStandard of Care for Minor Ischemic Stroke WithProven Occlusion (TEMPO-2; NCT02398656). Weencourage enrolment into ongoing trials.
PICO 5.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration and with large vessel occlusion, who are candidatesfor mechanical thrombectomy, and for whom intravenousthrombolysis is considered before thrombectomy, does IVTwith tenecteplase lead to better functional outcome than IVTwith alteplase?
Analysis of current evidence. In the TAAIS trial, 75
patients were randomised to tenecteplase 0.1 mg/kg or0.25 mg/kg or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 6 h of strokeonset.
50Patient selection was based on the finding of
occlusion of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral
artery on CT angiography and a CT perfusion lesionvolume that was at least 20 ml and at least 20% greaterthan the infarct core on CT perfusion. Mechanicalthrombectomy was not performed. The two
co-primary outcome measures were the percentage ofthe perfusion lesion that was reperfused at 24 h after
treatment (as assessed by perfusion MRI) and the
change on the NIHSS score between baseline and24 h. Tenecteplase was superior to alteplase for both
co-primary outcome measures. At three months, good
outcome (mRS 0–2) was observed in 72% of patients inthe pooled tenecteplase groups vs. 44% in the alteplase
group ( P¼0.02). The rate of symptomatic intracerebral
haemorrhage did not differ significantly between thegroups. In the dose-tier analysis, tenecteplase0.25 mg/kg was associated with clinical improvement
during the first 24 h and a non-significant increase in
the proportion of patients with good outcome atthree months ( P¼0.11). The frequency of sICH was
similar in the two tenecteplase groups (4%).
The EXTEND-IA TNK trial compared tenecteplase
0.25 mg/kg with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 h of
symptom onset in 202 patients with large vessel occlu-
sion (internal carotid artery, first and second segmentsof the middle cerebral artery, or the basilar artery) who
were candidates for mechanical thrombectomy.
51The
trial was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority, butafter testing for non-inferiority, superiority testing wasperformed as pre-specified. The primary outcome mea-
sure was reperfusion greater than 50% of the involved
ischaemic territory or absence of retrievable thrombusat the time of the initial angiographic assessment, and
was found in 22% of the patients treated with tenecte-
plase versus 10% of those treated with alteplase ( pfor
non-inferiority ¼0.002; pfor superiority ¼0.03).
Tenecteplase was borderline associated with better 90-
day functional outcome than alteplase (cOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.0–2.8, P¼0.04 – adjusted on age and baseline
NIHSS score). There were no significant differences
in the proportions of patients with good ( P¼0.06),
excellent outcome ( P¼0.23) or early neurological
improvement ( P¼0.70). Symptomatic intracerebral
haemorrhage occurred in 1% of the patients in each
group.
A meta-analysis of patients with large vessel occlu-
sion in EXTEND-IA TNK and TAAIS showed that
tenecteplase was associated with a higher likelihoodof complete recanalisation (OR 2.01, 95% CI: 1.04–3.87, P¼0.04).
52Furthermore, Bivard et al. conducted
a pooled patient subgroup analysis of TAAIS and
ATTEST suggesting that tenecteplase compared toalteplase was associated with higher complete recanali-
zation rates at 24 h (71% vs. 43%; p<0.001) and
higher rates of three-month excellent outcome (mRS-scores of 0–1; OR 4.82, 95% CI: 1.02–7.84, P¼0.05) in
69 patients with baseline intracranial occlusion
[Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grades0–1].
55This study also suggested that vessel occlusionXVI European Stroke Journal 6(1)
status (complete vs. partial or no occlusion) was a
modifier of the effect of tenecteplase – compared withalteplase – regarding three-month functional outcome(Pfor interaction ¼0.01). Some of the included patients
had distal vessel occlusion and would therefore notcurrently be eligible for mechanical thrombectomy.
14
We have conducted a study-level meta-analysis of
EXTEND-IA TNK and the subgroup of patientswith complete vessel occlusion in the pooled analysisby Bivard et al. (Figure 7).
55The pooled OR for excel-
lent outcome and better functional outcome were 2.42(95% CI: 0.73–8.04) and 2.09 (1.16–3.76), respectively.
EXTEND-IA TNK 2 was a randomised trial com-
paring two different doses of intravenous tenecteplase(0.25 mg/kg vs. 0.4 mg/kg) within 4.5 h of stroke onsetin 300 patients who subsequently underwent mechani-cal thrombectomy.
56The proportion of patients with
greater than 50% reperfusion of the previously occlud-
ed vascular territory (eTICI /C212b50,57primary end-
point) before thrombectomy was 19% in the twoarms. There was not difference between treatmentgroups regarding functional outcome at three months(adjusted common OR for better functional outcome0.96, 95% CI: 0.74–1.24, P¼0.73) and mortality. The
rate of sICH according to the SITS-MOST definitionwas non-significantly higher in the 0.4 mg/kg arm:4.7% vs. 1.3%, RR 3.50 (95% CI: 0.74–16.62,P¼0.12).
Our recommendation is based on one small RCT,
with a non-clinical primary outcome measure and apost-hoc pooled subgroup analysis of 2 other small
RCTs (Figure 7). The quality of the evidence isgraded as low (see Table 5 for justification).
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration and with large vessel occlusion who arecandidates for mechanical thrombectomy and for
whom intravenous thrombolysis is considered
before thrombectomy, we suggest intravenousthrombolysis with tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg.

The results regarding functional outcome are based on Bivard et al.55(pooled analysis of the TAAIS50and ATTEST48trials) and the EXTEND IA TNK trial51(Figure 7). The results about death and sICH are
solely based on the EXTEND IA TNK trial.
aIn EXTEND IA TNK, tenecteplase was only significantly associated with better functional outcome in shift analysis of the mRS. Furthermore, other RCT s in unselected patients did not suggest superiority of
tenecteplase over alterplase.
bThis result is based on a secondary outcome of the EXTEND IA TNK trial and subgroup analyses of TAAIS and ATTEST . In those last 2 trials, some patients had distal vessel occlusion (M2, M3, ACA, PCA).
cThe primary endpoint was radiological, not clinical.
dOnly one event in each treatment group.XVIII European Stroke Journal 6(1)
with standard dose (0.9 mg/kg) of alteplase in 3310
patients treated with IVT within 4.5 h of stroke onset,
the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and
Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED).54The
trial aimed to show non-inferiority of the lower dose.
About two-thirds of patients were from Asia.
Unfavourable functional outcome (mRS scores 2–6)was seen in 53.2% in the low-dose and 51.1% in the
standard-dose group, which did not demonstrate non-
inferiority (OR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.95–1.25, Pfor non-infe-
riority ¼0.51).
58The rate of sICH was lower in the low-
dose group (1.0% vs. 2.1%, P¼0.01). Mortality at
three months did not differ significantly between the
groups (8.5% and 10.3%, respectively, P¼0.07). The
pre-specified subgroup analyses did not identify patients
who benefitted from the low-dose therapy.59–61but
patients using antiplatelet drugs before their strokes had
non-significantly better functional outcomes after low-
dose alteplase than other patients (OR 0.84, 95% CI:
0.62–1.12 versus OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.99–1.36, pfor inter-
action¼0.053).62,63This association was further attenu-
ated in analyses adjusted for potential confounders.62,63
The evidence for this recommendation is limited to
one trial. However, the trial was adequately powered to
address its scientific question and we could not identify
reason that would lead to downgrade the quality of
evidence regarding risk of bias, inconsistency, indirect-
ness, or imprecision. The quality of evidence was there-
fore rated as high. The trial did not show non-
inferiority of low-dose alteplase, and the recommenda-
tion is therefore strong.
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration who are eligible for intravenous throm-
bolysis, we recommend standard-dose alteplase
(0.9 mg/kg) over low-dose alteplase.Quality of evidence: High/H20003/H20003/H20003/H20003
Strength of recommendation: Strong ""
Additional information. The ENCHANTED trial did
not show non-inferiority of low-dose alteplase, despite
the fact that almost two-thirds of the patients were
from Asia (who have presumed higher risk of sICH).
There was also no imbalance in the baseline character-
istics that could explain the results. For example, the
percentage of large-artery occlusions and successful
recanalisation were similar in the two groups.
There are several older Asian registry studies that
have inconsistent results regarding the optimal dose
of alteplase in Asian populations.
64–727. Adjunctive therapies (i.e. antithrombotic agents,
ultrasound)
PICO 7.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, does antithrombotic agents in addition to IVT leadto better functional outcome than IVT alone?
Analysis of current evidence. Re-occlusion of a cere-
bral artery occurs in 14%–34% of patients who haveachieved recanalisation after IVT with alteplase, and isassociated with clinical deterioration and poor out-come.
73,74It has been suggested that the use of antith-
rombotic agents (aspirin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIainhibitors or thrombin inhibitors) during or after alte-plase infusion might reduce the risk of re-occlusion andimprove functional outcome.
75,76
The effect of intravenous aspirin as an adjunct ther-
apy to alteplase was tested in the Antiplatelet therapy
in combination with Rt-PA Thrombolysis in Ischemic
Stroke (ARTIS) trial.77A total of 642 patients treated
with alteplase were randomly assigned to 300 mg intra-venous aspirin within 90 min of alteplase bolus or to noadditional treatment. Oral antiplatelet therapy wasgiven 24 h following alteplase treatment in bothgroups. The trial was terminated prematurely becauseof an excess of sICH (assessed in a non-blinded fash-ion) and no evidence of benefit in the aspirin group.The OR for good outcome (mRS 0–2 at three months)with intravenous aspirin was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.66–1.26,P¼0.58), and the relative risk for sICH, defined as in
the third European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study(ECASS-3) trial,
78was 2.78 (95% CI: 1.01–7.63,
P¼0.04). Of note, follow-up imaging was not system-
atically performed in patients without neurologicaldeterioration.
Eptifibatide is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor that
is being investigated as an adjunct to intravenousthrombolysis. One randomised-controlled trial of 94patients compared low-dose alteplase (0.3 mg/kg and0.45 mg/kg) combined with eptifibatide to standard-dose alteplase alone, and did not raise major safetyconcerns (OR for any ICH with combination therapycompared to alteplase alone: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.06–1.23).
79Another trial randomised 126 patients 4:1 to
low-dose alteplase (0.6 mg/kg) plus eptifibatide orstandard-dose alteplase alone, and found a non-significantly lower risk of sICH in the combination
group (OR 0.15, 95% CI: 0.01–1.40, P¼0.053).
80
The safety of eptifibatide as an adjunct to alteplase
low-dose or standard-dose has also been reported inobservational studies.
81,82
We identified no RCTs of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
inhibitor tirofiban as an adjunctive therapy to alte-plase, but there are observational data hinting that tir-ofiban might be safe (no sICH in 14 patients treatedBerge et al. XIX
with tirofiban þstandard-dose alteplase), although
uncertainties remain.83
Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that has
been given as adjunct therapy to alteplase. One smallobservational study of 65 patients showed that combi-
nation therapy compared to alteplase alone had a sICH
rate of 4.6% in patients with proximal cerebral arteryocclusion.
84A RCT of 90 patients treated with alte-
plase randomised patients to no argatroban, argatro-
ban bolus followed by low-dose infusion of argatroban,
or to argotroban bolus followed by standard-dose infu-sion of argatroban for 48 h.
85No difference in the rates
of sICH was observed across the three groups (10, 13
and 7%, respectively; RR (low-dose argatrobran vs
alteplase alone:1.27; 95% CI: 0.32–5.05; RR (high-dose argatrobran vs alteplase alone:0.60; 95% CI:0.11–3.41), as were the proportions of patients withmRS scores 0–1 at 90 days (21, 30 and 32%, respective-
ly; RR (low-dose argatrobran vs alteplase alone:1.50;
95% CI: 0.64–3.49; RR (high-dose argatrobran vs alte-plase alone:1.63; 95% CI: 0.72–3.72). However, thesmall sample of this trial should be taken into account
in the interpretation of these findings.
The recommendation is based on the ARTIS trial
and very small randomized trials assessing safety rather
than efficacy. The quality of evidence is therefore
graded as low.
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, we recommend no antithrombotic drugswithin 24 h of intravenous thrombolysis over
antithrombotic drugs as an adjunct therapy to
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase.
Quality of evidence: Low/H20003/H20003
Strength of recommendation: Strong ##
Additional information. The effects of eptifibatide
and argatroban as adjuncts to alteplase will be furtherinvestigated in the ongoing phase Multi-armOptimization of Stroke Thrombolysis (MOST) trial
(NCT03735979). In this trial, 1200 patients treated
with standard-dose alteplase within three hours ofstroke onset will be randomised to intravenous arga-troban, eptifibatide or placebo, and the primary effect
variable is functional outcome at 90 days. Patients may
also receive mechanical thrombectomy per usual care.
PICO 7.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, does ultrasound augmentation of IVT lead to better
functional outcome than IVT alone?
Analysis of current evidence. Ultrasound delivers
mechanical pressure waves to the clot, exposing more
thrombus surface to circulating alteplase, which maypotentiate fibrinolytic activity.
86,87Moreover, intrave-
nous gaseous microspheres have been introduced withultrasound as an alternative to fibrinolytic agents torecanalise discrete peripheral thrombotic arterial occlu-sions or acute arteriovenous graft thromboses.
86,87
Small RCTs of high-frequency ultrasound in combina-tion with thrombolytic treatment (sometimes referredto as ‘sonothrombolysis’) have shown promising resultsin patients who did not receive mechanical thrombec-tomy.
88,89The Combined Lysis of Thrombus in Brain
Ischemia Using Transcranial Ultrasound and Systemic
t-PA (CLOTBUST) trial of transcranial ultrasound
and meta-analyses of other similar studies havereported that ultrasound could at least double thechance of early recanalisation.
90–92In the
CLOTBUST trial of 126 patients, sonothrombolysiswas also associated with a higher likelihood of excellentoutcome (secondary endpoint, mRS 0–1 at
three months) in the subgroup of patients with pre-
treatment NIHSS scores /C2110 points.
93
These findings were not reproduced in two larger
RCTs. The Norwegian Sonothrombolysis in AcuteStroke Study (NOR-SASS) randomised 183 patients
with or without evidence of proximal cerebral artery
occlusion and without a lower cut-off for baselineNIHSS score to contrast-enhanced high-frequencysonothrombolysis or IVT with alteplase alone (withsham ultrasound monitoring).
94,95The primary end-
points were neurological improvement at 24 h definedas a NIHSS score of 0 or a reduction of /C214 points
compared with baseline NIHSS, and excellent func-
tional outcome. The trial was prematurely terminatedbecause of a lack of funding. The rates of neurologicalimprovement at 24 h, excellent outcome at 90 days andsICH were similar in the two groups. Only 113 out of183 enrolled patients (61%) were treated according tostudy protocol in NOR-SASS.
The Combined Lysis of Thrombus using Ultrasound
and Systemic Tissue Plasminogen Activator forEmergent Revascularization (CLOTBUST-ER) trialenrolled 676 patients with NIHSS scores of /C2110 points
who received IVT with alteplase within 4.5 h (3 h in
North America) and were randomised to ultrasound
enhancement of IVT or sham.
96,97Vascular imaging
was not mandatory and mechanical thrombectomywas not performed. The primary endpoint was improve-ment in the mRS-score at 90 days. The trial was stoppedearly because of futility. The adjusted cOR for betterfunctional outcome was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.77–1.45,
P¼0.74) for patients treated within three hours and
1.06 (95% CI: 0.80–1.42, P¼0.67) for patients treated
within 4.5 h. There was no difference in three-monthmortality (OR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.74–1.92, P¼0.48) or
sICH (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 0.51–3.95, P¼0.52).XX European Stroke Journal 6(1)
We performed a meta-analysis of the five largest
RCTs88–90,95,97and found no benefit in terms of excel-

plase versus alteplase alone (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.77–
1.50, P¼0.68, I2¼12%, Figure 8).
The recommendation is based on the results of the
meta-analysis including two phase 3 and three phase 2
RCTs. The quality of evidence was judged to be low
(see Table 6 for justification).

8. Higher age, multimorbidity, frailty or prior
disability
PICO 8.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who are over 80 years of age, does IVT with
alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Most trials of IVT for
ischaemic stroke have excluded patients who were over
80 years old or who had multimorbidity/frailty or pre-
stroke disability. IST-3 included patients over 80 years
of age and added substantial information on this
patient group.9Information about the effect of alte-
plase in elderly patients can also be found in meta-
analyses of RCTs, either with individual patient
data8,26,98or on study-level.6In the meta-analysis of individual participant data
by Emberson et al., the OR for excellent outcome
(mRS score 0–1) in patients >80 years treated with alte-
plase was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.17–2.08), compared to 1.25
(95% CI: 1.10–1.42) in patients /C2080 years of age, with-
out evidence of difference in efficacy between the
groups ( Pfor interaction ¼0.53).26There was also no
evidence in the pooled analysis that patients aged
>80 years were at any greater risk of ICH than younger
patients. Furthermore, age was not associated with
increased risk of sICH in the ENCHANTED trial.59
The Thrombolysis in Elderly Stroke Patients in Italy
(TESPI) trial, which investigated IVT with alteplase
within three hours of stroke onset in 191 patients over
the age of 80 years, was terminated early because the
IST-3 trial provided evidence of treatment benefit in in
this age group.99The trial was underpowered and
showed a non-significant effect on the proportion of
good outcome (mRS score 0–2: 29% versus 23%).
The recommendation for patients who are over
80 years of age is based on an individual patient data
meta-analysis of high quality.8,98

Expert consensus statement
Nine of nine group members believe that age alone
should not be a limiting factor for IVT, even in
other situations covered in the present guidelines
Figure 8. Pooled odds ratio for excellent outcome (mRS 0–1) in patients randomized to ultrasound augmentation of IVT vs. IVT

(e.g. wake-up stroke; ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h
duration (known onset time) with CT or MRI
core/perfusion mismatch; minor stroke with dis-
abling symptoms).
PICO 8.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have multimorbidity, frailty or prior disability,does intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase lead to betterfunctional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. The literature search
identified no trials that targeted patients with multi-morbidity/frailty or those with pre-stroke disability.An analysis of observational data from 3017 patients
in IST-3 used brain imaging findings before treatment
with alteplase to identify patients with pre-existing‘brain frailty’, such as old lesions, brain atrophy orleukoaraiosis. The risk of sICH was higher in patientswith old infarct (OR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.18–2.51), and thechance of excellent functional outcome was lower
(severe leukoaraiosis: OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50–0.78;
severe brain atrophy: OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57–0.99;old infarct: OR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.96).
100
However, no imaging findings, individually or com-bined, modified the effect of alteplase on functionaloutcome or sICH.
100Renal dysfunction, which is
another marker of multimorbidity, was not associated
with increased risk of sICH in the ENCHANTEDtrial,
60but was associated with increased risk of other
haemorrhagic complications, death and poor function-al outcome before and after adjustment for potentialconfounders in meta-analyses of observational stud-
ies.
101–104Finally, one observational study of patients
with non-metastatic cancer, found that functional out-come after IVT with alteplase was comparable to thatof other patients.
105These findings suggest that cancer
should not be an absolute contraindication againstthrombolytic treatment, although caution seems
appropriate.
Patients with pre-existing disability are often not
treated with alteplase.
106Despite high mortality rates,
observational studies of patients with pre-existing dis-
ability have indicated that IVT may prevent furtherfunctional deterioration and that treatment is morebeneficial the earlier it is given.
107,108Observational
studies have not found evidence that pre-stroke disabil-ity is associated with an increased risk of ICH after
thrombolytic treatment.
107,109,110
The recommendations for patients with multimor-
bidity, frailty or pre-stroke disability is based on
small observational studies, corresponding to a very
low quality of evidence.

9. Minor stroke and stroke with rapidly improving
neurological signs
PICO 9.1 In patients with acute minor, disabling ischaemic
stroke of <4.5 h duration, does IVT with alteplase lead to
better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. About half of all ischae-
mic strokes are initially minor (defined typically asNIHSS score <5), but up to one third of patients
with minor stroke are disabled or dead three monthsafter the index event.
112,113Emberson et al. conducted
an individual participant data meta-analysis of 9 RCTsof IVT with alteplase vs. placebo or open control,which included 666 patients (10%) with a baselineNIHSS score 0–4.
8All trials included in this meta-
analysis excluded patients with non-disabling neurolog-ical deficits, except IST-3.
9The meta-analysis showed
that the proportional benefit of alteplase was not sta-tistically different in patients with mild, moderate andsevere strokes ( Pfor interaction ¼0.06). In patients
with baseline NIHSS score of 0–4, the OR for excellentoutcome (mRS score 0–1 at three months) was 1.48(95% CI: 1.07–2.06). These data support the use ofalteplase in patients with minor disabling stroke.
One critical question is how ‘minor disabling
stroke’ should be defined in clinical practice. No stan-dardized definition has been used across trials includ-ed in the present meta-analysis, which relied on thesubjective judgment of each investigator. An opera-tional definition of a disabling deficit has since beenproposed in the Potential of Rt-PA for IschemicStrokes with Mild Symptoms (PRISMS) trial: ‘a def-icit that, if unchanged, would prevent the patient fromperforming basic activities of daily living (i.e., bathing,
ambulating, toileting, hygiene, and eating) or return-
ing to work’.
114
The quality of evidence for the recommendation is
moderate (see Table 7 for justification).

PICO 9.2 In patients with acute minor, non-disabling ischaemic
stroke of <4.5 h duration, does IVT with alteplase lead to
better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients with minor
neurological deficits (NIHSS score 0–5) judged to not
be clearly disabling within three hours of stroke onset
were assessed in the PRISMS trial of IVT with alte-
plase vs. aspirin.
114A disabling deficit was defined as ‘a
deficit that, if unchanged, would prevent the patient
from performing basic activities of daily living (ie,
bathing/dressing, ambulating, toileting, hygiene, and
eating) or returning to work’. Due to slow recruitment
and insufficient funding, the trial was terminated after
inclusion of 313 patients, while the calculated sample
size was 948. The adjusted risk difference for excellent
outcome (mRS 0–1 at three months) with alteplase
was –1.1% (95% CI: –9.4 to 7.3%) and the cOR for
better functional outcome was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.5–1.2).The risk of sICH (defined as any neurological wors-
ening within 36 h attributed to ICH by local investi-
gators) was significantly higher in the alteplase group
(risk difference 3.3%, 95% CI: 0.8–7.4), and there
were more patients with serious adverse events
(mostly intracranial/intracerebral hemorrhage) in the
alteplase group (risk difference 12.9%, 95% CI: 4.1–
21.7%). A limitation of this trial was missing three-
month mRS score evaluations in 10% of enrolled
patients.
Because IST-3 had not explicitly excluded patients
with non-disabling neurological deficits, we also used
data from that trial.
9Among the subgroup of patients
with NIHSS 0–5 in IST-3, the adjusted OR for good
functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale score 0–2)
with alteplase was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.52–1.38).
The recommendation is based on one relatively
small RCT that was stopped early and one trial that
did not explicitly exclude patients with non-disabling
ischaemic stroke. The quality of the evidence is there-fore graded as moderate.Berge et al. XXIII
Recommendation
For patients with acute minor non-disabling
ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h duration, we suggest
no intravenous thrombolysis. For patients withminor stroke and large-vessel occlusion, please
refer to the section below (PICO 9.3).

Additional information. A list of examples of non-
disabling symptoms was provided to each participating
centre in the PRISMS trial and in the published proto-
col
115: isolated mild aphasia (patient still able to com-
municate meaningfully), isolated facial droop, mild
cortical hand (especially non-dominant: NIHSS score-
¼0), mild hemimotor loss, hemisensory loss, mild
hemisensorimotor loss and mild hemiataxia (patient
still able to ambulate). Importantly, the two most
common neurological deficits of patients enrolled in
PRISMS were mild sensory loss (46%) and facial
palsy (39%).
PICO 9.3 In patients with acute minor, non-disabling ischaemic
stroke of <4.5 h duration, and with proven large vessel occlu-
sion, does IVT with alteplase lead to better functional outcome
than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients with large
vessel occlusion have a higher risk of stroke progres-
sion and poor prognosis than other patients.116The
literature search identified no RCT of IVT with alte-
plase in patients with NIHSS scores of 0–5 with non-
disabling neurologic deficits and with proven intracra-
nial large artery occlusion. TEMPO-1 was a case seriesof 50 patients with NIHSS sores 0–5 (disabling or non-
disabling symptoms) who were given tenecteplase 0.1
or 0.25 mg/kg for acute ischaemic stroke due to any
proven and relevant intracranial occlusion.
117The
TEMPO-2 trial (NCT02398656) is an ongoing RCT
that compares tenecteplase with standard care in a sim-
ilar population.

large-vessel occlusion, 6 of 8 group members sug-gest intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase.

Analysis of current evidence. We found no evidence
of direct relevance for this question. The literaturesearch did not identify any RCT of IVT in patientswith rapidly improving symptoms, although thePRISMS trial included about 5% of such patients.
114
One large observational study of 29,200 patients withmild or rapidly improving symptoms, who did notreceive IVT, showed that unfavourable outcomes
were common (28.3% were not discharged to home,
and 28.5% were unable to ambulate without assistanceat hospital discharge), and strongly associated withbaseline NIHSS score.

Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h

Additional information. Rapidly improving stroke
symptoms were a contraindication in the NINDStrial.
17The original intent was to avoid inclusion of
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients, who recover
completely without treatment.121A working group of
investigators from the pivotal NINDS trial that
reviewed this exclusion criterion concluded that
patients with improvement of any degree, but with a
persisting neurological deficit that is potentially dis-abling, should be treated with alteplase.
121The authors
performed structured interviews of the original NINDS
clinical trialists to form this conclusion.
Expert consensus statement
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and rapidly improving neurological
signs, which are still disabling, 8 of 9 group mem-bers suggest intravenous thrombolysis with
alteplase.
The group agreed that the treatment decisionshould be based on the clinical status at presenta-
tion, and that it is not justifiable to wait for reso-
lution of symptoms.
10. Severe stroke
PICO 10.1 In patients with severe acute ischaemic stroke
of<4.5 h duration, does IVT with alteplase lead to better
functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Severe stroke can be
defined clinically (e.g. NIHSS score >25), or with CT
or other brain imaging prior to IVT, e.g. visible infarc-
tion in more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery
territory or an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT
Score (ASPECTS) of <7.122
Clinically severe stroke. A study-level meta-analysis
classified RCTs recruiting patient with ‘more severe
stroke’ as trials with a case fatality of /C2120% in the
control group.6There was no evidence of heterogeneity
in the effect of IVT with alteplase on death or disability
between trials with different levels of average stroke
severity, but this study did not use the threshold of
NIHSS score 25 to define severe stroke.
In the individual participant data meta-analysis by
Emberson et al,8there was no clear evidence of hetero-
geneity in the effect of alteplase on excellent outcome(mRS 0–1) between groups of patients with different
baseline NIHSS scores, after controlling for age and
time to treatment ( pfor interaction ¼0.06). In the
622 participants with the highest level of stroke severity
(NIHSS score /C2122) alteplase improved the odds of
excellent outcome (OR 3.25, 95% CI: 1.42–7.47;
Table 8).
8Regarding for better functional outcome),
there was no evidence of an interaction ( PforBerge et al. XXV
interaction ¼0.72) between higher NIHSS score and
lesser benefit from alteplase.26
In IST-3, where the subgroup of patients with
NIHSS score /C2125 was reported specifically, there was
evidence of an interaction ( P¼0.003) between stroke
severity and the effect alteplase on good outcome (mRS
score 0–2), with greater relative benefit in patients with
more severe stroke. In the small subgroup of 146patients with the most severe strokes (NIHSS scores
/C2125) alteplase-treated patients were non-significantly
more likely to have a good outcome than patients inthe control group (OR 7.43, 95% CI: 0.43–129.0).
9
The individual participant data meta-analysis
showed that the absolute risk of fatal ICH due toIVT with alteplase was highest in those participantswith the highest stroke severity (NIHSS scores /C2122,
6.8% vs 0.6%; Table 8),
8although the odds of fatal
ICH with alteplase was similar in patients with high orlow stroke severity. Altogether, these studies do not
provide evidence that patients with the highest level
of stroke severity have a lesser proportional benefitfrom alteplase.
Extensive ischaemic change on baseline imaging.
Studies have also used brain imaging to define severe
stroke. A Cochrane review did not demonstrate any
important statistical difference between the effect ofalteplase in those with more and in those with lessextensive ischaemic change on baseline CT scan.
6We
found no individual participant data meta-analysis of
baseline brain imaging findings in patients in the largetrials of alteplase. Although the presence of a greater
degree of low attenuation on brain CT is associated
with a much poorer outcome after ischaemicstroke,
123,124there is no evidence that patients with
larger lesion or with more tissue attenuation benefit
less from alteplase in analyses from 3 individualtrials, after adjustment for time to randomisa-tion.
100,125,126However, there is no trial specifically
addressing this question, and extensive baseline ische-
mia was an exclusion criteria in the major IVT trials.
We have conducted a study-level meta-analysis of 3
trials in which inclusion of patients in spite of an early
ischemic change of more than 1/3 of the middle cere-bral artery territory was permitted (IST-3, NINDS and
ECASS I).
100,125,127The unadjusted pooled ORs for
‘favourable’ outcome (mRS 0–1 at three months inNINDS and ECASS I, Oxford Handicap Score 0–2at six months) were 1.65 (0.38–7.20) and 1.55 (1.05–
2.28) in patients with and without early ischemic
change of more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral arteryterritory (Figure 9). We found no evidence that the
presence of an early ischemic change of more than 1/
3 of middle cerebral artery territory significantly modi-fies the effect of IVT on favourable outcome ( Pfor

aAlthough the 9 RCTs included in the individual patient data meta-analysis had patients with NIHSS /C2122, in many trials, patients with clinically very severe stroke (e.g. NIHSS >25 in ECASS-3) or
radiologically severe stroke (e.g. attenuation of >1/3 of the MCA in ECASS 2 and ATLANTIS B) were excluded. Therefore, a selection bias is likely: patients with clinically severe stroke were not
indiscriminately randomized in those trials.
bThis result is based on an independent patient data meta-analysis of subgroups of 9 trials, and was restricted to patients with NIHSS /C2122. It is uncertain whether those results would also apply to patients
with very severe stroke (e.g., NIHSS >25 or coma).

interaction ¼0.67). However, we observed a significant
interaction of the presence of early ischemic changeson baseline CT on the association of IVT withthree-month mortality ( Pfor interaction ¼0.005).
Patients treated with alteplase were at higher odds ofthree-month mortality compared with patients nottreated with IVT (OR 3.90, 95% CI: 1.42–10.68;Figure 10).An ASPECTS of <7 has also been used to define
severe stroke.
128
The recommendation for patients with clinically
severe acute ischaemic stroke is based on meta-analyses of a number of RCTs. The quality of the evi-dence is moderate (Table 8). For severe stroke definedby the extent of ischaemic change on CT the recom-mendation is based on fewer data from fewer trials.

Additional information. The European Medicine
Agency stipulates in the product insert for Actilysethat ‘ Patients with severe stroke (as assessed clinically
[NIHSS score >25] and/or by appropriate imaging
techniques) ...at baseline should not be treated with
Actilyse ’ because ‘ patients with very severe stroke are
at higher risk for intracerebral haemorrhage and death ’.
Expert consensus statement
Seven of nine group members voted for intrave-
nous thrombolysis with alteplase in selected
patients with severe stroke associated with extend-
ed radiological signs of infarction (e.g., early ische-mic change of more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral
artery territory or ASPECTS <7 on plain CT).
Patient selection criteria might include eligibilityfor an alternative reperfusion strategy (mechanical
thrombectomy), results of advanced imaging (nota-
bly core/perfusion mismatch), time since symptomonset, extent of white matter lesions, other contra-
indications for IVT, and pre-stroke disability.
11. High blood pressure and high blood glucose level
PICO 11.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and with persistently increased blood pressure above185/110 mmHg, even after blood pressure lowering treatment,
does IVT with alteplase lead to better functional outcome than
no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Increased blood pres-
sure is a common finding during the first hours ofischaemic stroke, and may be considered an adaptivephysiological response aiming to improve cerebral per-fusion. However, increased blood pressure may alsoincrease the risk of sICH after IVT. The majority of
the RCTs of IVT with alteplase therefore excludedpatients with systolic blood pressure >185 mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure >110 mmHg, and aimed to
maintain blood pressure below these values duringthe first 24 h.
In IST-3, an analysis by subgroups of baseline sys-
tolic (<143, 144–164, >164 mmHg) or diastolic blood
pressure did not show a modification in the effect of
alteplase on sICH, death at seven days, or functional
outcome at six months.
129However, results for patients
with systolic blood pressure >185 mmHg have not been
published.
While analyses of RCTs have not shown an effect
modification of IVT by high blood pressure, a numberof analyses of observational data have shown that high
blood pressure is associated with poorer prognosis. In
patients treated with alteplase in the ECASS-2 trial,higher baseline, maximum, mean (per 10 mmHg
increase), and variability of systolic blood pressure
were all inversely associated with excellent outcome(mRS score 0–1) at three months (OR 0.84, 95% CI:
0.74–0.94; OR ¼0.82, 95% CI: 0.73–0.91; OR ¼0.81,

131In addition, a single-centre observational
study reported that pretreatment blood pressure limitviolations (systolic blood pressure >185 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure >110 mmHg) occurred frequent-

Note: These results are based on the ECASS-1, NINDS and IST -3 studies.
aSelection bias: it is plausible that all patients with very extensive signs of brain infarction on baseline imaging were not systematically randomiz ed. Besides, because advanced imaging was not used, it is likely
that the included population is heterogeneous, consisting of patients with and without residual salvageable (penumbral) tissue despite extensive infarction.
bA strong benefit of IVT was observed in the NINDS trial (OR for favourable outcome 6.8; 95% CI: 1.30–36.2), whereas a trend towards deleterious effect w as observed in ECASS-1 (OR for favourable
outcome 0.4; 95% CI: 0.10–2.70).
cIn IST -3 and ECASS-1, patients could be treated up to six hours after symptom onset. In IST -3, to our knowledge extent of early ischemic change was not sp ecifically reported as less or more than 1/3 of the
MCA territory but according to 4 categories, of which the authors considered ‘large or very large’ to correspond to more than 1/3 of the MCA territory.100Conversely, in NINDS and ECASS-1, all baseline
images were centrally reviewed and classified as less or more than 1/3 of the MCA territory.125
dThe confidence interval is wide. However, in our meta-analysis we found evidence that presence of early ischaemic changes >1/3 of the middle cerebral artery territory modifies the effect of IVT on
mortality at three months ( Pfor interaction ¼0.005).
eRegarding IST -3, we could not find published data on the raw numbers or ORs for the association between IVT and death at six months, stratified by the ext end of early ischaemic changes.Berge et al. XXIX

2¼29%, and OR 0.70, 95% CI:

Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h

blood pressure >185 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure >110 mm Hg even after blood pressure
lowering treatment, we suggest no intravenous

Additional information. It should be noted that,
based on current acute antihypertensive treatment
options, persistent elevated blood pressure of >185/
110 excluding patients from treatment is uncommon.
There is evidence suggesting that it is also important
to monitor blood pressure after treatment with alte-plase. In a cohort of 1868 patients treated with alte-plase, patients with sICH had significantly higher
systolic blood pressure at several time-points after
IVT compared with those without sICH ( P<0.01 at
2 and 4 h; P<0.05 at 12 and 48 h). The odds ratios for
development of sICH per 10 mmHg increase in blood
pressure at 2, 4, 12 and 48 h were 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03–
1.25), 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03–1.25), 1.12 (95% CI: 1.01–1.23) and 1.12 (95% CI: 1.01–1.23), respectively.

PICO 11.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and with increased blood pressure above 185/110 mm Hg, which has subsequently been lowered to below185/110 mm Hg, does IVT with alteplase lead to better
functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Blood pressure lowering
treatment to values below 185/110 mmHg was allowed
in all completed RCTs of IVT with alteplase versus
control, and so the results of these trials apply tothese patients.
In the ENCHANTED trial, 2196 patients with sys-
tolic blood pressure >150 mmHg and <185/110 mmHg
who were eligible for IVT with alteplase were rando-
mised to intensive blood pressure lowering (target sys-
tolic blood pressure 130–140 mm Hg within 1 h) or to atarget systolic blood pressure <180 mm Hg, and to keep
blood pressure in that range over 72 h.

between groups (unadjusted cOR for better functional
outcome 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87–1.17, P¼0.87). Fewer
patients in the intensive group (14.8%) than in the con-trol group (18.7%) had any ICH (OR 0.75, 0.60–0.94,P¼0.01). Blood pressure reduction was also related to a
non-significant decrease in type 2 parenchymal haemor-
rhage (OR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50–1.01).
An analysis of observational data from IST-3 indi-
cated that the use of blood pressure lowering treatmentduring the first 24 h were associated with a reduced riskof poor outcome (Oxford handicap scale 3–6) at
six months (OR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65–0.93, P¼0.007),
irrespective of whether the patient was given alteplaseor not (p for interaction >0.05).
131However, analyses
of the effect of blood pressure lowering treatment using
observational data from the NINDS trial did not pro-vide conclusive results.

PICO 11.4 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and with blood glucose level above >22.2 mmol/L
(>400 mg/dL), does IVT with alteplase lead to better
functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Hyperglycaemia in the
acute phase may represent stress, underlying impaired
glucose tolerance or unrecognised diabetes mellitus.Higher blood glucose level at admission has been con-sistently associated with poorer functional outcomeand sICH in acute ischemic stroke patients treatedwith or without IVT.
139,140However, blood glucose
level was not a modifier of the effect of alteplase onfunctional outcome in RCTs.
9,129It is uncertain wheth-
er this also holds true for patients with very high blood
glucose levels ( >22.2 mmol/L, >400 mg/dL) because
they were not included in RCTs, owing to concernsof an increased risk of sICH,
122but also because hyper-
glycaemia can present with focal neurological deficitsthat mimic acute stroke.
141
We identified only one observational study allowing
the comparison of IVT and no IVT in acute ischaemicstroke patients with blood glucose levels >22.2 mmol/
L. In this analysis of 9613 patients from the VirtualInternational Stroke Trials Registry (VISTA), only 23
patients had blood glucose levels >22.2 mmol/L. Of
these, 6 had been treated with alteplase, and in thisvery small group no cases of sICH were observed.
142
Compared with patients not treated with IVT, thosewho received IVT had a cOR for better functional out-come of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.19–5.91) and an OR for excel-lent functional outcome of 1.31 (0.08–20.61).
Large observational registries of patients treated
with IVT provide some insight on the risk of sICH inpatients with very high blood glucose levels. Out of56,258 patients treated with IVT in the SITS registry,baseline blood glucose levels >22.2 mmol/L were docu-
mented in 91 patients and independently associated
with a higher risk of sICH according to ECASS-2 cri-teria (OR 1.99, 95% CI: 1.01–3.92).
133The incidence
rate of sICH was 9.9% (95% CI: 5.3%–17.7%) and3.3% (95% CI: 1.1–9.4%) according to the ECASS-2and SITS definitions, respectively.
Of note, persistent hyperglycemia may be a more
important predictor of poor functional outcome thanbaseline hyperglycemia in patients with acute ischaemicstroke.
143
Given the lack of evidence of an heterogeneity in the
effect of alteplase in patients with higher blood glucoselevels, and the available data regarding the risk of sICHin patients with glucose level >22.2 mmol/L, we believe
that alteplase should not be withheld in these patients,
even though they have a substantial risk of poor func-tional outcome.Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and with blood glucose levels above
22.2 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), we suggest intravenousthrombolysis with alteplase.

Additional information. In an analysis of 16,049
patients treated with alteplase and included in the
SITS registry,145blood glucose as a continuous vari-
able was independently associated with a higher casefatality ( p<0.001), poorer functional outcome
(p<0.001) and increased risk of sICH ( P¼0.005).
Compared to patients with blood glucose level 80–
120 mg/dL, patients with blood glucose from 181 to
200 mg/dL had an increased risk of sICH (OR 2.86,95% CI: 1.69–4.83, p<0.001). The associations
between blood glucose and outcomes were similar in
patients with or without diabetes mellitus, except for
case fatality ( pfor interaction <0.001) and sICH ( pfor
interaction ¼0.02), for which the associations were not
statistically significant in patients with diabetes
mellitus.
In the SITS-EAST registry, 14 of 5461 patients
(0.3%) had blood glucose levels >22.2 mmol/L, and
these patients had an increased rate of sICH (unad-
justed OR 5.91, 95% CI: 1.18–12.5, P¼0.03) and
unfavourable functional outcome (adjusted OR 8.59,95% CI: 0.88–83.9 P¼0.06).

(63%) received IVT. The proportion of patients withfavourable outcome at 90 days did not differ in the two
arms of the trial (20.5% vs. 21.6%) and in the sub-
group of patients receiving IVT (23.0% vs. 24.9%).The number of patients who received blood glucose
lowering therapy prior to alteplase bolus was not

12. Use of antithrombotic drugs before the stroke
PICO 12.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who use antiplatelet agents, does IVT with alteplaselead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Treatment with antipla-
telet agents before an ischaemic stroke may increase the
risk of sICH in patients given alteplase,
149but antipla-
telet treatment was not an exclusion criterion in thecompleted RCTs. Some of those trials have analysed
separately patients who used an antiplatelet agentbefore stroke onset. A secondary analysis of IST-3
showed that the proportion of sICH in patients treatedwith antiplatelet therapy within the previous 48 hbefore stroke onset was 9% for those allocated alte-plase versus 1% in control, compared with 5% foralteplase and 1% control for those with no recent anti-platelet therapy ( P¼0.019 for interaction).
129A sec-
ondary analysis of the ENCHANTED trial indicatedan association between standard-dose alteplase andrisk of sICH in patients receiving antiplatelets beforethe stroke,
62but antiplatelet pre-treatment was not
associated with worse functional outcome after adjust-ment for potential confounders.
63
Meta-analyses of observational data from RCTs or
from a combination of RCTs and observational studiesindicated that antiplatelet agents increased the risk ofsICH in unadjusted analyses (absolute increase 6.5%,95% CI: 5.8–7.6%),
63but not after adjustment for con-
founders.150–152Another analysis of observational data,
from VISTA, indicated that alteplase compared to noalteplase improved functional outcome in patients whohad received pre-treatment with a single antiplateletagent (common OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.19–1.70).
142
The literature search identified no RCT of IVT in
patients using dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) beforethe stroke. The VISTA analysis showed a relatively highrisk of sICH in patients receiving DAPT (8.5%, 95%CI: 3.9–17.2%), but the analysis was unadjusted and theincrease in sICH was statistically non-significant.
142
Similarly, an analysis of patients given IVT within theStroke–Acute Ischemic–NXY Treatment (SAINT) I andII trials indicated that DAPT was associated with ahigher risk of sICH but not with a higher risk of poorfunctional outcome (mRS score 3–6) at three months.
153
Other studies have used propensity score matching toattempt to account for imbalances between patientswith and without DAPT. These studies indicate thatpatients who use DAPT before IVT with alteplasehave comparable sICH rates and comparable functionaloutcome and survival at three months compared withpatients who don’t use antiplatelet drugs.
154,155
Finally, a recent meta-analysis of 9 observational
studies comprising 66,675 acute ischaemic strokepatients treated with IVT failed to document any asso-ciation between DAPT and the likelihood of sICH,three-month good functional outcome (mRS 0–2),three-month excellent functional outcome (mRS 0–1),and three-month mortality in adjusted analyses con-trolling for potential confounders.
156
In summary, analyses of observational data indicate
that single or dual antiplatelet pre-treatment is notindependently associated with poorer functional out-come and higher risk of sICH. Use of antiplateletagents should therefore not be used as a reason toXXXII European Stroke Journal 6(1)
withhold IVT with alteplase in patients with acute
ischaemic stroke, although more research is needed.

PICO 12.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who use vitamin K antagonists, does IVT withalteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients given vitamin
K antagonists (VKA) and with InternationalNormalized Ratio (INR) >1.7 were excluded from
the RCTs of IVT, and the European license for alte-
plase precludes treatment in all patients taking VKA.
In a systematic review and meta-analysis of observa-tional studies,
15725 of 240 patients (10.4%) who used
VKA (median INR 1.14–1.5) experienced an sICH,compared with 184 of 3391 patients (5.4%) without
VKA medication (OR 2.58, 95% CI: 1.13–5.89,
P¼0.02; I
2¼56%). However, VKA use was not asso-
ciated with poor functional outcome (mRS /C213, OR
1.18, 95% CI: 0.85–1.61, P¼0.32; I2¼15%) or death
(OR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.85–1.75, P¼0.28; I2¼0%).
Among 45,074 patients from the SITS registry
treated with alteplase, 768 (1.7%) used warfarin andhad INR /C201.7.
158After adjustment for potential con-
founders, warfarin use was not significantly associated
with sICH (adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.82–1.70), andno increase in poor functional outcome or death atthree months was observed. Among 23,437 patientstreated with alteplase in the U.S. Get With The
Guidelines Registry, 1802 (7.7%) were treated with
warfarin with an INR /C201.7 (median 1.20; IQR 1.07–
1.40). After adjustment for potential confounders, war-farin use was not significantly associated with sICH(adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.82–1.25), serious system-
ic haemorrhage, or in-hospital death.
159
In patients with INR /C201.7, other large registries159–161
have also indicated that IVT with alteplase is associated
with a low risk of sICH and poor outcomes, both in the
0–3 and in the 3–4.5 h time windows, although this may
have been due to confounding.160Moreover, data from
VISTA showed that alteplase was associated withimproved functional outcome in patients given VKA
and with INR /C201.7 (cOR for better functional outcome
2.20, 95% CI: 1.12–4.32; Table 10).
142
There is little data on the rates of sICH in patients
using VKA and INR >1.7, and the reported rates arehighly variable (0% in 14 patients,1423% in 33
patients159and 30% in 10 patients162).

However, prothrombin complex concentrates might

PICO 12.3 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who use NOACs, does IVT with alteplase lead to
better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. The use of non-VKA
oral anticoagulants (NOACs, i.e. direct thrombin
inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors) may increase the
risk of sICH after IVT with alteplase, and alteplase is
contraindicated if NOAC has been used during the last
48 h before stroke onset, according to the labels for
these drugs.
In an observational study of 51 patients taking
DOACs and 390 patients treated with VKA, sICH
after intravenous alteplase occurred in 4.0% of patients
taking NOACs and 3.6% of patients taking VKA (no
significant difference).169Out of 42,887 patients treated
with alteplase in the Get With The Guidelines Registry,
251 (0.6%) were treated with NOACs and 1,500 (3.5%)
with warfarin.170Compared with patients withoutBerge et al. XXXIII
anticoagulants, the adjusted OR for sICH was 0.92
(95% CI: 0.51–1.65) for those on NOACs and 0.85(95% CI: 0.66–1.10) for those on warfarin. There
were also no significant differences across the three
groups in the risk for serious systemic haemorrhageor in-hospital deaths.
A recent meta-analysis of cohort studies reported no
additional risk of sICH following IVT among selectedpatients taking NOACs within 48 h compared to
patients treated with warfarin (ECASS-2 criteria: OR
0.77, 95% CI: 0.28–2.16) and compared to patientswithout anticoagulation pretreatment (OR, 0.87, 95%
CI: 0.32–2.41).
171Patient selection was based on vari-
ous coagulation assays.
A number of decision algorithms have been pro-
posed to identify patients treated with NOACs who
can be given IVT.165,172–175According to these algo-
rithms, thrombolytic treatment can be given (i) inpatients using dabigatran if thrombin time is
normal
172or below 60 seconds,173(ii) in patients
using rivaroxaban if the drug plasma level is <20 ng/
ml174or<50 ng/ml,173or if anti-Xa activity is <0.5 U/
ml,173(iii) in patients using apixaban if anti-Xa activity
is<0.5 U/ml,173(iv) in patients using edoxaban if anti-
Xa activity <0.5 U/ml.173The safety of these treatment
decision algorithms has not been tested in clinical prac-
tice, with the exception of the cut-off plasma level of
rivaroxaban ( <20ng/ml).174The coagulation parame-
ters used to select patients for IVT in these studies
were different, and global coagulation tests, such as
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplas-tin time (aPTT) and INR are not specific for NOACs.
Further research is therefore needed to identify the
optimal coagulation parameters (e.g. thrombin timefor dabigatran, direct factor Xa activity for rivaroxa-ban, apixaban and edoxaban, or individual NOAC
plasma levels). Until such data are available, we believe
that IVT with alteplase should not be used indiscrimi-nately in patients who have received a NOAC dose
within the last 48 h in patients with normal renal
function.
Others have proposed the use of agents to reverse
the anticoagulant effects of NOACs.
172–174For exam-
ple, idarucizumab has been used to reverse dabigatranactivity before alteplase treatment, and this treatment
algorithm has been tested in small studies in the pre-
hospital and hospital settings.
176–178However, there
are theoretical concerns that idarucizumab may poten-tiate the prothrombotic activity in the acute phase of
ischaemic stroke, and increase the risk of ischaemic
events.
172Nevertheless, such complications were not
documented in two national cohorts from Germany
and New Zealand reporting the experience of IVT for
acute ischaemic stroke patients pretreated with idaru-cizumab for dabigatran reversal.

aAn important risk of bias, notably of selection bias and confounding, exists in this pooled analysis based on RCTs of neuroprotectants. However, we co nsider that those limitations are already taken into
account in mentioning in GRADEpro that this analysis corresponds to an observantional study and have therefore not further downgraded the quality of evidence.

Additional information. Measurement of anti-Xa
activity has been proposed to select acute ischaemic
stroke patients pretreated with factor Xa inhibitors
for IVT, particularly where NOAC drug levels are
not readily available.
173Of note, mechanical thrombec-
tomy appears to be safe in patients with large vessel
occlusion who have used a NOAC within last 48 h of
symptom onset.168,172–174,180
Andexanet alfa is a modified recombinant factor Xa.
It is catalytically inactive and cannot participate in
coagulation, but it retains the ability to bind to and
sequester factor Xa inhibitors. It has been conditionallyapproved by US FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) in 2018 and European Medicines
Agency in 2019 for the reversal of the anticoagulant
effects of the Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban or rivar-
oxaban) in patients experiencing uncontrolled or life-
threatening bleeding based on the results of the
ANNEXA-4 study.
181Andexanet alfa could reverse
the anticoagulant effects of Factor Xa inhibitors inacute ischaemic stroke patients otherwise eligible for
IVT who have been pretreated with apixaban or rivar-
oxaban. However, there is only anecdotal published
evidence about acute ischaemic stroke patients treated
with IVT following rivaroxaban or apixaban reversal
with andexanet alfa. Importantly, the infusion of
andexanet alfa requires two hours, which may have
implications for the eligibility of patients to receive
alteplase with regard to the approved time window of
4.5 h.182Furthermore, a rebound effect of anti-Xa
activity may occur. In contrast to idarucizumab in
patients treated with dabigatran, andexanet alpha has
not been approved for reversing Factor Xa inhibitor
activity in patients who require emergency surgery/
urgent procedures.183,184Besides, the cost of andexanet
alfa, which has not been approved for edoxaban rever-
sal,184is considerable.182Finally, a safety analysis con-
ducted in the overall ANNEXA-4 study population has
documented 40 thrombotic events (7 myocardial infarc-
tions, 15 transient ischemic attacks or ischaemic
strokes, 18 venous thromboembolic events) occurring
in 34 (10%) patients at 30 days.181Eleven patients had
a thromboembolic event within five days of receivingandexanet alfa and 8 patients had an event after
restarting anticoagulation.
181Therefore, the U.S.
FDA prescribing information for andexanet alfa
includes a black box warning regarding the risk of
venous and arterial thromboembolic events.185
In summary, we caution against the off-label use of
andexanet alfa for reversal of anticoagulant activity of
apixaban or rivaroxaban in acute ischaemic stroke
patients who are otherwise eligible for IVT.

13. Potential risk factors for bleeding
An increased risk of bleeding after IVT can be sus-
pected in many clinical situations, but the literaturesearch identified no RCT to guide treatment in such
situations. Many observational studies have focused on
this topic, often comparing outcomes after IVT inpatients with and without a bleeding-prone condition.
Although this might identify risk factors for ICH,
RCTs would be needed to formally demonstrate or dis-card a greater harm with IVT in patients with these
factors.
PICO 13.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have low platelet count, does IVT with alteplaselead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients with a platelet
count below 100,000/mm
3.A platelet count below
100/C2109/L (100,000/mm3) was an exclusion criterion
in all RCTs of IVT with alteplase except ECASS I and
IST-3. We could not find a subgroup analysis ofpatients with a platelet count below 100 /C210
9/L in
these two trials. In an observational study from ten
European centres including 7,533 patients given alte-plase, 595 (7.9%) had thrombocytopenia ( <150/C210
9/
L) and 44 (0.6%) a platelet count below 100 /C2109/L.157
Thrombocytopenia was not associated with poor func-
tional outcome (mRS score 3–6) at three months
(adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.73–1.17, P¼0.50) or
death, but was significantly associated with a higherrisk of sICH (adjusted OR 1.68, 95% CI: 1.21–2.36,
P¼0.002). Compared with other patients, those with
a platelet count below 100 /C210
9/L more often had poor
outcome (59.1% vs. 43.1%, P¼0.03), but this associ-
ation did not reach significance in a multivariable anal-ysis (adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI: 0.82–3.24, P¼0.16).
Similar point estimates were observed for death
(adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.66–3.07, P¼0.37) and
sICH (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% CI: 0.49–5.21, P¼0.43).
Patients with unknown platelet count before initiation
of IVT. In our review of the literature, excluding case
series, we found that, among 12,701 patients treatedwith alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke, a total of 66
(0.5%) patients had a platelet count below 100 /C210
9/L,
of which 4 had sICH (incidence rate 6.1%, 95% CI:2.4–14.6).
142,157,186–189Amongst patients with <100/C2
109platelets/L in the study by Gensicke et al.,
median platelet count was 90 /C2109/L (IQR 71–96).157
Other observational studies have indicated that the
proportion of stroke patients with a platelet count
<100/C2109/L is below 0.5%.190,191It is therefore
likely that the benefit of earlier IVT would outweighthe harm of bleeding from inadvertently treating
patients with a low platelet count.

PICO 13.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have a history of recent trauma, surgery, orbiopsy, does IVT with alteplase lead to better functionaloutcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Significant trauma
within the last three months is a contraindication forIVT with alteplase according to the Europeanlicense.
192The outcome of IVT in patients with this
contraindication has been reported in small case
series.193,194A relatively high number of patients had
serious intracranial or systemic haemorrhage, althoughthere is a possibility of publication bias.
Major surgery, which can be defined as surgery of
the abdomen, chest, skull or well-vascularized tissues
or of any large artery,
195has also been an exclusion
criteria in all RCTs if performed within 14 daysbefore stroke onset and is therefore also listed as acontraindication on the drug label. Among 4,848patients treated with alteplase in the TelemedicalProject for Integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) registry,
49 and 85 patients had undergone surgery within the 10
and 11–90 days preceding stroke onset, respectively.
195
In 86 (64%) patients, surgery was classified as majorand in 48 (36%) as minor. A total of 9 (7%) patientsdeveloped surgical site haemorrhage after IVT, moreoften after recent than after non-recent surgery. sICH
occurred in 9.7% of patients. No information on three-
month functional outcome was provided. Other smallobservational studies of patients treated with alteplasein spite of recent surgery also suggest that surgical sitehaemorrhage is the main hazard, without evidence ofpoor neurological outcome.

PICO 13.3 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have a history of intracranial haemorrhage, does
IVT with alteplase lead to better functional outcome than noIVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients with history of
ICH were excluded from RCTs of IVT with alteplase,
and our literature search identified very few observa-tional studies on this topic. In one observational studyof 1,212 patients treated with alteplase, only 7 (0.6%)had a history of ICH (hematoma volume: 1–21 cm,
3
elapsed time between previous ICH and ischemicstroke: 1.5–12 years), none of whom developed sICHor died after IVT.
197There are also case
reports.189,196,198A key question is the time elapsed
since the intracranial haemorrhage, but unfortunately
this information is not provided in most reports.
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, and a history of intracranial haemor-rhage, there is insufficient evidence to make an
evidence-based recommendation. Please see the

Expert consensus statement
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration and with a history of intracranial haemor-
rhage, 8 of 9 members suggest intravenous throm-bolysis with alteplase in selected cases. For exam-
ple, intravenous thrombolysis may be considered if
a long time has elapsed since the haemorrhage, or ifthere was a non-recurrent or treated underlying
cause for the haemorrhage (e.g. trauma, subarach-
noid haemorrhage with subsequent endovascularor surgical aneurysm removal, or use of specific
antithrombotic medication).PICO 13.4 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have cerebral microbleeds, does IVT with
alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Most patients enrolled
in the RCTs of IVT did not undergo MRI before ran-domisation and therefore their cerebral microbleed
(CMB) burden is unknown. In a meta-analysis of 9
observational studies, CMB was observed on pre-treatment MRI in 581 (23.4%) patients, and was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of sICH (RR 2.36, 95%
CI: 1.21–4.61, P¼0.01; I
2¼46%), but the incidence
rate of sICH remained relatively low (6.5%, 95% CI:
4.8–8.9 in patients with /C211 CMB, and 4.4%, 95% CI:
3.5–5.4% in patients without CMB).199However, in
the very small subgroup of 15 patients (0.8%) with
more than 10 CMBs, the incidence rate of sICH was
46.9% (95% CI: 22.8–72.5). In an individual partici-pant data meta-analysis of 1973 patients, presence of
/C211 and>10 CMBs were observed in 526 (26.7%) and
35 (1.8%) patients, respectively.
200The association
between CMB presence and sICH did not reach statis-
tical significance (adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.86–
2.35, P¼0,17), but a count of more than 10 CMBs
was associated with sICH (adjusted OR 3.65, 95%
CI: 1.17–11.42), remote parenchymal haemorrhage
(adjusted OR 9.09, 95% CI: 3.25–25.40) and poor func-
tional outcome (adjusted OR 3.99, 95% CI: 1.55–
10.22). Increasing CMB burden, defined as a continu-ous variable, was also independently associated with
both sICH and poor functional outcome (mRS score
>2) at three months.

Additional information. Susceptibility-weighted
imaging (SWI) is more sensitive than T2* for detectingcerebral microbleeds.
201Therefore, it is not certain how
generalisable recommendations based on T2* detected
microbleeds are to SWI detected microbleeds, notablyregarding the threshold that should be used to define
high microbleed burden. However, a systematic reviewBerge et al. XXXVII
and individual participant data meta-analysis did not
find that the type of MRI sequence (SWI vs. T2*) wasassociated with the risk of sICH following IVT
(P¼0.74 for the whole sample; P¼0.34 in the sub-
group of patients with at least one microbleed).
199
A recent study devised a multistep algorithm to
model three-month mRS scores in patients with /C2010
versus >10 CMBs who do or do not receive IVT.202
Parameters were extracted from recently published
meta-analyses and included pairwise relationshipsbetween CMBs. IVT in patients with >10 CMBs sig-
nificantly increased the odds of mortality, while the
beneficial treatment effect of IVT on clinical outcomewas attenuated in patients with >10 CMBs as com-
pared with patients with /C2010 CMBs. However, because
the general pretest probability of >10 CMBs is low
(0.6%–2.7%), the authors hypothesized that pretreat-
ment MRI to quantify CMB burden would be justified
only if it delayed IVT by <10 min.
Expert consensus statement
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke within
4.5 h of stroke onset, 9 of 9 members suggest
against systematic screening with MRI to assess
cerebral microbleed burden before making a treat-ment decision regarding intravenous thrombolysis.
PICO 13.5 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have cerebral white matter lesions, does IVT with
alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. In IST-3 there was no
evidence for heterogeneity of treatment effect regarding
good functional outcome between patients with and
without white matter lesions ( Pfor inter-
action ¼0.24).
100However, in an analysis of patients
enrolled in 4 RCTs (IST-3, NINDS, ECASS-1,ECASS-2; n¼2234), IVT with alteplase was associated
with a higher incidence rate of sICH in patients with
white matter lesions (7.9%, 95% CI: 6.4–9.6) than in
patients without (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.8–2.2; Table 11).Still, IVT was associated with a lower risk of poorfunctional outcome in patients with white matterlesions, compared with no IVT (OR 0.75, 95% CI:0.60–0.95, P¼0.015; I
2¼23%).203
In a study-level meta-analysis of observational data
from 5910 patients treated with alteplase, presence ofwhite matter lesions on CT was associated with sICH
(OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.17–2.06, P¼0.002; 7 studies;

PICO 13.6 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h

Analysis of current evidence. The discovery of unrup-
tured aneurysms in the acute phase of stroke is becom-ing more frequent with the increasing use of cerebralartery imaging. Data on IVT in patients with unrup-tured aneurysms is scarce. In a systematic review and
meta-analysis of observational data, the incidence of
sICH among 120 patients treated with alteplase foracute ischaemic stroke and having unruptured intracra-nial aneurysms was 6.7% (95% CI: 3.1–13.7%).
207The
mean maximum diameter of the aneurysms was 4.3 /C6
2.7 mm. The risk of sICH did not significantly differbetween patients with and without unrupturedaneurysms (RR 1.60; 95% CI: 0.54–4.77, P¼0.40;

PICO 14.1 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have a history of ischaemic stroke during the last
three months, does IVT with alteplase lead to better functional
outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Patients with co-
existing conditions thought to increase the risk of
sICH or worse outcome were excluded from the
RCTs of IVT with alteplase. One such example is ‘his-
tory of ischaemic stroke during the last three months’,
which was also used as an exclusion criterion in trials of
alteplase for acute myocardial infarction.122In an
observational study of alteplase for acute ischaemic
stroke, 14(1.5%) of 946 patients had had a prior
stroke within three months.146The risk of poor out-
come (mRS 3–6 at three months) was non-
significantly increased in these patients (adjusted OR
4.07, 95% CI: 0.97–17.1). In an analysis of the SITS-
EAST registry, 249(2%) of 13,007 patients had a stroke
in the preceding three months, but it was not indepen-
dently associated with poor functional outcome defined
as an mRS score 3–6 at three months (adjusted OR
0.74, 95% CI: 0.35–1.56) or sICH (adjusted OR 0.74,
95% CI: 0.35–1.56).208Other observational studies
have shown similar results.196,209–211In addition, a
large study using administrative data from 36,599
patients treated with alteplase found that ischaemic
stroke during the last three months was not associated
with an increased risk of ICH (adjusted OR 0.9, 95%
CI: 0.6–1.4, P¼0.62), but was related to an increased
risk of death (OR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2–1.9, P¼0.001) and
unfavourable discharge disposition (OR 1.3, 95% CI:
1.0–1.7, P¼0.04).212Finally, a meta-analysis of obser-
vational studies including 52,631 patients treated with
alteplase found no evidence of increased risk of sICH,
death or poor functional outcome or mortality in the1.7% of patients who had a history of ischaemic stroke

Additional information. These observational studies
have a number of limitations. Relatively few patientshad had an ischaemic stroke within the previousthree months, and many studies did not provide data
on the baseline characteristics of these patients.
Importantly, most studies did not report the timesince the previous ischaemic stroke, precluding defini-tive conclusions about the minimal time interval thatshould be respected before using IVT in such patients.

lier, or good clinical recovery.
PICO 14.2 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who had a seizure at time of stroke onset, does IVTwith alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. A seizure can be the
initial manifestation of a stroke, but patients with seiz-ures at the time of stroke have been excluded from theRCTs of IVT, for several reasons. First, post-ictal statecan mimic a stroke. Second, seizures can also be caused
by conditions other than stroke, like structural brain
lesions or metabolic/infectious states. Third, a seizurecan lead to – sometimes unobserved – head trauma thatmay increase the risk of secondary ICH.
Data from several observational studies suggests
that the risk of sICH is low in patients with strokemimics
214,215and also in patients with suspected acute
ischaemic stroke with seizure at stroke onset.216In an
observational study of 5,581 patients treated with alte-plase, 100 patients had stroke mimics (1.8%). The rate
of sICH in patients with stroke mimics was 1.0% (95%
CI: 0.0–5.0) compared with 7.9% (95% CI: 7.2–8.7) inpatients with ischaemic strokes.
214Analysis of datafrom stroke registries have also provided reassurance
that inadvertent administration of alteplase to patientswith seizures at onset of stroke-like symptoms does notincrease the risk of sICH.
214However, the possibility of
a head trauma as a consequence of the seizure must
always be considered.
Recommendation
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration who have seizures at time of stroke onset,
and for whom there is no suspicion of a strokemimic or significant head trauma, we suggest intra-
venous thrombolysis with alteplase.

Additional information. Advanced imaging methods
like MRI with DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) sequences and perfusion CT although not usedin RCTs may be useful to distinguish between post-
ictal deficits and stroke.
217,218Seizures may be associ-
ated with transient peri-ictal MRI abnormalities: a) dif-fusion abnormalities with mixed appearance withsimultaneous acute cytotoxic cortical oedema andvasogenic subcortical oedema without a vascular terri-tory lesion distribution; b) gyral enhancement occur-ring earlier than expected for acute ischemic stroke,
c) perfusion studies with normal or increased cerebral
blood volume (hyperperfusion) at the epileptogenicarea during the ictal phase and hypoperfusion in thepostictal phase.
PICO 14.3 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have dissection in the aortic arch, in a carotidartery or in an intracerebral artery, does IVT with alteplase leadto better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Most cases of aortic
arch dissection receiving IVT with alteplase are patientswith acute myocardial infarction. Some of thesepatients have suffered extension of dissection into thepericardium, leading to cardiac tamponade anddeath.
219There are only anecdotal case reports in the
literature of patients with acute ischaemic stroke who
had an aortic arch dissection and were treated with
alteplase. Reported complications include cardiac tam-ponade and intrapleural haemorrhage.
220,221IVT in
these patients could also reduce the possibility of sur-vival by leading to the postponement of an emergencyoperation to treat thoracic aortic dissection.
222
Extracranial artery dissection was a not specific
exclusion criterion in RCTs of IVT versus placebo,but because dissection is a rare event the number ofXL European Stroke Journal 6(1)
randomised patients is likely to be very low and no
specific subgroup analysis has been published. Fewobservational studies provide a direct comparison ofIVT versus no IVT in patients with artery dissection.The Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic StrokePatients (CADISP) group published an observationalstudy of 616 patients with extracranial artery dissec-tion, of which 68 (11.0%) received alteplase (81%treated with IVT and 19% with intra-arterial alte-plase).
223After adjustment for stroke severity and
large vessel occlusion status, the likelihood of goodoutcome (mRS 0–2) did not differ between patientstreated with alteplase and controls (adjusted OR 0.95,95% CI: 0.45–2.00). ICH occurred in 4 (5.9%) of thepatients who received alteplase (all of which wereasymptomatic) and 3 (0.6%) of patients who did notreceive alteplase (two of which were asymptomatic). Ina small single-centre study of 46 patients with ischae-mic stroke due to artery dissection, of which 19 (41%)were treated with IVT, the proportion of good outcome(mRS 0–2) did not significantly differ between patientstreated with or without IVT (95% vs. 82%; adjustedOR 5.49; 95% CI: 0.77–39.11).
224In an unpublished
subgroup analysis ( n¼49) of patients with dissection
and internal carotid occlusion from the Systemicthrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic strokeand Internal Carotid ARtery Occlusion (ICARO)observational study,
225IVT ( n¼26) was not signifi-
cantly associated with excellent (mRS score 0–1) orgood (mRS score 0–2) outcome compared with noIVT (unadjusted ORs 2.11, 95% CI: 0.54–8.25 and1.96, 95% CI: 0.60–6.35, respectively).
Other observational studies provide a comparison of
IVT-treated patients with and without dissection. Anindividual participant data meta-analysis of observa-tional studies including 180 patients with cervicalcarotid artery dissection indicated that case fatality atthree months and risk of sICH was similar in patientswith dissection and matched controls (fatality rate7.3%, 95% CI: 3.7–13.9% vs. 8.8%, 95% CI: 5.1–14.5%, and sICH rate 3.3% 95% CI: 1.2–8.5% vs.rate 5.9% 95% CI: 3.0–10.9%).
226Similar findings
were reported in a meta-analysis of 234 patients withco-existent extra- or intracranial dissections whoreceived alteplase.
227The respective rates of sICH
and death were 2% (0–5%) and 4% (0–8%), under-scoring the safety of alteplase in dissection-relatedacute ischaemic stroke.
The quality of evidence for IVT in patients with iso-
lated cervical artery dissection was rated as low becausealthough extracranial dissection was not a formalexclusion criterion in pivotal RCTs, direct comparisonof IVT vs. no IVT in this population relies only onobservational studies with important risk of selection
bias and confounding by indication. We decided not to
perform a meta-analysis of these studies due to notable
differences in study design.

PICO 14.4 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have had myocardial infarction during the last

outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Myocardial infarction
during the last three months was not an exclusion cri-
terion in the completed RCTs, so the results from these
trials apply to these patients.
However, there are case reports describing myocar-
dial rupture, cardiac tamponade or embolisation of
ventricular thrombus after IVT for acute ischaemicBerge et al. XLI
stroke in patients who have had a recent acute myocar-
dial infarction.229–231Conversely, other case reports
describe successful administration of IVT with alte-
plase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and
recent myocardial infarction. In a systematic review
of case series that included 102 patients, four (8.5%)
of the 47 IVT-treated patients died from confirmed orpresumed cardiac rupture/tamponade, all with sub-
acute ( >6 h) ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction
(STEMI) in the week preceding stroke.
232This compli-
cation occurred in 1 (1.8%) patients in the non-treated
group ( P¼0.18). No non-STEMI patients receiving
IVT with alteplase had cardiac complications.
Non-STEMI patients have a lower risk of complica-
tions than transmural STEMI patients, and among ST-
elevation infarctions, infarctions in the anterior wall
have the highest cardiac complication rates.233
Cardiac complications tend to peak 2–14 days aftermyocardial infarction.

Additional information. IVT with alteplase at a dose
of 1.1 mg/kg is indicated in patients with acute ( <6h )
myocardial infarction. Consequently, in the uncom-
mon case scenario of an acute ischaemic stroke com-
plicating an acute myocardial infarction alteplase may
be administered if there are no other contraindications
to IVT. The dose and the time window should conform
to the recommendations of IVT for acute ischaemic
stroke to minimize the risk of sICH.Mechanical thrombectomy may be a therapeutic
alternative to bridging therapy in patients with large-
vessel occlusion and recent myocardial infarction.
Expert consensus statement
For patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration and with history of ST-elevation myocar-dial infarction of more than a week to
three months, nine of nine group members suggest
IVT with alteplase in specific situations. Variablesto take into account are the size of the myocardial
infarction, whether recanalisation therapy was
given for the myocardial infarction, and echocar-diographic findings.
PICO 14.5 In patients with acute ischaemic stroke of <4.5 h
duration, who have infective endocarditis, does IVT with
alteplase lead to better functional outcome than no IVT?
Analysis of current evidence. Stroke is the most
common neurological complication of infective endo-
carditis, affecting up to 35% of all patients.
235
Histopathological studies also suggest that cerebral
infarcts caused by septic emboli are particularly
prone to haemorrhagic transformation as a result of
septic arteritis with erosion of the arterial wall in the
recipient vessel, with or without the formation of
mycotic aneurysms.236Consequently, there are theoret-
ical reasons to expect that IVT for acute ischaemic
stroke due to infective endocarditis will be associated
with a higher risk of sICH.222In a large study based on
administrative data, the outcome of patients treated
with IVT for acute ischaemic stroke with ( n¼222)
and without ( n¼134,048) infective endocarditis was
compared. The rate of post-thrombolytic ICH was sig-
nificantly higher in patients with infective endocarditis
than in those without (20% versus 6.5%, P¼0.006),
and the proportion of patients with discharge disposi-
tion of home/self-care was significantly lower in the
infective endocarditis group (10% versus 37%,
P¼0.01).237Some studies have also shown that alte-
plase in patients with co-existing infective endocarditis
may be complicated with multifocal ICH.238,239

Discussion
This guideline document was developed following the
GRADE methodology and aims to assist physicians indecision-making regarding IVT for acute ischaemic
stroke. It includes up-to-date scientific evidence that
supersedes the previously published ESO guidelinesand Karolinska Stroke Update recommendations.
1,240
All recommendations and Expert consensus statementsare summarized in Table 12.
Whenever possible, we based our recommendations
on RCTs or individual participant data meta-analysesof RCTs rather than observational studies, which aremore prone to selection bias and confounding. Wefound that there is high quality evidence for recommen-dations on time to treatment, patients with different
ages and stroke severity, based on individual partici-
pant data analyses of all trials of IVT with alteplase todate.
We decided to provide separate recommendations
for patients with unknown symptom onset and patients
with known stroke onset of more than 4.5 hrs, because
we believe that they correspond to two distinct clinicalscenarios. Indeed, many patients with wake-up strokemay have a ‘true’ stroke onset of <4.5 hrs.
31,32
Therefore, from a pathophysiological standpoint, this
situation notably differs from strokes of more than
4.5hrs’ duration. Furthermore, in our experience the
information on whether the symptom onset is knownor unknown is generally available when the patientarrives in the hospital. Based on the result of an indi-vidual participant data meta-analysis of RCTs,
46we
recommend IVT in patients with unknown stroke
onset selected with advanced imaging (DWI-FLAIR
mismatch or core/perfusion mismatch). An extensionof the time window beyond 4.5 h of known onset timeis also possible if perfusion-diffusion MRI or CT per-fusion shows potentially salvageable brain tissue.However, urgent advanced brain imaging is not
always available, which may limit the immediate appli-
cability of these recommendations. Moreover, therecent trials on the extended time window –EXTENDand ECASS-4– excluded patients for whom mechanicalthrombectomy was planned, which may further reduce
the number of patients qualifying of IVT beyond 4.5 h.
Although there are several high-quality trials to guidepractice, 29 out of 40 recommendations are based onlow or very low quality of evidence. These recommen-dations came from meta-analyses of small trials, singlemodest-sized randomised trials, or observational stud-
ies. Although tenecteplase has a number of potential
advantages, it is remains uncertain whether it is non-inferior to alteplase for all patients with acute ischae-mic stroke. Still, we found low quality evidence tosuggest tenecteplase over alteplase in patients with
large vessel occlusion who are candidates for mechan-ical thrombectomy.
The strengths of this guideline are its systematic
approach to searching the literature and guidance bythe GRADE recommendations. However, many ques-tions posed to the guideline module working groupwere about particular subgroups of patients with dif-
ferent clinical characteristics, or who were taking par-
ticular drugs at baseline. In many of these patientsthere are clinical uncertainties about the balance ofbenefit and harm of IVT. However, in the absence ofstudies randomly allocating participants in these sub-groups to IVT or control, the precise effects of treat-ments are unknown. It would be a mistake to interpreta modestly higher risk of post-IVT sICH as a reason
not to treat such patients, because the benefit of alte-
plase has not been similarly quantified. Therefore, foralmost all patients the best prediction of effect of IVT isthat of the average patient treated at that time point ina randomised trial rather than patient with very similarcharacteristics from an observational study. However,for practical reasons not all remaining questionsregarding IVT can be answered by RCTs. Multicentre
registries offer observational evidence that could con-
tribute to our knowledge on IVT, particular when theyare representative of all treated patients.
To support physicians in their practical decision-
making, expert consensus statements are given in a
dedicated paragraph. Whenever appropriate, theseopinions were systematically collected as polls. Aboutthree out of four of these polls (13/17) led to a goodagreement of 7–9 of the 9 group members. In theremaining questions, the group members’ opinionsvaried considerably. The recommendations with verylow evidence and poor agreement among experts were
on the subjects of IVT before thrombectomy in wake-
up stroke or ischaemic stroke of 4.5–9 h duration, espe-cially in those patients directly admitted to athrombectomy-capable centre.
A next priority of research into thrombolysis is how
to implement it widely in populations with the greatestneed – that is patients in those areas with the higheststroke incidence and lowest use of thrombolysis. Thiswill need methods to make decisions about IVT asrapid and as simple as possible and remove certain bar-riers related to initial exclusion criteria that are not sup-ported by current randomised or observational evidence.Implementation studies, training, further improvement
in safety of IVT, reducing the cost of thrombolytics and
resource allocation to stroke in the areas of Europe withthe highest stroke incidence are most likely to give thegreatest return on investment.Berge et al. XLIII

Plain language summary
Patients with stroke due to blood clots in brain arteries
(‘ischaemic stroke’) can be treated with clot-dissolving
drugs called ‘thrombolytics’. By dissolving blood clots,thrombolytic drugs improve brain blood supply and
lead to better recovery. However, thrombolytic drugs
may cause bleeding in the brain which can lead to
worse disability or death. The most commonly used
thrombolytic drug for ischemic stroke is called alte-
plase. The guideline authors make recommendations
about the use of thrombolytic drugs given into a veinfor patients with acute ischaemic stroke.
The guideline makes forty recommendations. The
most important recommendations are:
1. To treat ischaemic stroke patients with alteplase if it
can be started within 4.5 h of symptoms beginning.
The stroke symptoms should be disabling at the time
of treatment. The age of the patient does not matter.
2. Advanced brain imaging (magnetic resonance or CT
perfusion) should be used to select patients for treat-ment with alteplase, if they present between 4.5 and
9 h after the start of symptoms, or if a stroke is
noticed at waking from sleep.
3. To avoid treatment with low dose alteplase, or to
add ultrasound or immediate antiplatelet drugs to
alteplase because they do not give a better chance
of surviving with no disability.
4. If an ischaemic stroke patient could be treated with
alteplase, do not avoid treatment if the patient:
has a diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes,
previous stroke, or a heart attack
takes antiplatelet drugs like aspirin
At the time of stroke has a high blood glucose
level, or an epileptic seizure (if the diagnosis ofstroke is certain) or dissection of the carotid
artery
Has had a brain scan that shows a brain
aneurysm that has not burst, or <10 tiny brainbleeds (microbleeds), or damage to the brain
‘white matter’
has had a brain bleed because of a cause unlikely
to re-occur
5. Generally, to avoid treatment with alteplase if the
ischaemic patient is taking blood thinning drugs
such as a ‘direct oral anticoagulants’ or warfarin,unless:
The patient is taking warfarin and the INR (a
measure of blood clotting) is known to be <1.7.
The patient had been prescribed a ‘direct oral
anticoagulant’ (such as apixaban, dabigatran,rivaroxaban, edoxaban) but has not taken thedrug in the 48 h before stroke.
6. Generally to avoid treatment with alteplase if the
patient has recently had major surgery, major
trauma, infection of the heart valves (endocarditis),
or dissection of the aorta. If the patient is known tohave more than ten tiny bleeds of the brain (micro-bleeds) or very low levels of blood platelets, treat-ment should be avoided, but looking for these withblood tests or extra brain scans should not delaytreatment.
7. An alternative thrombolytic drug, tenecteplase, may
be favored over alteplase before clot pulling treat-ment (thrombectomy), but its place to treat allpatients is uncertain.
8. Once blood pressure is lower than 185 mmHg sys-
tolic or 110 mmHg diastolic, alteplase can be givensafely.
The major recommendations were supported by
high to moderate quality evidence. Other than for age
and stroke severity, there was weaker evidence to sup-port when to use alteplase in very particular situations.
