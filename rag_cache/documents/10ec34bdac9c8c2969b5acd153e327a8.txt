Abstract: (1) Background: Previous studies have proven a high incidence of a femoro-acetabular
impingement (FAI) type cam in patients sustaining a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Thus,
the current study analyzed, if a cam deformity is predictable after SCFE treatment; (2) Methods:
113 cases of SCFE were treated between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2017. The radiological
assessment included the slip angle after surgery (referenced to the femoral neck (epiphyseal tilt) and
shaft axis as Southwick angle) and the last available lateral center edge angle (LCEA), the acetabular-
and alpha angle. A correlation was performed between these parameters and the last alpha angle
to predict a FAI type cam; (3) Results: After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years ( 1.9; 2.0–11.2), 48.5%
of the patients showed a FAI type cam and 43.2% a dysplasia on the affected side. The correlation
between the epiphyseal tilt and alpha angle was statically signiﬁcant ( p= 0.017) with a medium
effect size of 0.28 ; (4) Conclusions: The postoperative posterior epiphyseal tilt was predictive factor
to determine the alpha angle. However, the cut-off value of the slip angle was 16.8for a later
occurrence of a FAI type cam indicating a small range of acceptable deviations from the anatomical
position for SCFE reconstruction.

1. Introduction
The slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a hip disorder in the immature skeleton
with an incidence between 0.33–24.85/100,000 [ 1]. In most cases the capital femoral epiph-
ysis slides from the metaphysis in a medial-posterior direction (varus), but lateral-posterior
displacements (valgus) are also described [ 2]. While an atypical type is caused by a known
trigger including endocrine disorders, renal osteodystrophy or radiation treatment, the
majority is idiopathic and only associated with general risk factors, especially obesity [3,4] .
The affected children are on average between 11.7–13.0 years of age in dependence of the
gender, causing females to usually sustain earlier a SCFE [ 5]. The disease occurs bilaterally
in up to 80.0%, therefore the unaffected side can be treated in a prophylactic attempt [ 6].
The surgical procedures for the SCFE range from a closed reduction and internal ﬁxation
with wires or screws to open treatment options with osteotomies [ 7]. Independent of the
chosen procedure, the overall aim is to restore and stabilize the anatomical position of the
capital femoral epiphysis as close to natural as possible to achieve a physiological femoral
neck junction and reduce the risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head. A remaining
incongruence and a remodeling process after the slip and the following treatment may
cause a femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) type cam in the early adolescence. The FAI
was ﬁrstly described by Ganz et al. and represents a bony conﬂict between the acetabular
rim and the femoral head-neck junction [ 8]. Generally, three types were differentiated. The
FAI type pincer is deﬁned as a local or general overcoverage of the femoral head due to

prominence of the acetabular rim (for example in case of a retroversion, coxa profunda).
The femoral deformity, the most common type, is described as FAI type cam and represents
a bone thickening at the femoral head-neck junction leading to a mechanical conﬂict. The
third type is a mixed type combining an acetabular and femoral deformity [ 9]. On the
one hand the severity of the displacement (moderate, mild, severe) correlates with the
rate of a FAI development, on the other hand a post-slip remodeling might inﬂuence the
remaining femoral neck deformity [ 10,11]. According to this, the rate of the occurrence of a
post-slip FAI was less common in patients younger than 11 years and might be explained
by an extended time period of remodeling potential [ 12]. The FAI type cam is deﬁned with
an elevated alpha angle >55.0(physiological range < 55.0), which represents an angle
between the femoral neck axis and a line connecting the center of the femoral head and the
point of the bony head contour with a greater distance to the center than the radius [ 13].
Overall, the rate of FAI associated hip osteoarthritis was described with up to 91.0% in
SCFE patients, compared to 43.0% in non-SCFE patients [ 10]. Fraitzl et al. reviewed 16 mild
SCFE patients and observed a rate of elevated values of the alpha angle in all cases ranging
from 55 to 99[14]. The local bony thickening at the femoral neck leads to groin pain by
damaging the acetabular labrum and the cartilage [ 15–17]. If left untreated, a FAI type
cam might be responsible for an early onset osteoarthritis of the hip [ 18]. With a reshaping
procedure of the femoral neck junction in an arthroscopic, arthroscopically-assisted or open
setting, the progression of the joint degeneration may be prolongated and the total hip
arthroplasty (THA)—free life time enhanced [ 19]. Hence, it is important to know which
patients with a SCFE in their history are predestinated to develop a FAI type cam. With
this information, the care of high-risk patients can be scheduled regularly over years to
detect a symptomatic bony bump in an early stage. Further, in previous literature also
an association between a SCFE and the development of a dysplastic socket shape and
otherwise severe slips and a coxa profunda was observed [20,21].
Thus, the ﬁrst aim was to detect the prevalence of pathological hip anatomies after
SCFE (1). Another aim of this study was to analyze predictive factors in patients with a
SCFE that may cause development of a FAI type cam over time (2).
2. Materials and Methods
This retrospective study was approved by the local ethic committee (No. 8779,
Hanover Medical School, 28 November 2019). The inclusion criterium was a surgical
treatment of a SCFE between 1 January 2005–31 December 2017 in our clinic (Department
of Orthopaedic Surgery at Diakovere Annastift, Hannover Medical School) and included
113 cases in 111 patients. Exclusion criteria were missing radiological follow-up exam-
ination (e.g., due to outside follow-up examinations) or disapproval for participation.
According to this, 18 cases (15.9%) resp. 15 patients (3 patients with a bilateral SCFE,
12 patients with a unilateral SCFE) were excluded from the study due to missing follow-up
radiographs (at least two years) for the analysis of FAI type cam predicting factors. All
patients were treated either with wires or with screws. The diagnosis was made with a
radiological examination in two planes, pelvic anterior-posterior (a.p., standardized in
supine position) and lateral views on both sides. All patients received postoperative phys-
iotherapy training, including unloading or partial weight bearing for 6 weeks, depending
on the patient’s age, weight and compliance.
The radiological analysis directly after surgical ﬁxation included the lateral center edge
angle according to the sourcil method (LCEA) [ 22] and the acetabular angle (inclination) to
evaluate the femoral coverage [ 23], especially regarding the presence of a hip dysplasia
or coxa profunda, as well as the absolute slip angle according to Southwick [ 24,25]. The
grading of the Southwick angle values is typically: mild (<30), moderate (30–50) and
severe (>50). Because the alpha angle is referenced to the femoral neck axis, this reference
was the same for the posterior epiphyseal tilt to predict a FAI type cam over the time [ 26].
In contrast to the Southwick angle, which is determined as an angle between the slipped
capital epiphysis and the femoral shaft axis, the posterior epiphyseal tilt was referenced

also to the femoral neck axis like the alpha angle [ 27]. In addition, parameters for dysplasia
resp. retroversion were evaluated, including the crossover sign (the anterior and posterior
acetabular rims crossing on the pelvic a.p.) and the prominence of the ischial spine (PRISS;
the ischial spine is projected in the lesser pelvic on the pelvic a.p.) [ 28]. In presence of a
crossover sign and a positive PRISS a retroversion was assumed, whereas a dysplasia was
deﬁned with a LCEA <20 and an inclination >10. All the described values were assessed
again at the last time of the radiological follow-up, additionally the alpha angle [ 13]. In
presence of a SCFE, the center of the femoral head is not always aligned to the axis of the
femoral neck for measurement of the alpha angle and the posterior epiphyseal tilt. To avoid
inaccuracy, the anatomical method according to Bouma et al. was used [ 29]. For this, the
femoral neck axis was deﬁned with three circles along the femoral neck, whichever ﬁtted
the bony neck best (Figures 1 and 2).

 The grading of the Southwick angle values is typically: mild (<30°), moderate (30–50°) and 
severe (>50°). Because the alpha angle is referenced to the femoral neck axis, this reference 
was the same for the posterior epiphyseal tilt to predict a FAI type cam over the time [26]. 
In contrast to the Southwick angle, which is  determined as an angle between the slipped 
capital epiphysis and the femoral shaft axis, th e posterior epiphyseal tilt was referenced 
also to the femoral neck axis like the alpha angle [27]. In addition, parameters for dysplasia 
resp. retroversion were evaluated, including th e crossover sign (the anterior and posterior 
acetabular rims crossing on the pelvic a.p.) and the prominence of the ischial spine (PRISS; 
the ischial spine is projected in the lesser pelvic on the pelvic a.p.) [28]. In presence of a crossover sign and a positive PRISS a retrov ersion was assumed, whereas a dysplasia was 
defined with a LCEA < 20 and an inclination > 10°. All the described values were assessed 
again at the last time of the radiological follow-up, additionally the alpha angle [13]. In presence of a SCFE, the center of the femoral he ad is not always aligned to the axis of the 
femoral neck for measurement of the alpha an gle and the posterior epiphyseal tilt. To 
avoid inaccuracy, the anatomical method according to Bouma et al. was used [29]. For 
this, the femoral neck axis was defined with three circles along the femoral neck, which-
ever fitted the bony neck best (Figures 1 and 2).  
The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 
After the descriptive analysis , an unpaired t-test was used for comparisons between the 
affected and the unaffected hip. To analyze th e predictive impact of the postoperative slip 
angle and the posterior epiphyseal tilt on the alpha angle at the last time of follow-up, a 
linear regression was performed. The (Pearson ) r describes the correlation between both 
values, which was categorized according to Cohen: 0–0.3 small; 0.3–0.8 medium; >0.8 
strong correlation [30].

3. Results 
From the 95 remaining cases, 91 children (97. 8%; 41 right side/ 50 left side) sustain an 
unilateral and 2 (2.2%) showed bilateral SCFE at time of diagnosis. The total group in-
cluded 46 boys (49.5%) and 47 girls (50.5%) with a mean age of 12.8 years (±2.2; 8.9–16.9) and a mean body mass index (BMI) 26.5 kg/m
2 (±4.2; 20.4–33.3).  
The direct postoperative anatomy of the hi p socket on the affected side was 29.6° 
(±6.8; 12.1–47.8) for the LCEA and 8.7° (±4.0; 1.2–20.0) for the acetabular angle. 37 patients 
(38.9%) presented dysplastic values for at least the LCEA, the acetabular angle or both. 
Further, radiological signs of a hip retroversi on were in 21 cases (22.1%) a positive cross-
over and in 16 cases (16.8%) a present PRISS. On the unaffected side, 18 patients (18.9%) 
showed a hip dysplasia with an overall LCEA of 30.0° (± 6.4; 17.0–46.8) and a mean ace-
tabular angle of 7.4 (±3.8; 0.5–22.4). The mean radiological follow-up of the 95 cases was 
4.3 years (±1.9; 2.0–11.2), resulting in a mean age of approximately 17.0 years (±2.6; 11.1–
26.5). Although the hip socket was not treate d, the acetabular anatomy was measured at 
the last time of the radiological follow-up to observe the further possible changes of the 
coverage. According to that, 33 patients (34.7%) had at least one dysplastic socket angle 
on the affected side with an overall LCEA at the last examination of 27.6° (±7.9; 8.3–44.0) and an acetabular angle of 8.0° (±4.4; 0.1–20.3). From these patients, 21 (63.6%) showed 
already direct postoperatively dysplastic values. In spite of the small reduction of the ac-
etabular values, the presence of  a crossover sign increased to 53 cases (55.8%) and to 44 
cases (46.3%) with a PRISS. 15 patients (15.8%) showed a hip dysplasia on the unaffected 
side at the last time of follow-up, two less than directly after surgery. The socket anatomy was on average with a LCEA of 30.7° (±8.7; 13.2–49.9) and an acetabular angle of 6.5° (±4.0; 
0.4–19.7). The mean Southwick angle after surgery was 32.8° (±16.0; 2.3–76.1): 43 (45.3%) 
cases in a mild (0–30°) and 36 (37.9%) in a moderate (30–50°) and 16 (16.8%) in a severe 
(>50°) displaced position, whereas posterior epiphyseal tilt was 18.0° (±12.0; 1.0–49.6). At 
the last time of the radiological follow-up, the alpha angle was in 46 cases (48.4%) >60°, representing a FAI type cam. In the 93 cases with a unilateral SCFE, the alpha angle of the

3. Results
From the 95 remaining cases, 91 children (97.8%; 41 right side/ 50 left side) sustain
an unilateral and 2 (2.2%) showed bilateral SCFE at time of diagnosis. The total group
included 46 boys (49.5%) and 47 girls (50.5%) with a mean age of 12.8 years ( 2.2; 8.9–16.9)
and a mean body mass index (BMI) 26.5 kg/m2(4.2; 20.4–33.3).
The direct postoperative anatomy of the hip socket on the affected side was 29.6
(6.8; 12.1–47.8) for the LCEA and 8.7(4.0; 1.2–20.0) for the acetabular angle. 37 patients
(38.9%) presented dysplastic values for at least the LCEA, the acetabular angle or both.
Further, radiological signs of a hip retroversion were in 21 cases (22.1%) a positive crossover
and in 16 cases (16.8%) a present PRISS. On the unaffected side, 18 patients (18.9%) showed
a hip dysplasia with an overall LCEA of 30.0(6.4; 17.0–46.8) and a mean acetabular
angle of 7.4 ( 3.8; 0.5–22.4). The mean radiological follow-up of the 95 cases was 4.3 years
(1.9; 2.0–11.2), resulting in a mean age of approximately 17.0 years ( 2.6; 11.1–26.5).
Although the hip socket was not treated, the acetabular anatomy was measured at the last
time of the radiological follow-up to observe the further possible changes of the coverage.
According to that, 33 patients (34.7%) had at least one dysplastic socket angle on the
affected side with an overall LCEA at the last examination of 27.6(7.9; 8.3–44.0) and an
acetabular angle of 8.0(4.4; 0.1–20.3). From these patients, 21 (63.6%) showed already
direct postoperatively dysplastic values. In spite of the small reduction of the acetabular
values, the presence of a crossover sign increased to 53 cases (55.8%) and to 44 cases (46.3%)
with a PRISS. 15 patients (15.8%) showed a hip dysplasia on the unaffected side at the last
time of follow-up, two less than directly after surgery. The socket anatomy was on average
with a LCEA of 30.7(8.7; 13.2–49.9) and an acetabular angle of 6.5(4.0; 0.4–19.7). The
mean Southwick angle after surgery was 32.8(16.0; 2.3–76.1): 43 (45.3%) cases in a mild
(0–30) and 36 (37.9%) in a moderate (30–50) and 16 (16.8%) in a severe (>50) displaced
position, whereas posterior epiphyseal tilt was 18.0(12.0; 1.0–49.6). At the last time of
the radiological follow-up, the alpha angle was in 46 cases (48.4%) >60, representing a FAI
type cam. In the 93 cases with a unilateral SCFE, the alpha angle of the unaffected side was
about 14.4lower (50.0 10.1 vs. 64.4 17.7) compared to the diseased hip ( p= 0.001).
The correlation between the direct postoperative Southwick angle and the alpha angle
at the last time of follow-up was low ( r= 0.03; Figure 3). Due to the missing correlation, no
further observations or statistics were performed.
In contrast to that, the regression between the posterior epiphyseal tilt and the alpha
angle of the last radiograph indicated that from a posterior epiphyseal tilt above 16.8, the
estimated alpha angle over time was greater than 60. The correlation was statistically
signiﬁcant ( p= 0.017). Per 1of the postoperative posterior epiphyseal tilt, the alpha angle
increased by 6.18in the last radiological examination (Figure 4). With a r= 0.27, a small
correlation according to Cohen is present.

At the time of surgery, 8 patients (8.4%) showed a hip dysplasia on the affected side
determined by a LCEA below 20, whereas 37 patients (38.9%) had an acetabular index
above 10, including 6 patients (6.3%) with both characteristics. Compared to the unaffected
side, the hip joint with the SCFE condition showed a signiﬁcantly decreased coverage for
both parameters (Table 1). However, a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between the
severity of the SCFE and the presence of dysplastic socket angles was not observed ( p> 0.05).

4. Discussion
During childhood, the SCFE is one of the most prevalent hip disorders, and due to the
occurrence in the immature skeleton, the complications in the joint function might extend
to further life stages. In spite of an adequate reconstruction, an incongruence of the femoral
head neck junction remained in many patients [ 7]. Experience of pain and limitations in
range of movement (ROM) caused by joint impingement, might provide an indication in
performing preserving arthroscopies or open procedures. However, it is estimated that the
rate of THA after SCFE is about 22.0–45.0% in middle age [ 31,32]. Thus, the current study
analyzed the rate of hip deformities following a SCFE and predictive factors detecting
patients with a high risk for the development of a FAI over time. Further, regarding the
coverage the evidence in the international literature is limited and not consistent as ranging
from associations with dysplastic and deep sockets [20,21].
First of all, the cohort include common ﬁndings regarding the age and BMI. According
to this, the mean age was 12.8 years and in range with other population-based results
(11.7–13.0) [ 5]. Further, the mean BMI was 26.5 kg/m2and represents under recognition of
the mean age a percentile value > 95.0%, which also was observed in other studies [ 4,33].
However, the focus of this retrospective study was the anatomy of the hip socket and
the femoral head-neck junction over time after SCFE to determine the frequency of a FAI
type cam and a trend to a more retroverted and dysplastic socket shape compared to the
unaffected hip joint. The radiographs of the last examination presented an elevated alpha
angle >60in 48.4% of the cases and compared to the unaffected side, the alpha angle
was about 14.4higher at the joint side sustaining a SCFE ( p< 0.001). In addition, the
patients with an increased alpha angle (>60) at the last follow-up showed a signiﬁcant
higher perioperative posterior epiphyseal tilt (15.1 9.8 vs. 20.7 13.8; ( p< 0.01)). The
determined postoperative cut-off value for the reconstructed epiphyseal tilt resulting in
a radiological appearance of a FAI type cam (alpha angle > 60) was 16.8. Although
the correlation between both values was statistically signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05), the predictable
amount was limited with r = 0.27. However, the postoperative Southwick angle showed no
correlation to the latest alpha angle and as such did not present a predictive factor for the
occurrence of a FAI type cam over time. Similar results were found by Dodds et al. [34] .
The authors analyzed predictive factors for a cam deformity after SCFE in 46 patients.
The perioperative slip angle at r = 0.17 showed a poor correlation to the follow-up alpha
angle, so that the authors recommended to monitor all SCFE patients into adulthood
for an impingement [ 34]. Another study also demonstrated a non-signiﬁcant trend that
preoperative slip angles >35were associated with a later onset of an impingement of
the hip [ 35]. Furthermore, the a.p. alpha angle was found as predictive factor for a poor
clinical (HHS < 85 points) as well as radiological follow-up result by Terjesen et al. [ 36].
In analogy with that, a dysplastic socket anatomy was found in 8.4% with a LCEA <20
and in 38.9% with an acetabular angle >10. Furthermore, the affected hip had a decreased
coverage (LCEA/acetabular angle: 27.67.9/8.0 4.4) compared to the healthy side
(LCEA/acetabular angle: 30.78.7/6.5 4.0) (p< 0.001). In spite of statistical signiﬁ-
cance, the clinical relevance might be low, especially because both mean values represent
sufﬁcient coverage. The differences in the determined rates of a dysplastic hip anatomy in
dependence of the chosen angle, LCEA or acetabular angle, might be explained by the way

of the measurement. For the determination of the LCEA, the center of the femoral head is
required, but the displacement in case of SCFE may lead to a deformed and noncircular
shaped femoral head, resulting in an inaccuracy for the determination of the femoral head
center while LCEA measurement. Another explanation might be the chosen cut-off values.
Deﬁning a dysplastic anatomy with LCEA <25.0and an acetabular angle >12.0might
has adjusted the values. However, Maranho et al. also observed in their longitudinal study
of 108 patients a tendency to a decreased femoral head coverage of SCFE affected hips [ 20].
It is supposed, that the epiphyseal displacement might inﬂuence the physiological growth
of the acetabular socket. According to this, the remodeling after the slip might lead to a
relative overgrowth of the femoral head leading to dysplastic conditions or in presence of a
FAI the bony might impair the ossiﬁcation of the acetabular rim [ 37,38]. Otherwise, some
studies observed overcovered anatomies and deep sockets in patients with SCFE [ 39,40]. In
congruence with that, in the time period directly after surgery and to the last radiological
follow-up an increase of signs for a retroverted acetabulum was observed. According to
that, the among of positive crossover signs raised from 22.1% to 55.8% resp. for a PRISS
from 16.8% to 46.3%. In spite of a standardized supine positioning in our institute, the
pelvic tilt was not evaluated with the sacrococcygeal-symphysis distance, which might
have inﬂuenced these results. However, the association between hip pathologies and the
presence of an acetabular retroversion was observed. In comparison to the physiological
retroversion prevalence of approximately 6%, Bauer et al. found at least one sign (crossover
or PRISS) in 79–82% bilateral resp. unilateral involved SCFE hips [ 41,42]. These obser-
vations were not constantly proofed by other studies [ 43,44]. The presented results with
follow-up examinations showed a hint for a development to an acetabular retroversion
in comparison to the direct postoperative results and to the uninvolved side in unilateral
cases. However, the association between an acetabular retroversion and a SCFE needs
further studies to be proofed.
The study has some limitations. The ﬁrst aspect was the limited radiological follow-up
about 4.3 years ( 1.9; 2.0–11.2). As a result, deviations of the physiological hip anatomy
developing later in the patient’s life might not be detected in this study (information bias).
This could explain the difference in the rates of detected FAI type cam over the time,
48.4% in the current work, compared to 91.0% in candidates for THA [ 10]. However, the
mean age at time of the last radiological follow-up was approximately 17.0 years meaning
that the majority of the cohort were followed-up after skeleton maturity. In addition,
for young patients with a constant level of their known symptoms after SCFE, frequent
radiological follow-up should be carefully discussed regarding radioprotection. Thus,
there might be a lack of radiographs to show increasing disabilities between the ages of
20–35 years. Lack of radiation might also explain the usage of conventional radiographs
in the current study, although with SCFE representing a three-dimensional slip, a more
precise analysis could be performed in CT. However, the indication for a CT in young
patients should stay an exception and not be routinely performed. This work analyzed the
radiological presence of a bone thickening at the head-neck junction without information
about the clinical symptoms or functional limitations of the observed patients. Another
limitation was the observational study design resulting in associated biases. According
to this the current study has not a comparative character due to a missing patient’s group
with physiological hip conditions (selection bias) [ 45,46]. However, in the current study
the unaffected side of patients sustained from a unilateral SCFE was analyzed and worked
as comparative dataset. Another aspect of observational studies is the confounding [ 45,46].
While the association between a SCFE and a development of a FAI type cam over time
was proofed in this and previously in other studies, the associated socket morphology
is currently discussed in literature and included hints for deep as well as insufﬁcient,
dysplastic covering hips [ 20,39,40]. These inconsistent observations might be caused by a
confounding factor.

5. Conclusions
The postoperative posterior epiphyseal tilt represented a limited predictive factor
to determine the alpha angle over time in patients sustaining a SCFE. However, the cut-
off value of the epiphyseal tilt for a later occurrence of a FAI type cam was about 16.8,
indicating a small range of acceptable deviations from the anatomical position for SCFE
reconstruction. Because there are no clear predictive factors for the occurrence of an FAI, all
patients sustained from SCFE should be followed-up at least once after skeleton maturity.
