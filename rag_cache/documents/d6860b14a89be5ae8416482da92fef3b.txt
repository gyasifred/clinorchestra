AIM: The “2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure” replaces the “2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline 
for the Management of Heart Failure” and the “2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline 
for the Management of Heart Failure.” The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for 
clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure.
METHODS : A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, 
reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), 
EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. 
Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This 
guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published 
through December 2021.
STRUCTURE: Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides 
recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an 
evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with 
patients’ interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, 
and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data. Value statements are provided for certain 
treatments with high-quality published economic analyses.AHA Scientific Statements

TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES
1. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for 
heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) now includes 4 medication classes that 
include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors 
(SGL T2i).
2. SGL T2i have a Class of Recommendation 2a 
in HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction 
(HFmrEF). Weaker recommendations (Class of 
Recommendation 2b) are made for ARNi, ACEi, 
ARB, MRA, and beta blockers in this population.
3. New recommendations for HFpEF are made for 
SGL T2i (Class of Recommendation 2a), MRAs 
(Class of Recommendation 2b), and ARNi (Class 
of Recommendation 2b). Several prior recommen -
dations have been renewed including treatment of 
hypertension (Class of Recommendation 1), treat -
ment of atrial fibrillation (Class of Recommendation 
2a), use of ARBs (Class of Recommendation 2b), 
and avoidance of routine use of nitrates or phospho -
diesterase-5 inhibitors (Class of Recommendation 
3: No Benefit).
4. Improved L VEF is used to refer to those patients 
with previous HFrEF who now have an L VEF 
>40%. These patients should continue their HFrEF 
treatment.
5. Value statements were created for select rec -
ommendations where high-quality, cost-effec -
tiveness studies of the intervention have been 
published.
6. Amyloid heart disease has new recommendations 
for treatment including screening for serum and 
urine monoclonal light chains, bone scintigraphy, 
genetic sequencing, tetramer stabilizer therapy, and 
anticoagulation.
7 . Evidence supporting increased filling pressures is 
important for the diagnosis of HF if the L VEF is 
>40%. Evidence for increased filling pressures can 
be obtained from noninvasive (eg, natriuretic pep -
tide, diastolic function on imaging) or invasive test -
ing (eg, hemodynamic measurement).
8. Patients with advanced HF who wish to prolong 
survival should be referred to a team specializing 
in HF. A HF specialty team reviews HF manage -
ment, assesses suitability for advanced HF thera -
pies, and uses palliative care including palliative 
inotropes where consistent with the patient’s 
goals of care.
9. Primary prevention is important for those at risk 
for HF (stage A) or pre-HF (stage B). Stages of

with HF and iron deficiency, anemia, hypertension, 
sleep disorders, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, 
coronary artery disease, and malignancy.
PREAMBLE
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated 
scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with 
recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. 
These guidelines, which are based on systematic meth-
ods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a founda-
tion for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The 
ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication 
of clinical practice guidelines without commercial sup-
port, and members volunteer their time to the writing and 
review efforts. Guidelines are official policy of the ACC 
and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA part-
ner with other organizations.
Intended Use
Clinical practice guidelines provide recommenda-
tions applicable to patients with or at risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical 
practice in the United States, but these guidelines are rel-
evant to patients throughout the world. Although guide-
lines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, 
the intent is to improve quality of care and align with pa-
tients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define prac-
tices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, 
circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.
Clinical Implementation
Management, in accordance with guideline recommenda-
tions, is effective only when followed by both practitioners 
and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be 
enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians 
and patients, with patient engagement in selecting inter-
ventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, 
and associated conditions and comorbidities.
Methodology and Modernization
The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guide-
lines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, updates, and 
modifies guideline methodology on the basis of published 
standards from organizations, including the National Acad-
emy of Medicine (formerly, the Institute of Medicine),1,2 and 
on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, presentation 
and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified in response to evolving technologies and other factors to op-
timally facilitate dissemination of information to health care 
professionals at the point of care.
Numerous modifications to the guidelines have been 
implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user 
friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a 
modular, “knowledge chunk” format in which each chunk 
includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, rec-
ommendation-specific supportive text and, when appro-
priate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked 
references are provided for each modular knowledge 
chunk to facilitate quick access and review.In recognition 
of the importance of cost–value considerations, in certain 
guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an assessment 
of value for a drug, device, or intervention may be per-
formed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology.3
To ensure that guideline recommendations remain cur-
rent, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
the writing committee and staff. Going forward, targeted 
sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically 
after publication and timely peer review of potentially 
practice-changing science. The previous designations of 
“full revision” and “focused update” will be phased out. 
For additional information and policies on guideline devel-
opment, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guideline 
methodology manual4 and other methodology articles.5–7
Selection of Writing Committee Members
The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guide-
line writing committee contains requisite content exper-
tise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular 
community by selection of experts across a spectrum of 
backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, 
sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, 
and clinical practice settings. Organizations and profes-
sional societies with related interests and expertise are 
invited to participate as partners or collaborators.
Relationships With Industry and Other Entities
The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods 
to ensure that documents are developed without bias or 
improper influence. The complete policy on relationships 
with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. 
Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee mem-
bers’ relevant RWI; for the purposes of full transparency, 
their comprehensive disclosure information is available in 
a Supplemental Appendix. Comprehensive disclosure in-
formation for the Joint Committee is also available online.

AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guidelineall available data.4,5 Literature searches focus on ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include regis-
tries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive stud-
ies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and 
expert opinion. Only key references are cited.
An independent evidence review committee is com-
missioned when there are ≥ 1 questions deemed of 
utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic 
review to determine which patients are most likely to ben-
efit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what 
degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence review 
committee and formal systematic review include absence 
of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of 
defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent 
with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial 
number of patients, and likelihood that the findings can 
be translated into actionable recommendations. Evidence 
review committee members may include methodologists, 
epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians. Recom-
mendations developed by the writing committee on the 
basis of the systematic review are marked “SR.”
Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy
The term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) 
encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and 
both pharmacological and procedural treatments. For 
these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the 
reader should confirm dosage with product insert material 
and evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Rec-
ommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treat-
ments approved for clinical use in the United States.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review
The recommendations listed in this guideline are, 
whenever possible, evidence based. An initial exten-
sive evidence review, which included literature derived 
from research involving human subjects, published in 
English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), 
EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected 
databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted 
from May 2020 to December 2020. Key search words 
included but were not limited to the following: heart 
failure; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart failure with 
mildly reduced ejection fraction; systolic heart failure; 
heart failure rehabilitation; cardiac failure; chronic heart 
failure; acute decompensated heart failure; cardiogenic 
shock; beta blockers; mineralocorticoid receptor antag-onists; ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin and neprilysin recep-
tor antagonist; sacubitril valsartan; angiotensin receptor 
antagonist; Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 or SGLT2 
inhibitors; cardiac amyloidosis; atrial fibrillation; conges-
tive heart failure; guideline-directed medical therapy; 
HFrEF; diabetes mellitus; cardiomyopathy; cardiac 
amyloidosis; valvular heart disease; mitral regurgitation; 
cardiomyopathy in pregnancy; reduced ejection fraction; 
right heart pressure; palliative care.
Additional relevant studies, published through Sep-
tember 2021 during the guideline writing process, were 
also considered by the writing committee and added to 
the evidence tables when appropriate. This guideline was 
harmonized with other ACC/AHA guidelines published 
through December 2021.The final evidence tables are 
included in the Online Data Supplement and summarize 
the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate 
recommendations. References selected and published 
in the present document are representative and not all-
inclusive.
1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee
The writing committee consisted of cardiologists, HF 
specialists, internists, interventionalists, an electro-
physiologist, surgeons, a pharmacist, an advanced 
nurse practitioner, and 2 lay/patient representatives. 
The writing committee included representatives from 
the ACC, AHA, and Heart Failure Society of America 
(HFSA). Appendix 1 of the present document lists writ-
ing committee members’ relevant RWI. For the purpos-
es of full transparency, the writing committee members’ 
comprehensive disclosure information is available in a 
Supplemental Appendix.
1.3. Document Review and Approval
This document was reviewed by 2 official reviewers nom-
inated by the AHA; 1 official reviewer nominated by the 
ACC; 2 official reviewers from the HFSA; 1 official Joint 
Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines reviewer; and 
32 individual content reviewers. Reviewers’ RWI informa-
tion was distributed to the writing committee and is pub-
lished in this document (Appendix 2).This document was 
approved for publication by the governing bodies of the 
ACC, AHA, and HFSA.
1.4. Scope of the Guideline
The purpose of the “2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline 
for the Management of Heart Failure” (2022 HF guide-
line) is to provide an update and to consolidate the “2013 
ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart 
Failure”1 for adults and the “2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA 
Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for 
the Management of Heart Failure”2 into a new document.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure GuidelineRelated ACC/AHA guidelines include recommendations 
relevant to HF and, in such cases, the HF guideline re-
fers to these documents. For example, the 2019 primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease guideline3 includes 
recommendations that will be useful in preventing HF, 
and the 2021 valvular heart disease guideline4 provides 
recommendations for mitral valve (MV) clipping in mitral 
regurgitation (MR).
Areas of focus include:
• Prevention of HF.
• Management strategies in stage C HF, including:
◦ New treatment strategies in HF, including 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors 
(SGL T2i) and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin 
inhibitors (ARNi).
◦ Management of HF and atrial fibrillation (AF), 
including ablation of AF.
◦ Management of HF and secondary MR, includ-
ing MV transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.
• Specific management strategies, including:
◦ Cardiac amyloidosis.
◦ Cardio-oncology.
• Implantable devices.
• Left ventricular assist device (L VAD) use in stage D 
H F.
The intended primary target audience consists of 
clinicians who are involved in the care of patients with 
HF. Recommendations are stated in reference to the 
patients and their condition. The focus is to provide the 
most up-to-date evidence to inform the clinician during 
shared decision-making with the patient. Although the 
present document is not intended to be a procedural-
based manual of recommendations that outlines the 
best practice for HF, there are certain practices that 
clinicians might use that are associated with improved 
clinical outcomes.
In developing the 2022 HF guideline, the writing com-
mittee reviewed previously published guidelines and 
related statements. Table 1 contains a list of these guide-
lines and statements deemed pertinent to this writing 
effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating 
the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations.
1.5. Class of Recommendation and Level of 
Evidence
The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the 
strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimat-
ed magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to 
risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of sci-
entific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis 
of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical 
trials and other sources (Table 2).11.6. Abbreviations

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline2. DEFINITION OF HF
HF Description
HF is a complex clinical syndrome with symptoms and 
signs that result from any structural or functional im-
pairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The 
writing committee recognizes that asymptomatic stages 
with structural heart disease or cardiomyopathies are 
not covered under the above definition as having HF. 
Such asymptomatic stages are considered at-risk for HF 
(stage A) or pre-HF (stage B), as explained in Section 
2.1, “Stages of HF. ”
2.1. Stages of HF
The ACC/AHA stages of HF (Figure 1, Table 3) 
emphasize the development and progression of dis-
ease,1,2 and advanced stages and progression are as-sociated with reduced survival.3 Therapeutic interven-
tions in each stage aim to modify risk factors (stage 
A), treat risk and structural heart disease to prevent 
HF (stage B), and reduce symptoms, morbidity, and 
mortality (stages C and D). To address the evolving 
role of biomarkers and structural changes for recogni-
tion of patients who are at risk of developing HF, who 
are potential candidates for targeted treatment strat-
egies for the prevention of HF, and to enhance the 
understanding and adoption of these classifications, 
the writing committee proposed the terminologies 
listed in Table 3 for the stages of HF. For thresholds 
of cardiac structural, functional changes, elevated fill-
ing pressures, and biomarker elevations, refer to Ap-
pendix 3.
New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Classification
The NYHA classification is used to characterize symp-
toms and functional capacity of patients with symp-
tomatic (stage C) HF or advanced HF (stage D). It is 
a subjective assessment by a clinician and can change 
over time. Although reproducibility and validity can be 
limited,4,5 the NYHA functional classification is an inde-
pendent predictor of mortality,6,7 and it is widely used in 
clinical practice to determine the eligibility of patients for 
treatment strategies. Clinicians specify NYHA classifica-
tion at baseline after the initial diagnosis and after treat-
ment through the continuum of care of a patient with 
HF. Although a patient with symptomatic HF (stage C) 
may become asymptomatic with treatment (NYHA class 
I), that patient will still be categorized as stage C HF. Pa-
tients with stage C HF can be classified according to the 
trajectory of their symptoms (Figure 2).
2.2. Classification of HF by Left Ventricular 
Ejection Fraction (LVEF)
L VEF is considered important in the classification of 
patients with HF because of differing prognosis and 
response to treatments and because most clinical tri-
als select patients based on ejection fraction (EF). 
RCTs with evidence of survival benefit in patients with 
HF have mainly enrolled patients with HF with an 
L VEF ≤35% or ≤ 40%, often labeled HF with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF).1 In this guideline, HFrEF is 
defined as L VEF ≤40% (Table 4). HF with preserved 
EF (HFpEF) represents at least 50% of the popula-
tion with HF, and its prevalence is increasing.2 HFpEF 
has been variably classified as L VEF >40%, >45%, or 
≥50%. Because some of these patients do not have 
entirely normal L VEF but also do not have major re-
duction in systolic function, the term preserved EF has 
been used. In this guideline, the threshold for HFpEF 
is an L VEF ≥ 50% (Table 4).MCS mechanical circulatory support

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure GuidelinePatients with HF and an L VEF between the HFrEF 
and HFpEF range have been termed as “HF with mid-
range EF, ”3,4 or “HF with mildly reduced EF. ”4 Because 
of L VEF being lower than normal, these patients are 
classified in this document as HF with mildly reduced 
EF (HFmrEF). Patients with HFmrEF are usually in 
a dynamic trajectory to improvement from HFrEF or 
to deterioration to HFrEF (Figure 3). Therefore, for 
patients whose EF falls into this mildly reduced cat-
egory, 1 EF measurement at 1 time point may not be 
adequate, and the trajectory of L VEF over time and 
the cause is important to evaluate (Figure 3). Further-
more, the diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF can be 
challenging. Although the classic clinical signs and 
symptoms of HF, together with EF of 41% to 49% or ≥50%, respectively, are necessary for the diagno-
sis of the HFmrEF and HFpEF, the requirements for 
additional objective measures of cardiac dysfunction 
can improve the diagnostic specificity. The signs and 
symptoms of HF are frequently nonspecific and over-
lap with other clinical conditions. Elevated natriuretic 
peptide levels are supportive of the diagnosis, but 
normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFmrEF 
or HFpEF. To improve the specificity of diagnosing 
HFmrEF and HFpEF, the clinical diagnosis of HF in 
these EF categories should be further supported by 
objective measures. Therefore, the writing commit-
tee proposes the addition of evidence of spontane-
ous (at rest) or provokable (eg, during exercise, fluid 
challenge) increased L V filling pressures (eg, elevated Table 2. Applying American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Class of Recommendation and Level of

The “2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Man-
agement of Heart Failure”1 has used the HFpEF-
improved terminology for those whose EF improved 
from a lower level to EF >40% under the subgroup-
ing of patients with HFpEF. Others have proposed a working definition of HF-recovered EF that included a 
baseline L VEF ≤ 40%, a ≥ 10% increase from baseline 
L VEF, and a second measurement of L VEF >40%.3 
Although associated with better outcomes, improve-
ment in L VEF does not mean full myocardial recov-
ery or normalization of L V function. In most patients,

Table 3. Stages of HF
Stages Definition and Criteria
Stage A: At Risk for HF At risk for HF but without symptoms, structural heart disease, or cardiac biomarkers of stretch or injury (eg, patients with 
hypertension, atherosclerotic CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity, exposure to cardiotoxic agents, genetic 
variant for cardiomyopathy, or positive family history of cardiomyopathy).
Stage B: Pre-HF No symptoms or signs of HF and evidence of 1 of the following:
Structural heart disease*
  Reduced left or right ventricular systolic function
  Reduced ejection fraction, reduced strain
  Ventricular hypertrophy
  Chamber enlargement
  Wall motion abnormalities
  Valvular heart disease
Evidence for increased filling pressures*
  By invasive hemodynamic measurements
  By noninvasive imaging suggesting elevated filling pressures (eg, Doppler echocardiography)
Patients with risk factors and
  Increased levels of BNPs* or
  Persistently elevated cardiac troponin
in the absence of competing diagnoses resulting in such biomarker elevations such as acute coronary syndrome, CKD, 
pulmonary embolus, or myopericarditis
Stage C: Symptomatic HF Structural heart disease with current or previous symptoms of HF.
Stage D: Advanced HF Marked HF symptoms that interfere with daily life and with recurrent hospitalizations despite attempts to optimize GDMT.
BNP indicates B-type natriuretic peptide; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease; GDMT, guideline-directed medical therapy; and HF, heart failure.

L VEF might not be unidirectional; a patient may have 
improvement followed by a decrease in EF or vice 
versa depending on the underlying cause, duration 
of disease, adherence to the GDMT, or reexposure 
to cardiotoxicity.5 Therefore, the writing committee 
elected not to use “recovered EF” or HFpEF, even 
if subsequent L VEF was >50% but, rather, “HF with 
improved EF” (HFimpEF) as a subgroup of HFrEF to 
characterize these patients (Table 4, Figure 3). Impor-
tantly, EF can decrease after withdrawal of pharmaco-
logical treatment in many patients who had improved 
EF to normal range with GDMT.5 Trajectory of L VEF 
can be important, and a significant reduction in L VEF 
over time is a poor prognostic factor.2.3. Diagnostic Algorithm for Classification of 
HF According to LVEF
Structural and functional alterations of the heart as the 
underlying cause for the clinical presentation support 
the diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF1 (Figure 4). The 
criteria for diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF require 
evidence of increased L V filling pressures at rest, exer-
cise, or other provocations. The criteria can be fulfilled 
with findings of elevated levels of natriuretic peptides, 
echocardiographic diastolic parameters such as an 
E/e′ ≥15 or other evidence of elevated filling pres-
sures, or invasive hemodynamic measurement at rest 
or exercise. Evidence of structural heart disease (eg, 
L V structural or functional alterations) may be used to 
further support the diagnosis of HFpEF. Key structural 
alterations are an increase in left atrial size and volume 
(left atrial volume index) and/or an increase in L V mass 
(L V mass index).
Exercise stress testing with echocardiographic 
evaluation of diastolic parameters can be helpful if 
the diagnosis remains uncertain.2,3 Alternatively, or in 
addition, invasive hemodynamics at rest or with exer-
cise, with assessment of filling pressures (pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure or L V end diastolic pressures, 
pulmonary artery [PA] pressures, stroke volumes, and 
cardiac output) can be performed to help further estab-
lish the diagnosis.4
The diagnosis of HFpEF is often challenging. A clin-
ical composite score to diagnose HFpEF, the H2FPEF 
score,5–7 integrates these predictive variables: obesity, 
atrial fibrillation (AF), age >60 years, treatment with 
≥2 antihypertensive medications, echocardiographic 
E/e′ ratio >9, and echocardiographic PA systolic pres-
sure >35 mm Hg. A weighted score based on these 
Figure 2. Trajectory of Stage C HF.
The trajectory of stage C HF is displayed. Patients whose symptoms and signs of HF are resolved are still stage C and should be treated 
accordingly. If all HF symptoms, signs, and structural abnormalities resolve, the patient is considered to have HF in remission. HF indicates heart 
failure; and L V, left ventricular. *Full resolution of structural and functional cardiac abnormalities is uncommon.

AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline6 variables was used to create the composite score 
ranging from 0 to 9. The odds of HFpEF doubled for 
each 1-unit score increase (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% 
CI: 1.74-2.30; P <0.0001), with a c-statistic of 0.841. 
Scores <2 and ≥ 6 reflect low and high likelihood, 
respectively, for HFpEF. A score between 2 and 5 may 
require further evaluation of hemodynamics with exer-
cise echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization to con-
firm or negate a diagnosis of HFpEF. The use of this 
H2FPEF score may help to facilitate discrimination of 
HFpEF from noncardiac causes of dyspnea and can 
assist in determination of the need for further diag-
nostic testing in the evaluation of patients with unex-
plained exertional dyspnea.6,7
The European Society of Cardiology has developed 
a diagnostic algorithm.8 This involves a pretest that 
assesses for HF symptoms and signs, typical clini-
cal demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, elderly, AF), and diagnostic laboratory tests, ECG, and 
echocardiography. In the absence of overt noncardiac 
causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected 
if there is a normal L VEF, no significant heart valve 
disease or cardiac ischemia, and at least 1 typical risk 
factor. The score used functional, morphological, and 
biomarker domains. The points score assigns 2 points 
for a major criterion or 1 point for a minor criterion 
within each domain, with a maximum of 2 points for 
each domain.

United States, in large part because of the aging popula-
Figure 3. Classification and Trajectories of HF Based on LVEF.
See Appendix 3 for suggested thresholds for laboratory findings. The classification for baseline and subsequent L VEF is shown. Patients with 
HFrEF who improve their L VEF to >40% are considered to have HFimpEF and should continue HFrEF treatment. HF indicates heart failure; 
HFimpEF, heart failure with improved ejection fraction; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and L VEF, left ventricular ejection fraction. *There is limited 
evidence to guide treatment for patients who improve their L VEF from mildly reduced (41%-49%) to ≥50%. It is unclear whether to treat these 
patients as HFpEF or HFmrEF.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guidelinetion.1,2 Beginning in 2012, the age-adjusted death rate 
per capita for HF increased for the first time in the Unit-
ed States.3 A recent US evaluation found total deaths 
caused by HF have increased from 275 000 in 2009 to 
310 000 in 2014.3
US hospitalizations for HF decreased up until 20124; 
however, from 2013 to 2017 , an increase in HF hospitaliza-
tions was observed. In 2017 , there were 1.2 million HF hos-
pitalizations in the United States among 924 000 patients 
with HF.4 This represents a 26% increase in HF hospitaliza-
tions and number of patients hospitalized with HF.
Although the absolute number of patients with HF 
has partly grown as a result of the increasing number of 
older adults, the incidence of HF has decreased.5 Among 
US Medicare beneficiaries, HF incidence declined from 
36 cases per 1000 beneficiaries in 2011 to 27 cases 
per 1000 beneficiaries in 2014 and remained stable 
through 2016.5 Divergent trends in the incidence of HF 
have been observed for those with HFrEF (decreasing 
incidence) and HFpEF (increasing incidence).6,7 Deaths 
attributable to cardiomyopathies have been increasing 
globally because of, in part, increased recognition, diag-
nosis, and documentation of specific cardiomyopathies 
and cardiotoxicity.2
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortality and 
Hospitalization for HF
Racial and ethnic disparities in death resulting from HF 
persist, with non-Hispanic Black patients having the highest death rate per capita.4 A report examining the 
US population found age-adjusted mortality rate for 
HF to be 92 per 100 000 individuals for non-Hispanic 
Black patients, 87 per 100 000 for non-Hispanic White 
patients, and 53 per 100 000 for Hispanic patients.4 
Among Medicare beneficiaries, non-Hispanic Black 
beneficiaries had a slightly greater decrease in HF in-
cidence (38 cases per 1000 to 26 cases per 1000, 
P=0.009) than non-Hispanic White beneficiaries (36 
cases per 1000 to 28 cases per 1000, P =0.003) from 
2011 to 2016.4 Among patients with established HF, 
non-Hispanic Black patients experienced a higher rate 
of HF hospitalization and a lower rate of death com-
pared with non-Hispanic White patients with HF.8–10 
Hispanic patients with HF have been found to have 
similar8 or higher10 HF hospitalization rates and similar10 
or lower8 mortality rates compared with non-Hispanic 
White patients. Asian/Pacific Islander patients with HF 
have had a similar rate of hospitalization as non-His-
panic White patients but a lower rate of death.8,10 These 
racial and ethnic disparities in outcome, for those with 
HF, warrant studies and health policy changes to ad-
dress health inequity.
3.2. Cause of HF
In the United States, approximately 115 million peo-
ple have hypertension, 100 million have obesity, 92 
million have prediabetes, 26 million have diabetes, 
and 125 million have atherosclerotic CVD.1 These are

tion attributable risk for development of HF. There-
fore, a large proportion of the US population can be 
categorized as being at-risk for HF or stage A HF. 
The common causes of HF include ischemic heart 
disease and myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension, 
and valvular heart disease (VHD). Other causes can 
include familial or genetic cardiomyopathies; amyloi-
dosis; cardiotoxicity with cancer or other treatments 
or substance abuse such as alcohol, cocaine, or meth-
amphetamine; tachycardia, right ventricular (RV) pac-
ing or stress-induced cardiomyopathies; peripartum 
cardiomyopathy; myocarditis; autoimmune causes, 
sarcoidosis; iron overload, including hemochromato-
sis; and thyroid disease and other endocrine metabol-
ic and nutritional causes (Table 5). Furthermore, with 
cardiac imaging and biomarkers, myocardial injury or 
cardiac maladaptive structural changes can be de-
tected at earlier phases with a higher sensitivity, even 
in the absence of gross L V dysfunction or symptoms. 
With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pan-
demic, investigators are gaining better insights into 
infection and inflammation-related myocardial injury 
and myocarditis. With the increasing ability to detect 
myocardial injury and with an increasing awareness 
of cardiotoxicity and injury patterns including inflam-
mation, pre-HF or stage B HF will likely continue to 
increase. Beyond classifications of EF and staging 
in HF, clinicians should seek the cause of HF be-
cause appropriate treatment may be determined by 
the cause (Table 5).4. INITIAL AND SERIAL EVALUATION

Synopsis
The history and physical examination remain a cornerstone 
in the assessment of patients with HF. The history and 
physical examination provide information about the cause 
of an underlying cardiomyopathy, including the possibility 
of an inherited cardiomyopathy as ascertained by a fam-
ily history or a condition requiring disease-specific therapy 
like amyloid heart disease, as well as reasons why a previ-
ously stable patient developed acutely decompensated HF. 
A critical component of the history and physical examina-
tion is to assess for clinical congestion (ie, those signs and 
symptoms resulting from elevated cardiac filling pressures). 
Congestion is a target for medication adjustment and is as-
sociated with quality of life (QOL) and prognosis. The his-
tory and physical examination also allow for the determina-
tion of clinical clues that suggest the patient has advanced 
HF, which may warrant referral to an advanced HF center.

wave response to the Valsalva maneuver,20 and leg 
edema.6 On a practical level, clinicians use extent 
of clinical congestion to guide titration of pharma-
cological treatments, including doses of diuretics. 
Observational studies have shown that clinical 
congestion is an important adverse risk factor in 
patients with HF.1–6,17 Recently, the PARADIGM-HF 
(The Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to 
Enalapril on Morbidity and Mortality of Patients With 
Chronic Heart Failure) investigators showed that, 
in patients with chronic HFrEF, changes in markers 
of clinical congestion were associated with QOL 
as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire and also provided prognostic infor-
mation independently even of natriuretic peptides 
or the MAGGIC (Meta-analysis Global Group in 
Chronic Heart Failure) risk score.2 These data 
highlight the ongoing relevance of clinical con-
gestion ascertained by the history and physical 
examination.
2. Some patients with HF progress to an advanced 
state, a condition that can be treated with special-
ized interventions such as mechanical circulatory 
support (MCS) or cardiac transplantation. Such 
patients should be identified before they progress 
to a state of extremis, at which point they may suc-
cumb to their illness or suffer complications of 
an intervention as a result of their very advanced 
state. Several “simple clinical clues” are available 
to identify advanced HF and should be ascertained 
via a focused history and physical examination. The 
recognition that a patient has advanced HF will 
allow for earlier referral to an advanced HF center, 
when appropriate, as will be discussed later in this 
document (see Section 8, “Specialty Referral for 
Advanced HF”).
3. Increasingly, familial cardiomyopathy is recognized 
as a more accurate diagnosis in some patients 
previously classified as having an idiopathic dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM). A detailed family history 
may provide the first clue of a genetic basis. A 
broad array of questions includes whether family 
members had a weak, enlarged, or thick heart, or 
HF; muscular dystrophy; a pacemaker or defibril-
lator; were on a heart transplant list; or died unex-
pectedly. Periodic updating of the family history in 
patients with a cardiomyopathy of uncertain origin 
may lead to a diagnosis of familial cardiomyopathy 
in the event that a relative subsequently develops a 
cardiomyopathy or a related complication. A 3-gen-
eration family pedigree obtained by genetic health care professionals improved the rate of detection 
of a familial process as compared with routine 
care.14 Furthermore, a family history of cardiomy-
opathy, as determined by a 3-generation pedigree 
analysis, was associated with findings of gadolin-
ium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and increased major adverse car-
diac events.13 The possibility of an inherited car-
diomyopathy provides the impetus for cascade 
screening of undiagnosed family members, thereby 
potentially avoiding preventable adverse events in 
affected relatives by implementation of GDMT and 
other management that otherwise would not be 
initiated.
4. Certain conditions that cause HF require disease-
specific therapies. For example, in amyloid heart 
disease, whether on the basis of transthyretin21 or 
light chain deposition,22 there are specific treat-
ments that otherwise would not be used in patients 
with HF. Hence, expeditious and accurate diag-
nosis of such conditions is important. Currently, 
important delays have been reported in diagnos-
ing amyloid heart disease,16 perhaps not unexpect-
edly given the wide spectrum of possible clinical 
presentations.15 Similarly, HF attributable to sar-
coidosis, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, hyper-
thyroidism, acromegaly, connective tissue disease, 
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or high-
output HF from an arteriovenous fistula, among 
others, requires specific therapeutic approaches. 
Given that the differential diagnosis of HF is broad, 
the history and physical examination can provide 
clues to narrow the number of causes to consider 
and guide the diagnostic approach to identify such 
conditions (Table 5).
5. The history and physical examination help to 
identify the cause of a clinical deterioration. To 
determine the cause of a clinical deterioration, 
the clinician assesses for concurrent illness (eg, 
ongoing myocardial ischemia, pulmonary emboli, 
or systemic infection), initiation of a medication 
potentially detrimental in the setting of HF (eg, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), 
or the possibility of chronic RV pacing (eg, a 
newly implanted pacemaker or medications such 
as amiodarone that leads to bradycardia and 
resultant chronic RV pacing), nonadherence to 
a medication or dietary regimen, and ongoing 
substance abuse. In addition, an assessment of 
social determinants of health (eg, housing stabil-
ity, food security, available transportation) should 
be made.

specific diagnostic testing and evaluation is often neces-
sary to identify specific cause and other comorbidities in 
patients with HF.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Identifying the specific cause of HF is impor-
tant, because conditions that cause HF may 
require disease-specific therapies. Depending 
on the clinical suspicion, additional diagnostic 
studies are usually required to diagnose specific 
causes (Table 6) such as ischemic cardiomy-
opathy, cardiac amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemo-
chromatosis, infectious mechanisms (eg, HIV, 
COVID-19, Chagas), hypothyroidism, hyperthy-
roidism, acromegaly, connective tissue disorders, 
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo, 
peripartum cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity with 
cancer therapies, or substance abuse would 
require specific management in addition to or 
beyond GDMT.1,2,9–152. Laboratory evaluation with complete blood count, 
urinalysis, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitro-
gen, serum creatinine, glucose, fasting lipid pro-
file, liver function tests, iron studies (serum iron, 
ferritin, transferrin saturation), and thyroid-stimu-
lating hormone levels provides important informa-
tion regarding patients’ comorbidities, suitability 
for and adverse effects of treatments, potential 
causes or confounders of HF, severity and prog-
nosis of HF, and is usually performed on initial 
evaluation. Pertinent laboratory tests are repeated 
with changes in clinical condition or treatments 
(eg, to monitor renal function or electrolytes with 
diuretics).
3. Electrocardiography is part of the routine evalua-
tion of a patient with HF and provides important 
information on rhythm, heart rate, QRS morphol-
ogy and duration, cause, and prognosis of HF. 
It is repeated when there is a clinical indication, 
such as a suspicion for arrhythmia, ischemia or 
myocardial injury, conduction, or other cardiac 
abnormalities.Table 6. Selected Potential Causes of Elevated Natriuretic

1 A1. In patients presenting with dyspnea, measure-
ment of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or 
N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a 
diagnosis or exclusion of HF.1–12
1 A2. In patients with chronic HF, measurements of 
BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended 
for risk stratification.11,13–29
1 A3. In patients hospitalized for HF, measurement 
of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is 
recommended to establish prognosis.11,13–19
2a B-R4. In patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or 
NT-proBNP–based screening followed by 
team-based care, including a cardiovascular 
specialist, can be useful to prevent the devel-
opment of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF.30,31
2a B-NR5. In patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge 
BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to 
inform the trajectory of the patient and estab-
lish a postdischarge prognosis.14,17 ,20–29
Synopsis
Assays for BNP and NT-proBNP are frequently used 
to establish the presence and severity of HF. In general, 
BNP and NT-proBNP levels are similar, and either can 
be used in patient care settings as long as their respec-
tive absolute values and cut-points are not used inter-
changeably.32–34 Obesity is associated with lower levels of 
BNP and NT-proBNP thereby reducing their diagnostic 
sensitivity.35,36 A substantial evidence base supports the 
use of natriuretic peptide biomarkers for excluding HF 
as a cause of symptoms in ambulatory and emergency 
department settings. Although a reduction in BNP and 
NT-proBNP has been associated with better outcomes, 
the evidence for treatment guidance using serial BNP 
or NT-proBNP measurements remains insufficient.37–39 
Lastly, a widening array of biomarkers including mark-
ers of myocardial injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, 
vascular dysfunction, and matrix remodeling have been 
shown to provide incremental prognostic information 
over natriuretic peptides but remain without evidence of 
an incremental management benefit.13,40–49
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Measurement of BNP and NT-proBNP levels in the 
ambulatory setting for a suspected cardiac cause 
of dyspnea provides incremental diagnostic value 
to clinical judgment when the cause of dyspnea is 
unclear and the physical examination equivocal.1–9 
In the emergency setting, BNP and NT-proBNP levels have higher sensitivity than specificity and 
may be more useful for ruling out HF than ruling in 
HF. Although lower levels of BNP and NT-proBNP 
may help exclude the presence of HF, and higher 
levels have high positive predictive value to diag-
nose HF, increases in both BNP and NT-proBNP 
levels have been reported in patients with various 
cardiac and noncardiac causes (Table 6).50–53
2. and 3. Higher levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are 
associated with a greater risk for adverse short- 
and long-term outcomes in patients with HF, includ-
ing all-cause and cardiovascular death and major 
cardiovascular events.11,13–19 Studies have shown 
incremental prognostic value of these biomark-
ers to standard approaches of CVD risk assess-
ment.11,16 Not all patients may need biomarker 
measurement for prognostication, especially if they 
already have advanced HF with established poor 
prognosis or persistently elevated levels of bio-
markers in former settings.
4. The STOP-HF (St Vincent’s Screening to Prevent 
Heart Failure) study is a large single-center trial 
of patients at risk of HF, defined by the presence 
of hypertension, diabetes, or known vascular dis-
ease but without established L V systolic dys-
function or symptomatic HF, who were randomly 
assigned to screening with BNP testing or usual 
care.31 Participants in the intervention group with 
BNP levels ≥50 pg/mL underwent echocardiog-
raphy and referral to a cardiovascular special-
ist.31 All patients received coaching by a specialist 
nurse who provided education on the importance 
of adherence to medication and healthy lifestyle 
behaviors.31 BNP-based screening reduced the 
composite endpoint of incident asymptomatic L V 
dysfunction with or without newly diagnosed HF. 
Similarly, accelerated uptitration of renin-angioten-
sin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists and 
beta blockers reduced cardiac events in patients 
with diabetes and elevated NT-proBNP levels but 
without cardiac disease at baseline.30 Standardized 
screening for HF remains challenging as a result 
of the heterogeneity of risk factors across different 
patient populations. Studies are needed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness and risks of such screening, 
as well as its impact on QOL and mortality.
5. Predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are 
strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital 
readmission for HF.14,17 ,20–29 Although patients in 
whom levels of BNP or NT-proBNP decreased with

any changes or with a biomarker rise,14,23,28,29 tar-

1 B-NR1. In first-degree relatives of selected patients 
with genetic or inherited cardiomyopathies, 
genetic screening and counseling are recom-
mended to detect cardiac disease and prompt 
consideration of treatments to decrease HF 
progression and sudden death.1,2
2a B-NR2. In select patients with nonischemic cardio-
myopathy, referral for genetic counseling and 
testing is reasonable to identify conditions that 
could guide treatment for patients and family 
members.3,4
Synopsis
In patients in whom a genetic or inherited cardiomy-
opathy is suspected, a family history should be per-
formed, including at least 3 generations and ideally diagrammed as a family tree pedigree (see Section 
4.1, “Clinical Assessment: History and Physical Ex-
amination”). Genetic variants have been implicated in 
25% to 40% of patients with DCM with a positive fam-
ily history but also in 10% to 30% of patients without 
a recognized family history.3,4 Phenotype and family 
history are important for identifying patients in whom 
genetic testing is most likely to yield clinically action-
able information (Table 7). Presentation of DCM with 
conduction disease or ventricular arrhythmias raises 
concern of sarcoidosis and arrhythmogenic cardio-
myopathy, which is of particular concern because of 
the risk of sudden death in patients and families.5 No 
controlled studies have shown clinical benefits of ge-
netic testing for cardiomyopathy, but genetic testing 
contributes to risk stratification and has implications 
for treatment, currently most often for decisions re-
garding defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden 
death5 and regarding exercise limitation for hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy and the desmosomal variants. 
Consultation with a trained counselor before and af-
ter genetic testing helps patients to understand and 
weigh the implications of possible results for their 
own lives and those of family members, including pos-
sible discrimination on the basis of genetic informa-
tion. Unless shown to be free of the genetic variant(s) 
implicated in the proband, first-degree relatives of af-
fected probands should undergo periodic screening 
with echocardiography and electrocardiography.Table 7. Examples of Factors Implicating Possible Genetic Cardiomyopathy

1. and 2. Inherited dilated, restrictive, and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathies have been identified, although 1 
gene variant may cause different phenotypes in the 
same family. The most common pathogenic variants 
identified are truncations in the large structural protein 
titin, which have been implicated in DCM3–5 and also 
in peripartum or alcoholic cardiomyopathies; however, 
variants that do not cause disease are also common. 
Pathogenic variants in lamin A/C can be associated 
with conduction block and atrial arrhythmias as well 
as ventricular arrhythmias, which may progress more 
rapidly than symptoms of HF. Although previously 
linked with the phenotype of arrhythmogenic RV car-
diomyopathy, desmosomal protein variants are now 
recognized to affect the left ventricle also with or with-
out the right ventricle, and the term arrhythmogenic 
cardiomyopathy is now preferred for the phenotype 
of arrhythmias combined with DCM. Filamin-C muta-
tions have been associated with skeletal myopathies 
and with isolated cardiomyopathy with ventricular 
arrhythmias. The identification of pathogenic variants 
associated with increased risk of sudden death may 
trigger consideration of primary prevention implant-
able cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) even in patients 
who have L VEF >0.35 or <3 months of guideline-
recommended therapies.6 Evidence of desmosomal 
cardiac disease carries the additional implication of 
advice to avoid strenuous exercise, which may accel-
erate ventricular remodeling.7 Genetic confirmation of 
symptomatic Fabry’s cardiomyopathy is an indication 
for replacement therapy with the enzyme agalsidase 
beta, and migalastat was recently approved for this 
uncommon cardiomyopathy.

ment of LV function is not indicated.
Synopsis
Cardiac imaging has a key role in the initial evaluation 
of individuals with suspected HF and, when indicated, 
in the serial assessment of patients with HF. After a 
complete history and physical examination, a com-
prehensive TTE is the most useful initial diagnostic 
test given the vast amount of diagnostic and prognos-
tic information provided. The determination of L VEF 
is a fundamental step to classify HF and to guide 
evidence-based pharmacological and device-based 
therapy. In certain situations, the echocardiogram is 
unable to accurately assess cardiac structure and/or 
function or more information is needed to determine 
the cause of the cardiac dysfunction. Other imaging 
modalities, such as CMR, SPECT or radionuclide ven-
triculography, PET, or cardiac CT or invasive coronary 
angiography, can provide additional and complemen-
tary information to cardiac ultrasound.11 In general, 
cardiac imaging tests, including repeat tests, are per-
formed only when the results have a meaningful im-
pact on clinical care.Recommendations for Evaluation With Cardiac Imaging (Continued)

1. The chest x-ray is a useful initial diagnostic test for 
the evaluation of patients presenting with signs and 
symptoms of HF because it assesses cardiomeg-
aly, pulmonary venous congestion, and interstitial or 
alveolar edema and may reveal alternative causes, 
cardiopulmonary or otherwise, of the patient’s 
symptoms.1,2 Apart from congestion, other findings 
on chest x-ray are associated with HF only in the 
context of clinical presentation. Importantly, cardio-
megaly may be absent in acute HF and, although 
cephalization, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema 
are modestly specific for HF, these findings are rel-
atively insensitive.2,33 Considering the limited sensi-
tivity and specificity, the chest x-ray should not be 
used as the only determinant of the specific cause 
or presence of HF.

size, and all valves are evaluated for anatomic and 
flow abnormalities. Guidelines also provide recom-
mendations for diastolic function and estimates 
of L V filling and left atrial pressure.42 The tricus-
pid valve regurgitant gradient, coupled with inferior 
vena cava diameter and its response during respi-
ration, provides estimates of systolic PA pressure 
and central venous pressure. Indices of myocardial 
deformation, such as global longitudinal strain, may 
identify subclinical L V systolic dysfunction, which 
has been associated with greater risk of developing 
HF or recurrent HF hospitalizations.38,43–46 Given 
the widespread availability, lack of ionizing radia-
tion, and wealth of provided information, echocar-
diography is the preferred initial imaging modality 
for evaluation of patients with suspected HF. Point-
of-care cardiac ultrasound is an evolving tool for 
assessment of cardiac function and assessment of 
volume status and pulmonary congestion.47–52
3. Serial echocardiograms to assess changes in 
EF, structural remodeling, and valvular function, 
although not recommended routinely in stable 
patients, are useful in various situations. In patients 
who have an unexplained, significant change 
in clinical status, echocardiography can provide 
important information, such as worsening ven-
tricular or valvular function. A subset of patients 
may also have reverse remodeling, improvement in L VEF, and valvular function in response to 
evidence-based medical, revascularization, and 
device therapies, and repeat assessment of L VEF 
and remodeling is appropriate in those who have 
received treatments that might have had a signifi-
cant effect on cardiac structure and function.4–7 ,53–59 
Recovery of function appears more common in 
those with L V systolic dysfunction occurring in the 
setting of adverse energetic circumstances (eg, 
chronic tachycardia or thyroid disease), dilated car-
diomyopathies associated with immune responses 
(eg, peripartum cardiomyopathy, acute myocardi-
tis, systemic inflammatory responses), or in those 
who have undergone revascularization or device-
based therapies.60 Reevaluation of EF (>40 days 
after MI, >90 days after revascularization, >90 
days after GDMT) is useful to determine candidacy 
for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Finally, 
repeat surveillance of L V function is appropriate 
in patients exposed to treatments that potentially 
damage the myocardium, such as chemotherapy.
4. If TTE is unable to accurately evaluate cardiac 
structure and function, additional noninvasive 
imaging modalities are available to clarify the ini-
tial diagnosis and to provide information on car-
diac structure and function. The choice between 
these modalities depends on availability, local 
expertise, patient characteristics, indication, and 
goal of limiting radiation exposure. CMR provides 
an accurate and highly reproducible assessment 
of cardiac volumes, mass, and EF of the left and 
right ventricles.8–10 CMR provides high anatomic 
resolution of all aspects of the heart and surround-
ing structures and is not associated with ioniz-
ing radiation, leading to its recommended use in 
known or suspected congenital heart diseases.11,61 
Electrocardiographic-gated cardiac CT can also 
accurately assess ventricular size, EF, and wall 
motion abnormalities, but it is accompanied with 
ionizing radiation.13–15 Radionuclide ventriculog-
raphy is highly reproducible for measurement of 
L VEF, although it also exposes the patient to ion-
izing radiation.12
5. CMR provides noninvasive characterization of the 
myocardium that may provide insights into HF 
cause.62 Late-gadolinium enhancement, reflect-
ing fibrosis and damaged myocardium, can iden-
tify acute and chronic MI.63,64 and identify HF 
caused by CAD65,66 Patterns of late-gadolinium 
enhancement or specific T-1 and T-2 techniques 
can suggest specific infiltrative and inflammatory 
cardiomyopathies, such as myocarditis, sarcoid-

that CMR findings commonly impact patient care 
management and provide diagnostic information 
in patients with suspected myocarditis or cardio-
myopathy,17 ,18 a strategy of routine screening with 
CMR in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy 
was not shown to yield more specific HF causes 
than a strategy of selective CMR strategy based 
on echocardiographic and clinical findings in a 
recent trial.78
6. HF is often caused by coronary atherosclerosis,79 
and evaluation for ischemic heart disease can help 
in determining the presence of significant coronary 
artery disease (CAD). Noninvasive stress imag-
ing with echocardiography or nuclear scintigraphy 
can be helpful in identifying patients likely to have 
obstructive CAD.24,25 Invasive or computed tomog-
raphy coronary angiography can detect and char-
acterize extent of CAD.26,27
7 . CAD is a leading cause of HF79 and myocardial 
ischemia may contribute to new or worsening HF 
symptoms. Noninvasive testing (ie, stress echo-
cardiography, SPECT, CMR, or PET) may be con-
sidered for detection of myocardial ischemia to 
help guide coronary revascularization decisions. 
Multiple nonrandomized, observational studies 
have reported improved survival with revascular-
ization in patients with viable but dysfunctional 
myocardium.28,30–32 Despite these observational 
data, RCTs have not shown that viability imag-
ing improves guidance of revascularization 
to a reduction of adverse cardiovascular out-
comes.80–82 A prespecified viability substudy 
of the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic 
Heart Failure) trial showed that the presence of 
myocardial viability did not determine the long-
term benefit from surgical revascularization in 
patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.81,82 Of 
note, a relatively small number of individuals 
enrolled in the STICH substudy did not have 
viability, which may limit the power of the study. 
Although these data do not support the concept 
of routine viability assessment before revascu-
larization, myocardial viability is used as one of 
the tools to inform decisions regarding revas-
cularization in patients with high surgical risk or 
with complex medical problems.

Synopsis
Invasive evaluation of patients with HF may provide 
important clinical information to determine the cause 
of HF and treatment options. Routine right heart cath-
eterization does not provide sufficient information to 
guide treatment decisions.3,4 However, hemodynamic 
evaluation with right heart catheterization and moni-
toring in the setting of acute respiratory distress, sys-
temic hypoperfusion including cardiogenic shock, or 
when hemodynamics are uncertain, may guide treat-
ment decisions. Coronary angiography may be useful 
in patients who are candidates for revascularization7–9 
(see Section 4.4, “Evaluation with Cardiac Imaging,” for 
recommendations). Endomyocardial biopsy may be ad-
vantageous in patients with HF in which a histological 
diagnosis, such as amyloidosis or myocarditis, may in-
fluence treatment decisions.1,2

1. Endomyocardial biopsy may be useful when seeking 
a specific diagnosis that would influence treatment, 
and biopsy should thus be considered in patients 
with rapidly progressive clinical HF or worsening 
ventricular dysfunction that persists despite appro-
priate medical treatment. Endomyocardial biopsy 
should also be considered in patients suspected 
of having acute cardiac rejection status after heart 
transplantation or having myocardial infiltrative 
processes. A specific example is to determine 
treatment for light chain (AL) amyloidosis or trans-
thyretin amyloidosis.5 Additional indications for 
endomyocardial biopsy include patients with rap-
idly progressive and unexplained cardiomyopathy 
and those in whom active myocarditis, especially 
giant cell myocarditis, is being considered.1

1. The CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor

in NYHA Class III Heart Failure patients) trial 
reported a significant 28% reduction of HF-related 
hospitalizations after 6 months in patients random-
ized to an implanted PA pressure monitor compared 
with a control group.1 Patients had to have a HF 
hospitalization in the previous year and be on stable 
doses of a beta blocker and angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) (or angiotensin (II) recep-
tor blocker [ARB]) if tolerated. The clinical benefit 
persisted after longer term follow-up and was seen 
in both subjects with reduced3 and preserved2 LV E F.  
However, CHAMPION was a nonblinded trial, and 
there was differential contact of study personnel with 
patients in the treatment arm, raising methodologi-
cal concerns about the opportunity for bias to have 
influenced its results.19–21 In the recent GUIDE-HF

Synopsis
Functional impairment and exercise intolerance are com-
mon in HF. CPET and the 6-minute walk test are standard-
ized, reliable, and reproducible tests to quantify functional 
capacity.19–22 The NYHA functional classification can be 
used to grade the severity of functional limitation based on 
patient report of symptoms experienced with activity1 and 
is used to define candidates for certain treatments.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. NYHA functional classification is an ordinal, categor-
ical variable (I-IV) that is used to document functional 
limitation in patients with cardiac disease, including 
H F.1 In HF, NYHA functional class I includes patients 
with no limitations in physical activity resulting from their HF. NYHA class II includes patients who are 
comfortable at rest but have slight symptoms result-
ing from HF (dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness) with 
ordinary activity. NYHA class III includes patients 
who are comfortable at rest but have symptoms of 
HF with less than ordinary activity. NYHA class IV 
includes patients who are unable to carry out any 
physical activity without symptoms and have symp-
toms at rest. NYHA functional classification has 
been widely used in clinical practice, clinical trials, 
and clinical practice guidelines to determine candi-
dacy for drug and device therapy. Limitations include 
its ability to be inconsistently assessed from 1 clini-
cian to another, resulting in poor reproducibility.23
2. Many CPET variables have been associated with 
prognosis in patients with HF.4,5,12,14,16,24 Peak exer-
cise oxygen consumption/oxygen uptake (VO2) is 
often used to risk stratify patients and make deci-
sions about timing of advanced HF therapies, includ-
ing heart transplantation and L VAD. In a landmark 
article,7 investigators divided patients referred for 
heart transplantation into groups based on their peak 
VO2.7 Patients with peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min were 
listed for transplant, while those with higher peak VO2 
values were deferred for being too well. Patients with 
peak VO2 >14 mL/kg/min who were deferred had 
1- and 2-year survival of 94% and 84%, respectively, 
which was similar to survival after heart transplant. 
As such, the authors proposed peak VO2 ≤14 mL/
kg/min as a cutoff to distinguish patients who may 
derive survival benefit from heart transplant.7 Patients 
tolerating beta blockers may have improved survival 
with an equivalent VO2 compared with patients who 
do not tolerate beta blockers.25,26 For patients on 
beta blockers, a peak VO2 ≤12 mL/kg/min has been 
suggested as a more appropriate cutoff to consider 
cardiac transplant listing.8
3. Objective assessment of exercise capacity with 
CPET can be useful in the clinical management 
of patients with HF. Although CPET remains the 
gold standard measure of exercise capacity, limita-
tions to more widespread use include need for spe-
cial equipment and trained personnel, which leads 
to lack of availability at many hospitals and clinics. 
Furthermore, it is not well tolerated by some patients. 
The 6-minute walk test is an alternative way to mea-
sure exercise capacity that is widely available and 
well tolerated by patients. It entails walking for 6 
minutes on a measured flat course, and patients are 
allowed to slow down or stop if needed. A system-
atic review of 14 studies found that the 6-minute 
walk test results correlated moderately with peak 
VO2 levels and were a reliable and valid indicator 
of functional capacity in patients with HF who did 
not walk >490 m.8 Distance walked in the 6-minute 
walk test has been associated with prognosis in HF

m roughly correlates to patients with NYHA class III 
to IV symptoms and is associated with worse 3-year 
survival free of heart transplant (62% versus 82% 
for those walking ≥ 300 m).27
4. Dyspnea is a complex symptom that can reflect 
abnormalities in a number of different systems 
and can be influenced by psychological and envi-
ronmental factors. CPET involves having patients 
perform a treadmill (or stationary bicycle) exer-
cise test, while also performing ventilatory gas 
exchange measurements.28 CPET enables the 
comprehensive assessment of multiple physiologi-
cal measures that can impact exercise capacity and 
contribute to dyspnea. It provides analysis of gas 
exchange and yields measures of oxygen uptake 
(VO2), carbon dioxide output, and ventilation. These 
measures can be integrated with standard exercise 
testing variables, such as heart rate, blood pres-
sure, electrocardiographic findings, and symptoms 
to provide insights into the physiologic mechanisms 
underlying a patient’s dyspnea. In particular, CPET 
can help to distinguish respiratory versus cardiac 
etiologies of dyspnea. If exercise capacity is dimin-
ished but cardiopulmonary responses are normal, 
other causes of dyspnea, such as metabolic abnor-
malities and deconditioning, should be considered.

2a B-NR1. In ambulatory or hospitalized patients with HF, 
validated multivariable risk scores can be useful 
to estimate subsequent risk of mortality.1–14
Synopsis
Clinicians should routinely assess a patient’s risk for an 
adverse outcome to guide discussions on prognosis, 
goals of care, and treatment decisions. Several predictive 
models of outcomes of patients with HF have been de-
veloped and validated using data from clinical trials, regis-
tries, and population-based cohorts. The best performing 
models have focused on predicting short- and long-term 
mortality, whereas predictive models for hospitalization or 
readmission for HF have generally had poor or modest 
discrimination. Predictive models may also assess the risk 
of incident HF among the general population and should 
be considered in the prevention of HF. In the course of 
standard evaluation, clinicians should routinely assess the 
patient’s potential for adverse outcome, because accurate risk stratification may help guide therapeutic decision-
making, including a more rapid transition to advanced 
HF therapies. Several methods objectively assess risk 
(Table 8), including biomarker testing, as well as various

Synopsis
Healthy lifestyle habits such as maintaining regular phys-
ical activity; normal weight, blood pressure, and blood 
glucose levels; healthy dietary patterns, and not smok-
ing reduce primordial risk and have been associated with 
a lower lifetime risk of developing HF.13–21,27 The AHA/ACC primary prevention guidelines provide recommen-
dations for diet, physical activity, and weight control, all 
of which have been associated with the risk of HF.28 
Blood pressure is an important risk factor for HF, and a 
treatment goal of <130/80 mm Hg is recommended for 
those with a CVD risk of ≥10%.29,30 Multiple RCTs have 
found that patients with diabetes and CVD without HF 
have improved survival and reduced HF hospitalizations 
with SGL T2i.31 Patients at risk for HF screened with BNP 
or NT-proBNP followed by collaborative care, diagnostic 
evaluation, and treatment in those with elevated levels 
can reduce combined rates of L V systolic dysfunction, 
diastolic dysfunction, and HF.22,23 See Figure 5 for COR 1

1. Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure are 
major risk factors for the development of symp-
tomatic HF.8,9,32 Many trials have shown that hyper-
tension control reduces the risk of HF.1–7 Although 
the magnitude of benefit varies with the patient 
population, target blood pressure reduction, and 
HF criteria, effective hypertension treatment invari-
ably reduces HF events. In the SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) trial, control to 
an SBP goal <120 mm Hg decreased incident 
HF by 38% and mortality by 23% compared with 
an SBP goal of <140 mm Hg6,7 A meta-analysis 
showed that blood pressure control was associ-
ated with an approximately 40% reduction in HF

sure should be controlled in accordance with pub-
lished clinical practice guidelines.30
2. Multiple RCTs in patients with type 2 diabetes and 
at risk for, or with established CVD or at high risk for 
CVD, have shown that SGL T2i prevent HF hospital-
izations compared with placebo.10–12 The benefit for 
reducing HF hospitalizations in these trials predomi-
nantly reflects primary prevention of symptomatic HF, 
because only approximately 10% to 14% of partici-
pants in these trials had HF at baseline. The mecha-
nisms for the improvement in HF events have not 
been clearly elucidated but seem to be independent 
of glucose lowering. Proposed mechanisms include 
reductions in plasma volume, cardiac preload and 
afterload, alterations in cardiac metabolism, reduced 
arterial stiffness, and interaction with the Na+/H+ 
exchanger.33,34 SGL T2i are generally well tolerated, 
but these agents have not been evaluated in those 
with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate [eGFR] <25 mL/min/1.73 m2).35

5. Incident HF may be predicted from different mod-
els, including those derived from diverse populations 
(Table 9). The PCP-HF (Pooled Cohort equations 
to Prevent HF) model provides race- and sex-
specific 10-year risk equations from 7 community-
based cohorts with at least 12 years of follow-up.29 
Predictors of HF included in the race- and sex-spe-
cific models were age, blood pressure (treated or 
untreated), fasting glucose (treated or untreated), 
body mass index, cholesterol, smoking status, and 
QRS duration. Models can be applied to the clinical 
setting of interest, with clinical trial models potentially 
less generalizable to registry- or population-based 
models. In addition, predictive models provide the 
average estimate of risk derived from a population, 
and individual risk may vary.36 The integration of risk 
scores into clinical practice have shown improved 
outcomes. As data generation increases from elec-
tronic health records and digital sources, advanced 
methods with machine learning are expected to pro-
liferate the development of risk prediction models. 
Machine learning models are often not externally 
validated, and their performance may vary based on 
the population and clinical setting.37 Patient popula-
tions change over time, and models may need to be 
recalibrated periodically.

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplements.
COR LOE Recommendations
1 A1. In patients with LVEF ≤40%, ACEi should be

MI or ACS, statins should be used to prevent 
symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular

or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and LVEF 
≤40%, evidence-based beta blockers should 
be used to reduce mortality.11–13
1 B-R5. In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI 
with LVEF ≤30% and NYHA class I symptoms 
while receiving GDMT and have reasonable 
expectation of meaningful survival for >1 year, 
an ICD is recommended for primary prevention 
of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total 
mortality.14

should be used to prevent symptomatic HF.12,13
3: Harm B-R7 . In patients with LVEF <50%, thiazolidinediones 
should not be used because they increase the 
risk of HF, including hospitalizations.15

dine calcium channel blockers with negative 
inotropic effects may be harmful.16,17
Synopsis
In general, all recommendations for patients with stage 
A HF also apply to those with stage B HF. Stage B (pre-
HF) represents a phase of clinically asymptomatic struc-
tural and functional cardiac abnormalities that increases 
the risk for symptomatic HF.18–21 Identifying individu-
als with stage B HF provides an opportunity to initiate 
lifestyle modification and pharmacological therapy that 
may prevent or delay the transition to symptomatic HF 
(stage C/D). Several ACC/AHA clinical practice guide-
lines address appropriate management of patients with 
stage B HF (Table 10). Although multiple studies high-
light the increased HF risk associated with asymptomatic 
L V systolic19,20,22–26 and diastolic dysfunction identified by 
noninvasive imaging,19,26–30 beneficial pharmacotherapy 
for asymptomatic L V systolic dysfunction, such as inhibi-
tors of the renin-angiotensin system and beta blockers, 
have been predominantly observed in individuals with 
depressed L VEF (L VEF <35%–40%).1–4,11–13 Studies of 
specific treatments to alter the onset of HF in the set-
ting of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction with preserved 
L VEF (eg, abnormalities of myocardial deformation or 
diastolic dysfunction) have been limited. Several comor-
bid conditions, including diabetes, obesity, and hyperten-
sion, have been associated with asymptomatic L V dys-
function27 ,28,30,31 and with progression of asymptomatic 
L V dysfunction to symptomatic HF.27 Accordingly, these 
comorbidities are controlled according to current clinical Table 9. Selected Multivariable Risk Scores to Predict De-

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. ACEi have been shown to impede maladaptive remod-
eling after acute MI in patients with reduced L VEF.36,37 
In survivors of acute MI with asymptomatic L V dys-
function (L VEF <35%–40%), RCTs have shown 
that ACEi reduced mortality, HF hospitalizations, and 
progression to severe HF compared with placebo.2,4 
Similarly, in those individuals with asymptomatic L V 
dysfunction in the SOL VD (Studies of Left Ventricular 
Systolic Dysfunction) prevention trial, which included 
approximately 20% without ischemic heart disease, 
enalapril was associated with reduced HF hospitaliza-
tion and mortality compared with placebo.1,3
2. In multiple RCTs,42 statins have been shown to pre-
vent adverse CAD events in patients with an MI, 
ACS, and with high cardiovascular risk. These trials 
have also shown that statin therapy reduces the 
risk of incident HF.5–9 A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs 
of >110 000 patients with an ACS showed that 
intensive statin therapy reduced hospitalizations 
for HF.5 A subsequent, larger collaborative meta-
analysis of up to 17 major primary and secondary 
prevention RCTs showed that statins reduced HF hospitalization.42 These data support the use of 
statins to prevent symptomatic HF and cardiovas-
cular events in patients with acute MI or ACS.
3. Two major trials have compared ARB with ACEi after 
MI. The VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial 
Infarction) trial, which included approximately 25% of 
patients with asymptomatic L V dysfunction, showed 
that the benefits of valsartan on mortality and other 
adverse cardiovascular outcomes were compa-
rable to captopril.10,38 In the OPTIMAAL (Optimal 
Trial in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin 
II Antagonist Losartan) trial, losartan did not meet 
the noninferiority criteria for mortality compared with 
captopril.39 It has been hypothesized that the lower 
dose of losartan (50 mg daily) in the OPTIMAAL 
trial may have contributed to the greater differ-
ence than those seen with valsartan in VALIANT.40 
No clinical trials have specifically evaluated ARB in 
patients with asymptomatic reduced L VEF in the 
absence of previous MI. Although ARB are alterna-
tives for patients with ACEi-induced angioedema, 
caution is advised because some patients have also 
developed angioedema with ARB.
4. Current evidence supports the use of beta block-
ers to improve adverse cardiac remodeling and 
outcomes in patients with asymptomatic reduced 
L VEF after MI. Among patients with a recent MI 
and reduced L VEF, carvedilol reduced maladaptive 
remodeling41 and reduced mortality compared with 
placebo.11 Among patients with asymptomatic L V 
systolic dysfunction in the SOL VD prevention trial 
(which included 80% with previous MI) and the 
SAVE (Survival and Ventricular Enlargement) trial, 
secondary analyses showed that the administra-
tion of beta blockers in addition to ACEi reduced 
mortality and hospitalization.12,13Table 10. Other ACC/AHA Clinical Practice Guidelines Addressing Patients With Stage B HF

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline5. The Framingham studies have shown a 60% 
increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic 
low L VEF compared with those with normal L VEF, 
and almost half of these patients remained free 
of HF before their death.25 MADIT-II (Multicenter 
Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II) showed 
a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality 
in patients with post-MI with L VEF ≤ 30% receiv-
ing a prophylactic ICD compared with standard 
of care.14 These findings provided justification for 
the broad adoption of ICDs for primary prevention 
of SCD in the post-MI setting with reduced L VEF, 
even in the absence of HF symptoms.
6. Although beta blockers have been shown to improve 
outcomes in patients with symptomatic HFrEF and 
in patients with reduced L VEF after MI,11 few data 
exist regarding the use of beta blockers in asymp-
tomatic patients with depressed L VEF without a his-
tory of MI. There is evidence to support the role of 
beta blockers to prevent adverse L V remodeling in 
asymptomatic patients with L V systolic dysfunction, 
including those with nonischemic cause.43 Also, in 
a post hoc analysis of the SOL VD prevention trial, 
which included approximately 20% of participants 
with nonischemic HF cause, beta blockers were 
associated with a reduction in the risk of death and 
in death or hospitalization for symptomatic HF in 
those patients randomized to enalapril, a finding that 
was not seen in the placebo group.12 Given the long-
term benefits of beta blockers to reduce HF hos-
pitalizations in patients with symptomatic HFrEF,44 
beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent 
symptomatic HF in patients with reduced L VEF.
7 . Thiazolidinediones have been associated with fluid 
retention and increased rates of HF in RCTs of 
patients with type 2 diabetes who were predominantly 
free of symptomatic HF at baseline.47–49 In a smaller 
RCT of patients with more severely symptomatic 
HFrEF, pioglitazone was associated with increased 
rates of HF hospitalization compared with placebo.50 
In patients with more mild symptoms (NYHA class 
I to II) but with depressed L VEF,15 rosiglitazone was 
associated with more fluid-related events, includ-
ing worsening edema and need for increased HF 
medications.15 Given the evidence, thiazolidinediones 
should be avoided in patients with reduced L VEF.
8. Nondihydropiridine calcium channel blockers diltia-
zem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and 
generally not tolerated in HF. In previous studies of 
patients with HF or reduced L VEF after acute MI, dil-
tiazem was associated with increased risk of HF,16,17 
although in a smaller study of patients with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy, diltiazem had no impact 
on mortality.45 Verapamil had no impact on survival 
or major cardiovascular events after acute MI.46 
Although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low L VEF, nondihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers may be harmful in this population 
because of their negative inotropic effects.

Synopsis
Because of the complexity of HF management and 
coordination of other health and social services re-
quired, HF care is ideally provided by multidisciplinary 
teams27–30 that include cardiologists, nurses, and phar-
macists who specialize in HF as well as dieticians, 
mental health clinicians, social workers, primary care 
clinicians, and additional specialists.31–33 Self-care in 
HF comprises treatment adherence and health main-
tenance behaviors.34,35 Patients with HF should learn to 
take medications as prescribed, restrict sodium intake, 
stay physically active, and get vaccinations.36,37 They 
also should understand how to monitor for signs and 
symptoms of worsening HF, and what to do in response 
to symptoms when they occur.36,37 Knowledge alone 
is insufficient to improve self-care.38 Patients with HF 
need time and support to gain skills and overcome bar-
riers to effective self-care.37 Measures listed as Class 
1 recommendations for patients in stages A and B are 
recommended where appropriate for patients in stage 
C. GDMT, as depicted in Figure 6, should be the main-
stay of pharmacological therapy for HFrEF.

ventions focused on improving HF self-care significantly reduce the risk of HF-related hos-

mobile health–delivered educational interven-

PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNi

significant reductions in all-cause mortality and car-
diovascular mortality12 in 1 registry study and was 
associated with significant reductions in all-cause 
mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality 
and cardiovascular hospitalizations in another large 
cohort study.11 In a self-controlled case series study 
of patients with HF, influenza vaccination was asso-
ciated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovas-
cular, respiratory, and all-cause hospitalization.43 In 
a meta-analysis of 16 studies of patients with CVD, 
influenza vaccination was associated with a lower 
risk of all-cause, cardiovascular mortality, and major 
adverse cardiovascular events compared with con-
trol patients.15 In the Cardiovascular Health Study, 
pneumococcal vaccination was associated with sig-

are uniquely susceptible to poor outcomes in the

poor HF self-care.36,37 (Table 11) but have also been 
linked to poor clinical outcomes and fundamen-
tally change how education and support must be

care,40 rehospitalization,17 and all-cause mortality18 
among patients with HF. Interventions that focus 
on improving HF self-care have been reported 
to be effective among patients with moderate/
severe depression with reductions in hospitaliza-
tion and mortality risk.5 Nonrandomized studies 
have provided evidence of a link between social 
isolation and mortality in patients with HF19,20 In a 
recent meta-analysis of 29 cohort studies, frailty 
was associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
mortality and hospitalization.23 Frailty also has been 
shown to impair self-care among elderly patients 
with HF.24 A recent meta-analysis of observational 
studies revealed social isolation to be common 
among adults with HF (ie, 37%) and associated 
with a 55% greater risk of HF-related rehospital-
ization.21 Poor social support also has been shown 
in nonrandomized studies to be associated with 
lower HF self-care.22 A recent meta-analysis of 
observational studies showed that inadequate/marginal health literacy is common among adults 
with HF (ie, 24%) and associated independently 
with the risk of mortality and hospitalization.25 Low 
literacy also is associated with poor HF self-care, 
as most interventions depend on both literacy and 
health literacy/numeracy.26
7.1.2. Dietary Sodium Restriction
Recommendation for Dietary Sodium Restriction
COR LOE Recommendation
2a C-LD1. For patients with stage C HF, avoiding exces-
sive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce 
congestive symptoms.1–6
Synopsis
Restricting dietary sodium is a common nonpharmaco-
logical treatment for patients with HF symptomatic with 
congestion, but specific recommendations have been 
based on low-quality evidence.7 Concerns about the qual-
ity of data regarding clinical benefits or harm of sodium 
restriction in patients with HF include the lack of current 
pharmacological therapy, small samples without sufficient 
racial and ethnic diversity, questions about the correct 
threshold for clinical benefit, uncertainty about which sub-
groups benefit most from sodium restriction,7, 8 and seri-
ous questions about the validity of several RCTs in this 
area.9–11 However, there are promising pilot trials of so-
dium restriction in patients with HF3,5,6 The AHA currently 
recommends a reduction of sodium intake to <2300 
mg/d for general cardiovascular health promotion12; how-
ever, there are no trials to support this level of restriction 
in patients with HF.13 Sodium restriction can result in poor 
dietary quality with inadequate macronutrient and mi-
cronutrient intake.14 Nutritional inadequacies have been 
associated with clinical instability,15–17 but routine supple-
mentation of oral iron,18 thiamine,19 zinc,20 vitamin D,21 or 
multivitamins has not proven beneficial.22 The DASH diet 
is rich in antioxidants and potassium, can achieve sodium 
restriction without compromising nutritional adequacy 
when accompanied by dietary counseling,5 and may be 
associated with reduced hospitalizations for HF.23

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure GuidelineSynopsis
Exercise training in patients with HF is safe and has 
numerous benefits. In a major trial of exercise and HF, 
exercise training was associated with a reduction in 
CVD mortality or hospitalizations in the exercise train-
ing group after adjustment for risk factors.1 Meta-anal-
yses show that cardiac rehabilitation improves func-
tional capacity, exercise duration, and health-related 
QOL. A cardiac rehabilitation program for patients 
with HF usually includes a medical evaluation, educa-
tion regarding the importance of medical adherence, 
dietary recommendations, psychosocial support, and 
an exercise training and physical activity counseling 
program. Patients with HF on optimal GDMT, who are 
in stable medical condition and are able to participate 
in an exercise program, are candidates for an exercise 
rehabilitation program.10,11
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Evidence from RCTs indicates that exercise training 
improves functional status, exercise performance, 
and QOL in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. In 
HF-ACTION, the largest randomized trial with exer-
cise training in patients with HF,1 2331 patients 
with L VEF ≤35% (NYHA class II and III) were ran-
domized to usual care versus supervised exercise 
training plus usual care. There were modest reduc-
tions in all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates 
that did not reach significance by primary analysis 
but, after prespecified adjustment, were associated 
with reductions in cardiovascular mortality or HF 
hospitalizations.1 Many RCTs of exercise training in 
HF have been conducted, but the statistical power 
of most was low.2–5,9–13 Meta-analyses suggest that 
exercise training is associated with improvement 
in functional capacity, exercise duration, health-
related QOL, and reduction in HF hospitalizations 
in patients with HFrEF as well as HFpEF.2–6,8,11,14,15 
Most studies and meta-analyses have not shown 
significant changes in all-cause mortality.2,12,14–22 
except for a few showing mortality benefit with 
longer follow-up6,7 Other benefits of exercise train-
ing include improved endothelial function, blunted 
catecholamine spillover, increased peripheral oxy-
gen extraction, and improvement in peak oxygen 
consumption.2–5,8,10–12,21
2. A formal cardiac rehabilitation program usually 
includes a medical evaluation, education regard-
ing the importance of medical adherence, dietary 
recommendations, psychosocial support, and an 
exercise training and physical activity counseling 
program. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation 
has been associated with an improvement in func-
tional capacity, exercise tolerance, the rate of over-
all and HF-specific hospitalization, and improved QOL.3,4,6,7 ,11,16,17 In a diverse population of older 
patients who were hospitalized for acute decom-
pensated HF, an early, transitional, tailored, pro-
gressive rehabilitation intervention that included 
multiple physical-function domains (strength, bal-
ance, mobility, and endurance) initiated during, or 
early after hospitalization for HF, and continued 
after discharge, resulted in greater improvement in 
physical function than usual care.9
7 .2. Diuretics and Decongestion Strategies in 
Patients With HF
Recommendations for Diuretics and Decongestion Strategies in  
Patients With HF
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are  
summarized in the Online Data Supplements.
COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-NR1. In patients with HF who have fluid retention, 
diuretics are recommended to relieve conges-
tion, improve symptoms, and prevent worsen-
ing HF.1–5
1 B-NR2. For patients with HF and congestive symptoms, 
addition of a thiazide (eg, metolazone) to treat-
ment with a loop diuretic should be reserved 
for patients who do not respond to moderate- 
or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electro-
lyte abnormalities.6
Synopsis
Bumetanide, furosemide, and torsemide inhibit reabsorp-
tion of sodium or chloride at the loop of Henle, whereas 
thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics act in the distal con-
voluting tubule and potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spi-
ronolactone) in the collecting duct.7, 8 Loop diuretics are 
the preferred diuretic agents for use in most patients 
with HF. Thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or 
hydrochlorothiazide may be considered in patients with 
hypertension and HF and mild fluid retention. Metola-
zone or chlorothiazide may be added to loop diuretics in 
patients with refractory edema unresponsive to loop di-
uretics alone. Diuretics should be prescribed to patients 
who have evidence of congestion or fluid retention. In 
any patient with a history of congestion, maintenance 
diuretics should be considered to avoid recurrent symp-
toms. The treatment goal of diuretic use is to eliminate 
clinical evidence of fluid retention, using the lowest dose 
possible to maintain euvolemia. With the exception of 
MRAs, the effects of diuretics on morbidity and mortality 
are uncertain.1–5 As such, diuretics should not be used 
in isolation but always combined with other GDMT for 
HF that reduces hospitalizations and prolongs survival. 
Table 12 lists oral diuretics recommended for use in the 
treatment of chronic HF. Hyponatremia complicates HF 
management. If reversing potential causes and free wa-
ter restriction do not improve hyponatremia, vasopressin 
antagonists may be helpful in the acute management of

1. Controlled trials with diuretics showed their effects 
to increase urinary sodium excretion, decrease 
physical signs of fluid retention, and improve 
symptoms, QOL, and exercise tolerance.1–5 Recent 
data from the nonrandomized OPTIMIZE-HF 
(Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment 
in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) regis-
try revealed reduced 30-day all-cause mortality 
and hospitalization for HF with diuretic use com-
pared with no diuretic use after hospital discharge 
for HF.9 The most commonly used loop diuretic 
for the treatment of HF is furosemide, but some 
patients respond more favorably to other agents in 
this category (eg, bumetanide, torsemide), poten-
tially because of their increased oral bioavailabil-
ity.10–12 In outpatients with HF, diuretic therapy is 
commonly initiated with low doses, and the dose 
is increased until urine output increases and 
weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily. 
Patients may become unresponsive to high doses 
of diuretic drugs if they consume large amounts of 
dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block 
the effects of diuretics (eg, NSAIDs), or have sig-
nificant impairment of renal function or perfusion.
2. Diuretic resistance can be overcome in several 
ways, including escalation of loop diuretic dose, 
intravenous administration of diuretics (bolus or 
continuous infusion),6 or combination of different 
diuretic classes.13–16 The use of a thiazide or thia-
zide-like diuretic (eg, metolazone) in combination 
with a loop diuretic inhibits compensatory distal 
tubular sodium reabsorption, leading to enhanced natriuresis. However, in a propensity-score 
matched analysis in patients with hospitalized HF, 
the addition of metolazone to loop diuretics was 
found to increase the risk for hypokalemia, hypo-
natremia, worsening renal function, and mortality, 
whereas use of higher doses of loop diuretics was 
not found to adversely affect survival.17 Although 
randomized data comparing the 2 diuretic strate-
gies are limited, the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization 
Strategies Evaluation) trial lends support for the 
use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretics.18

because of improvement in morbidity and mortality.1–5 An 
ARNi is recommended as de novo treatment in hospital-
ized patients with acute HF before discharge given im-
provement in health status, reduction in the prognostic 
biomarker NT-proBNP, and improvement of L V remodel-
ing parameters compared with ACEi/ARB. Although data 
are limited, the use of an ARNi may be efficacious as 
de novo treatment in patients with symptomatic chronic 
HFrEF to simplify management. ARB may be used as 
an alternative to ACEi in the setting of intolerable cough, 
or as alternatives to ACEi and ARNi in patients with a 
history of angioedema. If patients are switched from an 
ACEi to an ARNi or vice versa, there should be at least 
36 hours between ACEi and ARNi doses.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. An ARNi is composed of an ARB and an inhibi-
tor of neprilysin, an enzyme that degrades natri-
uretic peptides, bradykinin, adrenomedullin, and 
other vasoactive peptides. In PARADIGM-HF 
(Prospective Comparison of ARNi with ACEi 
to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and 
Morbidity in Heart Failure), an RCT that compared 
the first approved ARNi, sacubitril-valsartan, with 
enalapril in symptomatic patients with HFrEF tol-
erating an adequate dose of either ACEi or ARB, 
sacubitril-valsartan significantly reduced the com-
posite endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF 
hospitalization by 20% relative to enalapril.1 The 
benefit was observed to a similar extent for death 
and HF hospitalization and was consistent across 
prespecified subgroups.1 Use of an ARNi is more 
frequently associated with symptomatic hypoten-
sion and a comparable incidence of angioedema 
when compared with enalapril.1 Sacubitril-valsartan 
has been approved for patients with symptomatic 
HF. HF effects and potential off-target effects 
may be complex with inhibition of the neprily-
sin enzyme, which has multiple biological targets. 
Trial data have included ACEi/ARB-naïve patients 
before ARNi initiation (53% in the PIONEER-HF 
[Comparison of Sacubitril-Valsartan versus 
Enalapril on Effect on NT-proBNP in Patients 
Stabilized from an Acute Heart Failure Episode] 
trial and 24% in the TRANSITION [Comparison 
of Pre- and Post-discharge Initiation of Sacubitril/
Valsartan Therapy in HFrEF Patients After an 
Acute Decompensation Event] trial) and have 
shown similar efficacy and safety in treatment-
naïve patients.2,3 The PIONEER-HF trial showed 
that ARNi reduced NT-proBNP levels in patients 
hospitalized for acute decompensated HF without 
increased rates of adverse events (worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, 
angioedema) when compared with enalapril.3 
Additional outcome analyses suggested reduction 
in all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for HF 
but were only hypothesis-generating as exploratory 
study endpoints. In the open-label TRANSITION 
trial, patients with HFrEF hospitalized with wors-
ening HF were randomized to start ARNi either 
before or after discharge.2 Safety outcomes were 
similar for both arms, suggesting that early initia-
tion may simplify management (rather than initiat-
ing and uptitrating ACEi first and then switching to 
ARNi).2 ARNi should be initiated de novo in patients 
hospitalized with acute HFrEF before discharge in 
the absence of contraindications. ARNi may be ini-
tiated de novo in patients with chronic symptom-
atic HFrEF to simplify management, although data 
are limited. The PARADISE-MI (Prospective ARNi 
vs ACE Inhibitor Trial to DetermIne Superiority in 
Reducing Heart Failure Events After MI) trial40 will 
provide information on whether sacubitril-valsartan 
will significantly reduce the rate of cardiovascular 
death, HF hospitalization or outpatient HF requir-
ing treatment in patients after acute MI, with L VEF 
≤40% and/or pulmonary congestion, and 1 of 8 
additional risk-enhancing factors like AF, previous 
MI, diabetes, compared with the ACEi ramipril; and 
whether the safety and tolerability of sacubitril-val-
sartan was comparable to that of ramipril. Thus, at 
the present time, the efficacy of ARNi in patients 
with L V dysfunction, and HF in the early post-MI 
period, remains uncertain.
2. ACEi reduce morbidity and mortality in HFrEF. RCTs 
clearly establish the benefits of ACE inhibition in 
patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms 
of HF and in patients with or without CAD.6–11 Data 
suggest that there are no differences among avail-
able ACEi in their effects on symptoms or survival.12 
ACEi should be started at low doses and titrated 
upward to doses shown to reduce the risk of car-
diovascular events in clinical trials. ACEi can pro-
duce angioedema and should be given with caution 
to patients with low systemic blood pressures, renal 
insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (>5.0 
mEq/L). If maximal doses are not tolerated, inter-
mediate doses should be tried; abrupt withdrawal of 
ACE inhibition can lead to clinical deterioration and 
should be avoided. Although the use of an ARNi 
in lieu of an ACEi for HFrEF has been found to be 
superior, for those patients for whom ARNi is inap-
propriate, continued use of an ACEi for all classes 
of HFrEF remains strongly advised.
3. ARB have been shown to reduce mortality and 
HF hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF in 
large RCTs.14–16 Long-term treatment with ARB

with those expected after interference with the 
renin-angiotensin system.17 ,18 Unlike ACEi, ARB 
do not inhibit kininase and are associated with a 
much lower incidence of cough and angioedema, 
although kininase inhibition by ACEi may produce 
beneficial vasodilatory effects. Patients who are 
intolerant to ACEi because of cough or angio-
edema should be started on an ARB. ARB should 
be started at low doses and titrated upward, with an 
attempt to use doses shown to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events in clinical trials. ARB should 
be given with caution to patients with low systemic 
blood pressure, renal insufficiency, or elevated 
serum potassium (>5.0 mEq/L). Although ARB are 
alternatives for patients with ACEi-induced angio-
edema, caution is advised because some patients 
have also developed angioedema with ARB. For 
those patients for whom an ACEi or ARNi is inap-
propriate, use of an ARB remains advised.
4. Several cost-effectiveness analyses consistently 
found that ACEi therapy provides high value for 
patients with chronic HF. A model-based analysis, 
using generic ACEi costs, found ACEi therapy was 
high value.19 Previous analyses also found ACEi 
therapy was high value despite previously higher 
ACEi costs.19,21,22,24,25 This includes a trial-based 
analysis of SOL VD (Studies of Left Ventricular 
Dysfunction) that modeled long-term outcomes.21 
Previous analyses included a range of clinical sce-
narios including asymptomatic L V dysfunction24 
and L V dysfunction after MI,25 with ACEi therapy 
providing high value in each. There are limited data 
on the cost-effectiveness of ARBs from 2 clinical 
trials—a within-trial analysis of Val-HeFT (Valsartan 
Heart Failure Trial)23 and an analysis of the ELITE 
(Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly) study20—
which both suggested ARB therapy is high value. 
The high value of ARB therapy is also supported 
by its similar efficacy as ACEi therapy and the 
low-cost generic availability for both medication 
classes.
5. Patients with chronic stable HFrEF who toler-
ate ACEi and ARB should be switched to ARNi. 
In patients with mild-to-moderate HF who were 
able to tolerate both a target dose of enalapril (10 
mg twice daily) and then subsequently an ARNi 
(sacubitril-valsartan; 200 mg twice daily, with the 
ARB component equivalent to valsartan 160 mg), 
hospitalizations and mortality were significantly 
decreased with the valsartan-sacubitril compound 
compared with enalapril.1 Another RCT and meta-
analysis showed improvement in L V remodeling 
parameters with ARNi compared with enalapril.4,5
6. Multiple model-based analyses evaluated the eco-
nomic value of ARNi therapy compared with ACEi therapy using the results of PARADIGM-HF.26–29,41 
Three high-quality analyses26,28,29 consistently 
found costs per QAL Y <$60 000, which provides 
high value according to the benchmarks adopted 
for the current clinical practice guideline. These 
results were robust to the range of sacubitril-val-
sartan costs currently seen in care. These results 
were sensitive to the estimated mortality reduc-
tion and duration of treatment effectiveness. ARNi 
would need to maintain effectiveness beyond the 
PARADIGM-HF study period (mean, 27 months) 
to be considered high value.29 If clinical benefit 
were limited to 27 months, ARNi would be inter-
mediate value. One additional analysis, based on 
the PIONEER-HF trial, found that inpatient initia-
tion of ARNi was also high value compared with 
delayed initiation postdischarge.27
7 . Oral neprilysin inhibitors, used in combination with 
ACEi, can lead to angioedema, and concomitant 
use is contraindicated and should be avoided. A 
medication that represented a neprilysin inhibitor 
and an ACEi—omapatrilat—was studied in hyper-
tension and HF, but its development was termi-
nated because of an unacceptable incidence of 
angioedema.30,31 and associated significant mor-
bidity. This adverse effect was thought to occur 
because ACEi and neprilysin break down brady-
kinin, which can directly or indirectly cause angio-
edema31,32 An ARNi should not be administered 
within 36 hours of switching from or to an ACEi.
8. Omapatrilat, a neprilysin inhibitor (as well as an 
ACEi and aminopeptidase P inhibitor), was asso-
ciated with a higher frequency of angioedema 
than that seen with enalapril in an RCT of patients 
with HFrEF.30 In a very large RCT of hyperten-
sive patients, omapatrilat was associated with a 
3-fold increased risk of angioedema compared 
with enalapril.31 Black patients and patients who 
smoked were particularly at risk. The high inci-
dence of angioedema ultimately led to cessation 
of the clinical development of omapatrilat.33,34 
Because of these observations, angioedema was 
an exclusion criterion in the first large trial assess-
ing ARNi therapy in patients with hypertension35 
and then in the large trial that showed clinical ben-
efit of ARNi therapy in HFrEF.1 The rates of angio-
edema were numerically higher in patients treated 
with ARNi than in patients treated with ACEi in 
PARADIGM-HF, although this difference did not 
reach significance.1 ARNi therapy should not be 
administered in patients with a history of angio-
edema because of the concern that it will increase 
the risk of a recurrence of angioedema.

Synopsis
Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death 
and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in pa-
tients with HFrEF.1–3 In addition, this treatment can im-
prove L VEF, lessen the symptoms of HF, and improve 
clinical status.1–3,9–11 Clinical trials have shown that 
beta blockers should be prescribed to all patients when 
HFrEF is diagnosed, including in-hospital, unless contra-
indicated or not tolerated.1–3,9–11 These benefits of beta 
blockers were observed in patients with or without CAD, 
and in patients with or without diabetes, older patients, 
as well as in women and across racial and ethnic groups 
but not in patients with AF.1–3,10–12 Even if symptoms do 
not improve, long-term treatment should be maintained 
to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Beta 
blockers should be initiated at low doses, and every ef-
fort should be made to achieve the target doses of the 
beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical tri-

Sequencing and Uptitration”).

1. Three beta blockers have been shown to be effec-
tive in reducing the risk of death in patients with 
HFrEF: bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol 
(succinate), and carvedilol.1–3 The favorable find-
ings with these 3 agents, however, should not be 
considered a beta-blocker class effect in HFrEF. 
Other beta blockers are not included in this rec-
ommendation for use.13–15 Even when asymptom-
atic, or when symptoms are mild or improve with 
other therapies, beta-blocker therapy is important 
and should not be delayed until symptoms return or 
disease progression is documented.16 Data show 
that beta blockers can be safely initiated before hospital discharge, provided patients are clinically 
stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic 
therapy for HF.17 If a contraindication or intoler-
ance are noted, they should be documented, and 
the patient restarted on beta-blocker therapy in the 
future, so long as an absolute contraindication is 
not present. Even if symptoms or L VEF improve, 
long-term treatment with beta blockers and use of 
target doses should be maintained to reduce the 
risk of progression in L V dysfunction or major car-
diovascular events.18,19 Abrupt withdrawal of beta-
blocker therapy can lead to clinical deterioration 
and should be avoided unless indicated.18
2. Multiple analyses have shown the high value of 
beta-blocker therapy among HF patients. A model-
based analysis, using generic beta-blocker costs, 
found beta-blocker therapy was high value.4 These 
results were consistent with earlier model-based 
cost-effectiveness analyses5–7 and a trial-based 
economic analysis of the US Carvedilol Heart 
Failure (CHF) Trials Program.8 Each of these stud-
ies also found treatment with a beta blocker was 
high value despite using previously higher beta-
blocker costs.

1 A1. In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV 
symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplere-
none) is recommended to reduce morbidity and 
mortality, if eGFR is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
serum potassium is <5.0 mEq/L. Careful moni-
toring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic 
dosing should be performed at initiation and

Synopsis
MRA (also known as aldosterone antagonists or anti-min-
eralocorticoids) show consistent improvements in all-cause 
mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD across a wide range 
of patients with HFrEF.1–3 Patients at risk for renal dysfunc-
tion or hyperkalemia require close monitoring, and eGFR 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L 
are contraindications to MRA initiation.10,11 Because of the 
higher selectivity of eplerenone for the aldosterone receptor,

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Clinical trials taken on MRA together—RALES 
(Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study)1 ran-
domized highly symptomatic patients with L VEF 
≤35%; EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post–Acute 
Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and 
Survival Study)2 randomized patients post-MI with 
L VEF ≤40%; and EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in 
Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study 
in Heart Failure)3 randomized patients with mild 
symptoms and L VEF ≤30%—suggest a benefit of 
MRA across the spectrum of HFrEF, inclusive of 
a wide range of etiologies and disease severities. 
Initiation in the ambulatory or hospital setting is 
appropriate.12 The starting dose of spironolactone 
and eplerenone is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 
50 mg daily orally after a month; for eGFR 31 to 
49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced 
by half. Regular checks of serum potassium levels 
and renal function should be performed accord-
ing to clinical status, approximately 1 week, then 4 
weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or inten-
sifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical 
instability. We elected to remove the 2013 recom-
mendation “Aldosterone receptor antagonists are 
recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality 
following an acute MI in patients who have L VEF of 
40% or less who develop symptoms of HF or who 
have a history of diabetes mellitus, unless contrain-
dicated” because the new recommendation covers 
the spectrum of symptomatic patients with HF.
2. The economic value of MRA therapy was assessed 
by both RCTs (RALES5 and EPHESUS6,7) and a 
model-based analysis.4 The model-based analysis 
used generic MRA costs and found therapy was 
high value with a cost per QAL Y of under $1000.4 
The earlier trial-based economic analyses of MRAs 
from RALES and EPHESUS also found MRA ther-
apy was high value despite using previously higher 
MRA costs.5–7
3. Spironolactone and eplerenone are partially 
excreted through the kidneys, raising concerns 
about safety when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2.10,11 Spironolactone and eplerenone decrease 
renal potassium excretion, raising the risk of 
hyperkalemia, particularly when MRA is initiated 
at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued 
≥5.5 mEq/L. The incidence of clinically significant 
hyperkalemia events was <1% in EPHESUS and 
EMPHASIS-HF, without a significant difference 
between eplerenone and placebo.2,3 however, in the 
closely monitored setting of a RCT with enrollment of younger patients with fewer multiple chronic 
conditions than seen in the general HFrEF popula-
tion, safety may be overstated. Observational data 
have raised concerns about less favorable out-
comes of MRA use for HFrEF during usual care.8,9 
Coadministration of MRA with ACEi or ARB mildly 
increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia 
risk was lower with ARNi in patients with chronic 
HF in the PARADIGM-HF trial13 but not different in 
patients with HF who were decompensated in the 
PIONEER-HF trial14 when compared with ACEi. 
Diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic ther-
apy interruption, because of worsening renal func-
tion or hyperkalemia, should be a consideration for 
temporarily holding the MRA. The development of 
worsening renal function or hyperkalemia is often 
a reflection of acute clinical change or progressive 
disease, prompting careful evaluation of the entire 
medical regimen and other causes of hyperkalemia, 
in addition to holding the MRA. The efficacy of the 
use of potassium binders (eg, patiromer, sodium zir-
conium cyclosilicate) to improve outcomes by facili-
tating continuation of MRA is uncertain15,16 and is 
addressed in Section 7 .3.6, “Other Drug Treatment.”

Value Statement: 
Intermediate Value 
(A)2. In patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, 
SGLT2i therapy provides intermediate eco-
nomic value.3,4
Synopsis
Several RCTs in patients with type 2 diabetes and ei-
ther established CVD or high risk for CVD have shown 
that SGL T2i prevent HF hospitalizations compared with 
placebo.5–7 The overall 31% reduction in HF hospitaliza-
tions was noted irrespective of the presence or absence 
of preexisting HF, although only 10% to 14% of par-
ticipants had HF at baseline. The benefit appears in-
dependent of the glucose-lowering effects.8 Therefore, 
several trials were launched to examine the efficacy of 
SGL T2i on outcomes in patients with HF, irrespective of 
the presence of type 2 diabetes. The DAPA-HF (Dapa-
gliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart 
Failure) trial and EMPEROR-Reduced (EMPagliflozin 
outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure 
With Reduced Ejection Fraction) showed the benefit of

or <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (DAPA-HF), type 1 diabetes, or 
lower SBP <95 to 100 mm Hg.

1. In the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced tri-
als, SGL T2i compared with placebo reduced the 
composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospi-
talization by approximately 25%.1,2,9 The benefit in 
reduction of HF hospitalization was greater (30%) 
in both trials.9 Risk of cardiovascular death was 
significantly lowered (18%) with dapagliflozin, as 
was risk of all-cause mortality (17%). Although 
no significant cardiovascular mortality benefit was 
observed with empagliflozin in a meta-analysis 
of DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials, 
SGL T2i therapy was associated with a reduction 
in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death.9 
The benefits in both trials were seen irrespective 
of baseline diabetes status. Furthermore, serious 
renal outcomes were less frequent, and the rate 
of decline in eGFR was slower in patients treated 
with SGL T2i.1,2,9 In the SOLOIST-WHF (Effect of 
Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients 
With T ype 2 Diabetes And Worsening Heart Failure) 
trial, patients with diabetes and HF hospitalization 
(79%: L VEF, <50%) were enrolled before dis-
charge or within 3 days of discharge. Sotagliflozin, 
a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporters 
1 and 2, reduced the combined endpoint of car-
diovascular death, HF hospitalization, or urgent 
HF visits by 33%10 but has not been approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 
2021. Although SGL T2i increased risk for genital 
infections, they were otherwise well tolerated in the 
trials. As the use of SGL T2i is translated into clini-
cal practice, caution is warranted for euglycemic 
ketoacidosis, genital and soft tissue infections, and 
adjustment of diuretics, if needed, to prevent vol-
ume depletion.11
2. Two model-based analyses evaluated the economic 
value of dapagliflozin therapy compared with usual 
care based on the results of the DAPA-HF trial.3,4 
Both analyses found costs per QAL Y between 
$60 000 and $90 000, which is consistent with 
intermediate value according to the benchmarks 
adopted for the current guideline. The results were 
most sensitive to the magnitude of cardiovascular 
mortality reduction, with a ≥8% reduction in cardio-
vascular mortality necessary for a cost per QAL Y 
below $150 000 in 1 study.3 There are a wide 
range of costs currently seen with dapagliflozin. These 2 analyses estimated a cost per QAL Y below 
$50 000 with annual dapagliflozin costs of $3240 
(43% reduction from main analysis) and $2500 
(40% reduction from main analysis), respectively.3,4 
A smaller reduction in drug cost would lead to a 
cost per QAL Y of under $60 000, the threshold for 
high value in this guideline.

can with NYHA class III to IV HFrEF who are

high economic value.3
2b C-LD3. In patients with current or previous symp-
tomatic HFrEF who cannot be given first-line 
agents, such as ARNi, ACEi, or ARB, because 
of drug intolerance or renal insufficiency, a 
combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dini-
trate might be considered to reduce morbidity 
and mortality.4,5
Synopsis
Two RCTs, V-HeFT I (Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial) 
and A-HeFT (African-American Heart Failure Trial), es-
tablished benefit of the combination of hydralazine-iso-
sorbide dinitrate in self-identified African Americans.2,4 
A-HeFT was terminated early because of evidence of 
remarkable benefit, but the result is vulnerable to a small 
number of events and the exigencies of early cessation 
of RCTs.2 The benefit in both trials was seen only at doses 
achieved in those trials that are higher than doses typi-
cally used in clinical practice and with short-acting nitrate 
therapy.2,4 Uptake of this regimen has been modest as a 
result of the complexity of the medical regimen and the 
array of drug-related adverse effects.5 Even when pre-
scribed, there is marked underusage based on very low 
prescription refill rates. Race-based medical therapy re-
mains a challenging issue, as well, with ongoing research 
now focused on biological hypotheses, particularly ab-
sence of European ancestry, which may be associated 
with responsiveness to this combination. There are insuf-
ficient data to guide the use of hydralazine-isosorbide 
dinitrate with ARNi. In patients with HFrEF who cannot 
receive first-line agents such as ARNi, ACEi, or ARB, re-
ferral to a HF specialist can provide guidance for further 
management because the use of hydralazine and isosor-
bide dinitrate in these patients is uncertain.

1. In a large-scale trial that compared the vasodila-
tor combination with placebo, the use of hydrala-
zine and isosorbide dinitrate reduced mortality in 
patients with HF treated with digoxin and diuretics 
but not an ACEi or beta blocker.4 However, in 2 
other trials that compared the vasodilator combina-
tion with an ACEi, the ACEi produced more favor-
able effects on survival.6,7 A post hoc retrospective 
analysis of these vasodilator trials showed particu-
lar efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine 
in the African American cohort.1 In a subsequent 
trial, which was limited to patients self-identified 
as African American, the addition of a fixed-dose 
combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dini-
trate to standard therapy with an ACEi or ARB, a 
beta blocker, and MRA offered significant benefit.2 
Thus, the combination of hydralazine and isosor-
bide dinitrate is appropriate for African Americans 
with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite con-
comitant use of ACEi (or ARB), beta blockers, and 
MRA. There are insufficient data for concomitant 
use with ARNi.
2. The economic value of hydralazine and isosorbide 
nitrate therapy was assessed by the A-HeFT trial.3 
This analysis found hydralazine and isosorbide 
dinitrate increased survival and reduced health 
care costs over the 12.8-month trial. Extrapolating 
beyond the trial, the analysis found hydralazine and 
isosorbide dinitrate remained high value over a life-
time with a cost per life-year <$60 000 despite 
conservative assumptions regarding the durabil-
ity of therapy effectiveness and previously higher 
hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate costs.
3. It is unclear if a benefit of hydralazine-isosorbide 
dinitrate (suggested in a trial before the use of 
ACEi)4 exists for non–African Americans with 
HFrEF. Despite the lack of data with the vaso-
dilator combination in patients who are intoler-
ant of ACEi or ARB, especially those with renal 
insufficiency, the combined use of hydralazine 
and isosorbide dinitrate might be considered as 
a therapeutic option in such patients. Although 
the potential benefit is unknown and has not 
been shown in recent observational datasets,5 in 
V-HeFT I, the use of hydralazine and isosorbide 
dinitrate reduced mortality in patients with HF 
treated with digoxin and diuretics, compared with 
placebo.4 If patients are unable to tolerate first-
line agents, such as ARNi, ACEi, or ARB, because 
of drug intolerance, hypotension, or renal insuf-
ficiency, referral to a HF specialist can provide 
guidance for further management, and the use 
of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in these 
patients might be considered.7.3.6. Other Drug Treatment

reported studies, omega-3 PUFA therapy has been 
well tolerated. Recent studies have reported that 
in patients with cardiovascular risk treated with 
omega-3 fatty acid, there may be a dose-related 
risk of AF.3,15,16
2. Hyperkalemia is common in HF as a result of 
the syndrome itself, comorbidities (diabetes, 
CKD), and use of RAASi, and can increase the 
risk for ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.11 
Hyperkalemia results in dose reductions or dis-
continuation of RAASi, compromising their cardio-
renal benefit in HF.12 Two newer gastrointestinal 
potassium binders—patiromer (RL Y5016) and 
sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC)—remove 
potassium by exchanging cations (calcium for pat-
iromer, and sodium and hydrogen for SZC), lead-
ing to increased fecal excretion. Both agents have 
been FDA approved for treatment of hyperkalemia 
for patients receiving RAASi. In the PEARL-HF 
(Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of RL Y5016, 
a polymeric potassium binder in patients with 
chronic heart failure) trial, patiromer led to lower 
potassium levels, less hyperkalemia, and a higher 
proportion of patients able to increase spironolac-
tone dose to 50 mg daily compared with placebo.5 
The HARMONIZE (Hyperkalemia Randomized 
Intervention Multidose ZS-9 Maintenance) trial 
included 94 patients (out of 258 total) with HF 
(87 of whom entered the double-blind phase).6,13 
The SZC groups achieved lower potassium lev-
els overall compared with placebo, and a higher 
proportion maintained normokalemia (potassium 
levels, <5.1 mEq/L). Whether patiromer or SZC 
improve clinical outcomes is under investigation. 
Adverse effects for the newer potassium bind-
ers include hypomagnesemia (for patiromer) and 
edema (for SZC).
3. In several retrospective analyses, the risk of throm-
boembolic events was not lower in patients with 
HF taking warfarin than in patients not treated with 
antithrombotic drugs.17–19 The use of warfarin was 
associated with a reduction in major cardiovascular 
events and death in patients with HF in some stud-
ies but not in others.20–22 An RCT that compared 
the outcome of patients with HFrEF assigned 
to aspirin, warfarin, or clopidogrel found that no 
therapy was superior.7 Another trial that compared 
aspirin with warfarin in patients with reduced L VEF, 
sinus rhythm, and no cardioembolic source showed 
no difference in either the primary outcome of 
death, stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, and no difference in the combined outcome of death, isch-
emic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, MI, or HF 
hospitalization.8 There was a significant increase 
in major bleeding with warfarin. A trial of rivaroxa-
ban in patients with HFrEF, CAD, and normal sinus 
rhythm showed no difference in mortality, MI, and 
stroke compared with placebo.9 Therefore, there is 
no evidence of benefit for anticoagulation in HF 
patients without a specific indication (eg, VTE, AF, 
a previous thromboembolic event, or a cardioem-
bolic source).

not exhaustive but focus on the most relevant and com-
monly encountered medications in the management of 
patients with HFrEF: calcium channel blockers; antiar-

type 2 diabetes including thiazolidinediones and DPP-4 
inhibitors; and vitamins, hormones, and nutritional sup-
plements.

1. Second-generation dihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers, including amlodipine and 
felodipine, have greater selectivity for calcium 
channels in vascular smooth muscle cells and 
less myocardial depressant activity. By reduc-
ing peripheral vasoconstriction and L V afterload, 
calcium channel blockers were thought to have 
a potential role in the management of chronic 
HF. The PRAISE-1 (Prospective Randomized 
Amlodipine Survival Evaluation-1) study showed 
a reduction in mortality in the subgroup of 
patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who 
received amlodipine.1 However, in the PRAISE-2 
(Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival

with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, no survival 
benefit was observed, indicating the limitations 
of conclusions derived from subgroup analyses.29 
However, dihydropyridine calcium channel block-

unresolved. There is a lack of evidence of benefit 
from vitamin D,3–5 thiamine,34–36 carnitine,37 and 
taurine38,39 and potential harm from vitamin E.6,7 
The largest RCT of coenzyme Q10—Q-SYMBIO 
(Coenzyme Q10 as adjunctive treatment of chronic 
heart failure with focus on SYMptoms, BIomarker 
status [Brain-Natriuretic Peptide], and long-term 
Outcome [hospitalisations/mortality])—showed no 
changes in NYHA functional classification at 16 
weeks, although the incidence of major adverse 
cardiovascular events at 2 years was significantly 
reduced (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.80; 
P=0.003).8 Despite these findings, concerns about 
slow recruitment in this trial have tempered enthusi-
asm for coenzyme Q10 supplementation in clinical 
practice.9,31 Hormonal therapies have been proposed 
for the treatment of HF, but trials have shown a neu-
tral effect of testosterone,40,41 growth hormone,30,42 
and thyroid hormone43–45 in HF outcomes.

associated with a higher risk of recurrent HF.11,12
4. In the CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression) 
trial, patients with asymptomatic ventricular 
arrhythmias post-MI on the class IC antiarrhyth-
mics encainide or flecainide had increased mortal-
ity.14 The applicability of CAST to patients without 
recent MI or to other class I antiarrhythmic drugs 
is uncertain, but class IC antiarrhythmic agents 
are generally avoided in patients with structural 
heart disease. In ANDROMEDA (Antiarrhythmic 
Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate to Severe 
CHF Evaluating Morbidity Decrease Study), for 
the class III antiarrhythmic dronedarone, patients 
with HFrEF who were hospitalized had increased 
mortality.16 In the SWORD (Survival With ORal 
D-sotalol) trial of the class III antiarrhythmic sotalol, 
patients with HF post-MI had increased mortality.15 
However, SWORD was published in 1996, and 
whether sotalol would be harmful in the current 
era of GDMT and ICDs is uncertain; sotalol may 
be used for refractory atrial-ventricular arrhyth-
mias with close monitoring for decompensation. 
Amiodarone46,47 and dofetilide48,49 are the only anti-
arrhythmic agents with neutral effects on mortal-
ity in clinical trials of patients with HFrEF. Class IA 
antiarrhythmic agents such as quinidine and class 
IB agents such as mexiletine have not been stud-
ied and may be indicated for the management of 
refractory ventricular arrhythmias in the context of 
the individual patient’s risk benefit calculus and in 
conjunction with electrophysiology consultation.
5. Thiazolidinediones increase insulin sensitivity by 
activating nuclear peroxisome proliferator-acti-
vated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). Expressed in 
virtually all tissues, PPAR-γ also regulates sodium 
reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney. 
In observational cohort studies,17 meta-analysis,18 
and clinical trials,19–21 thiazolidinediones have been 
associated with increased incidence of fluid reten-
tion and HF events in those patients with19,21or 
without18,20a previous history of HF.
6. DPP-4 is a cell-surface enzyme that deactivates 
several peptides include glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like 
peptide 1. DPP-4 inhibitors affect glucose reg-
ulation through multiple mechanisms, includ-
ing enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin 
secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and reduction 
of postprandial glucagon and of food intake. The 
impact of DPP-4 inhibitors on cardiovascular out-
comes in patients with diabetes and high cardio-
vascular risk has been assessed in multiple RCTs. 
Saxagliptin increased the risk of hospitalization 
for HF,22 as did alogliptin in a post hoc analysis including only patients with no HF history,23,50 but 
sitagliptin51,52and linagliptin53–55 did not; these 
findings may have been a result of baseline dif-
ferences in the use of metformin, thiazolidinedio-
nes, and insulin, which also affect HF risk. The 
FDA recommends discontinuation specifically of 
saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop 
H F,56 and whether the risk of worsening HF is a 
class effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is unclear.
7 . NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of renal prosta-
glandins, which mediate vasodilation in the kid-
neys and directly inhibit sodium resorption in the 
thick ascending loop of Henle and collecting 
tubule. Hence, NSAIDs can cause sodium and 
water retention and blunt the effects of diuret-
ics. Several observational cohort studies have 
revealed increased morbidity and mortality in 
patients with HF using either nonselective or 
selective NSAIDs.25–28

Referenced studies that support the recommendations are

COR LOE Recommendations
1 A1. In patients with HFrEF, titration of guideline-
directed medication dosing to achieve target 
doses showed to be efficacious in RCTs is rec-
ommended, to reduce cardiovascular mortality 
and HF hospitalizations, unless not well toler-
ated.1–10
2a C-EO2. In patients with HFrEF, titration and optimiza-
tion of guideline-directed medications as 
frequently as every 1 to 2 weeks depending on 
the patient’s symptoms, vital signs, and labora-
tory findings can be useful to optimize manage-
ment.
Synopsis
Clinical trials of ACEi, ARB, ARNi, beta blockers, and 
most other HFrEF medications had therapy initiated at 
low dose by trial protocol.1–9,11–14 If the initial dose was 
tolerated, the protocol would then direct the uptitration 
of medication dose over time to a specified target dose 
(Table 14), unless not well tolerated. Even if symptoms 
improved or other indicators of response were shown 
at lower doses, the medication dose would still be in-
creased to the trial-defined target doses. Because 
these target doses were the ones that established the 
efficacy and safety of these medications in HFrEF and 
serve as the basis of the guideline recommendations 
(Table 15), use of these target doses is recommended, 
if tolerated.1–9,11–14 Use of all 4 drug classes has been 
estimated to reduce all-cause mortality by 73% com-
pared with no treatment.15
If the target dose cannot be achieved or is not well tol-
erated, then the highest tolerated dose is recommended.

1. The use of these specific medications for HFrEF 
should involve initiation at low-starting doses, 
uptitration at specified intervals as tolerated, and 
achieving-maintaining the target doses shown to 
be effective in major clinical trials. Every effort 
should be made by clinicians to achieve and main-
tain the clinical trial–defined target doses (Table 
13) of guideline-directed medications, as long as 
they are well tolerated by the patient. Patients 
should be monitored for changes in heart rate, 
blood pressure, electrolytes, renal function, and 
symptoms during this uptitration period. Planned 
uptitration of a HF medication should be delayed 
until any adverse effects observed with lower 
doses have resolved. When such a strategy is 
used for dose titration, most patients (approxi-
mately 70%–85%) enrolled in clinical trials who 
received these medications were able to tolerate 
short-, intermediate-, and long-term treatment 
with these agents and achieve and maintain 
the trial defined target dose.1–9,11–14 Repeated 
attempts at uptitration can result in optimization, 
even if initial attempts may fail. In patients with 
HFrEF, beta blockers provide dose-dependent 
improvements in L VEF, reduction in HF hospi-
talizations, and reduction in all-cause mortality.17 
Trials of lower versus higher dose of ACEi and 
ARB have shown lower risk of cardiovascular 
death or HF hospitalization with higher doses, 
with similar safety and tolerability.17 ,18
2. Initiation and titration should be individualized and 
optimized without delay according to patient’s 
symptoms, vital signs, functional status, tolerance, 
renal function, electrolytes, comorbidities, specific cause of HF, and ability of follow-up. In patients 
with HFrEF, simultaneous initiation or sequencing, 
and order of guideline-directed medications are 
usually individualized according to patient’s symp-
toms, vital signs, functional status, tolerance, renal 
function, electrolytes, comorbidities, specific cause 
of HF, and ability of follow-up, and does not neces-
sarily need to be done according to the sequence 
of trial publications and should not be delayed.

COR LOE Recommendation
2a B-R1. For patients with symptomatic (NYHA class II 
to III) stable chronic HFrEF (LVEF ≤35%) who 
are receiving GDMT, including a beta blocker 
at maximum tolerated dose, and who are in 
sinus rhythm with a heart rate of ≥70 bpm at 
rest, ivabradine can be beneficial to reduce HF 
hospitalizations and cardiovascular death.1,2
Synopsis
Heart rate is a strong predictor of cardiovascular out-
comes in the general population and in patients with 
CVD, including HF. The SHIFT (Ivabradine and Outcomes 
in Chronic Heart Failure) trial tested the hypothesis that 
reducing heart rate in patients with HF improves cardio-
vascular outcomes.1 SHIFT demonstrated the efficacy of 
ivabradine, a sinoatrial node modulator that selectively 
inhibits the If current, in reducing the composite endpoint 
of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in patients 
with HF. See Figure 7 for a summary of additional medi-
cal therapy recommendations.Table 15. Benefits of Evidence-Based Therapies for Patients With HFrEF3–6,8,10–14,23,31–42

1. Although the primary outcome in SHIFT was a com-
posite of hospitalization and cardiovascular death, 
the greatest benefit was a reduction in HF hospi-
talization. SHIFT included patients with HFrEF and 
L VEF ≤35% who were in sinus rhythm with a resting 
heart rate of ≥70 bpm. Participants were predomi-
nantly NYHA class II and III. Participants had been 
hospitalized for HF in the preceding 12 months and 
were on stable GDMT for 4 weeks before initiation 
of ivabradine therapy.1–4 The target of ivabradine 
is heart rate, and the benefit of ivabradine results 
from a reduction in heart rate. However, only 25% 
of patients studied in SHIFT were on optimal doses 
of beta-blocker therapy. Given the well-proven mor-
tality benefits of beta-blocker therapy, these agents 
should be initiated and uptitrated to target doses, 
as tolerated, before assessing the resting heart rate 
for consideration of ivabradine initiation.5,67.3.9.2. Pharmacological Treatment for Stage C

Recommendation for the Pharmacological Treatment for Stage C 
HFrEF: Digoxin
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized

COR LOE Recommendation
2b B-R1. In patients with symptomatic HFrEF despite 
GDMT (or who are unable to tolerate GDMT), 
digoxin might be considered to decrease hospi-
talizations for HF.1,2
Synopsis
To date, there has been only 1 large-scale, RCT of digox-
in in patients with HF.1 This trial, which predated current 
GDMT, primarily enrolled patients with NYHA class II to 
III HF and showed that treatment with digoxin for 2 to 5 
years had no effect on mortality but modestly reduced 
the combined risk of death and hospitalization. The trial 
also found no significant effect on health-related QOL 
in a subset of the trial patients.3 The effect of digoxin 
on hospitalizations has been supported by retrospective 
analyses and meta-analyses.2,4–6 Additionally, observa-
tional studies and retrospective analyses have shown 
improvement in symptoms and exercise tolerance in mild 
to moderate HF; however, they have mostly shown either 
lack of mortality benefit or increased mortality associated 
with digoxin.7 The benefit in patients on current GDMT 
is unclear because most trials preceded current GDMT. 
Thus, use of digoxin requires caution in patients with HF 
and is reserved for those who remain symptomatic de-
spite optimization of GDMT.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Digoxin is usually initiated at a low dose because 
higher doses are rarely required in the management 
of HF and are potentially detrimental. Two retro-
spective analyses of large-scale clinical trials have 
shown a linear relationship between mortality and 
digoxin serum concentration in patients with AF 
and at risk for stroke, including those with HF, and 
in patients with HF. The risk of death was indepen-
dently associated with serum digoxin concentration, 
with a significantly higher risk observed in those with 
concentrations ≥1.2 ng/mL and ≥1.6 ng/mL.8,9 The 
benefit of digoxin in patients with HF remains con-
troversial. GDMT is expected to be optimized before 
considering the addition of digoxin. Clinical worsen-
ing after withdrawal of digoxin has been shown.10 
Therapy with digoxin may either be continued in the 
absence of a contraindication or discontinued with 
caution.11 Therapy with digoxin is commonly initi-
ated and maintained at a dose of 0.125 to 0.25 mg 
daily. Low doses (0.125 mg daily or every other day) 
should be used initially if the patient is >70 years of

COR LOE Recommendation
2b B-R1. In selected high-risk patients with HFrEF and 
recent worsening of HF already on GDMT, 
an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator 
(vericiguat) may be considered to reduce HF 
hospitalization and cardiovascular death.1
Synopsis
In patients with progression of HFrEF despite GDMT, 
there may be a role for novel therapeutic agents. Oral 
soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulator (eg, vericiguat) di-
rectly binds and stimulates sGC and increases cGMP 
production. cGMP has several potentially beneficial 
effects in patients with HF, including vasodilation, im-
provement in endothelial function, as well as decrease 
in fibrosis and remodeling of the heart.2–7 The VICTORIA 
(Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects with Heart Failure 
with Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial randomized 5050 
higher-risk patients with worsening HFrEF to vericiguat 
versus placebo.1
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Patients with HFrEF in the VICTORIA trial had L VEF 
<45%, NYHA class II to IV, were on GDMT, with 
elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP ≥300 pg/mL 
or NT-proBNP ≥1000 pg/mL if in sinus rhythm; 
higher cutoffs with AF), and recent HF worsening 
(hospitalized within 6 months or recently received 
intravenous diuretic therapy without hospitaliza-
tion). Patients on long-acting nitrates, with SBP 
<100 mm Hg, or eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 
excluded.1 Over a median follow-up of 10.8 months, 
the primary outcome, cardiovascular death or HF 
hospitalization, occurred in 35.5% with vericiguat 
compared with 38.5% with placebo (HR, 0.90; 
P=0.019). All-cause mortality occurred in 20.3% 
in the vericiguat group and 21.2% in the placebo 
group (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84-1.07; P=0.38) and 
composite of any-cause death or HF hospitaliza-
tion was also lower in the vericiguat group versus 
placebo group (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83–0.98; 
P=0.02). The relative risk reduction of 10% in the 
primary outcome was lower than expected, even in a higher risk population. Although not statistically 
significant, symptomatic hypotension (9.1% versus 
7 .9%; P=0.12) and syncope (4.0% versus 3.5%; 
P=0.30) were numerically higher in the vericiguat 
group versus placebo. There was heterogeneity 
by subgroup analysis, and patients in the highest 
quartile of NT-proBNP subgroup (NT proBNP level 
>5314 pg/mL) did not have benefit from vericiguat 
when compared with placebo.

Synopsis
RCTs have informed the decisions regarding cardiac 
implantable devices (ICDs and CRTs) over the past 20 
years. In fact, the seminal RCTs for ICDs and CRTs are 
unlikely to be repeated. Subgroup analyses of these tri-
als have also informed decisions, but these were not the 
primary endpoints of these studies and thus should be 
interpreted with caution. GDMT is optimized before ICD 
and CRT implantation to assess whether the L VEF im-
proves. Figures 8 and 9 summarize device and interven-
tional therapy recommendations.Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. ICDs were first assessed in patients who had 
been resuscitated from a cardiac arrest. In AVID 
(Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators 
trial), CASH (Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg), 
and CIDS (Canadian Implantable Defibrillator 
StudyS), benefit was observed in those who were 
randomized to ICDs.1–3 Extension of benefit was 
then shown in other patient populations that 
were at perceived risk of SCD. In the first MADIT 
(Multicenter Automated Defibrillator Implantation 
Trial) trial, patients with previous MI, L VEF ≤35% 
with nonsustained VT had a mortality benefit with 
ICD.4 Similar populations in MUSTT (Multicenter 
UnSustained Tachycardia Trial) also showed bene-
fit.5 In MADIT-II (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator 
Implantation Trial II), patients with no arrhyth-
mia qualifier but with previous MIs and L VEF 
≤30% derived benefit from ICD.6 The DEFINITE 
(Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy 
Treatment Evaluation) study included only non-
ischemic patients with L VEF ≤35% and frequent 
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or non-
sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).7 There was 
a trend to mortality benefit, but it ultimately did 
not achieve significance. In SCD-HEFT (Sudden 
Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial), patients with 
ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, L VEF 
≤35%, and HF class II to III showed benefit with 
an ICD compared with either amiodarone or pla-
cebo.8 More recently, the DANISH (Defibrillator 
Implantation in Patients with Nonischemic Systolic 
Heart Failure) trial enrolled patients with nonisch-
emic cardiomyopathy and L VEF ≤35% to ICD or 
standard care.9 There was no reduction in the pri-
mary endpoint of total mortality, but there was a 
reduction in SCD risk. In the DANISH trial, 58% of 
patients in each limb received CRT, possibly miti-
gating the benefit of an ICD.
2. Economic outcomes of ICD implantation for pri-
mary prevention of SCD were assessed in 3 RCTs 
(MADIT-I,13 MADIT-II,15 and SCD-HeFT,12 1 obser-
vational study,10 and 3 simulation models,11,14,42 all 
of which had generally consistent results. All stud-
ies reported increased survival and life expectancy 
and higher lifetime costs of medical care with an 
ICD than without an ICD. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios were generally <$60 000 per 
year of life added by an ICD, which provides high 
value according to the benchmarks adopted for the 
current guideline. The value provided by an ICD 
was consistently high when life expectancy was 
projected to increase by >1.4 years.14 In contrast, 
when survival was not increased by ICD implanta-
tion, as in the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 
Patch trial,43 the ICD did not provide value, because Recommendations for ICDs and CRTs (Continued)

life expectancy.14
3. The MADIT-II trial randomized patients with previ-
ous MI and L VEF <30%, without any limitation of 
HF class, to ICDs or not.6 Thirty-seven percent of 
the patients were in class I congestive heart failure 
(CHF). Mortality was reduced with an ICD.
4. Most of the relevant data for the guidelines of 
CRT in HF come from seminal trials published 
from 2002 to 2010. The first of these was the 
MIRACLE (Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical 
Evaluation) trial, which took patients with L VEF 
≤35%, moderate to severe HF, and QRS duration 
≥130 ms.16 There was a benefit in the 6-minute 
walk test, QOL, functional HF classification, and 
L VEF. The COMPANION (Comparison of Medical 
Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure) 
trial, which enrolled NYHA class III to IV patients 
with QRS ≥120 ms, included 3 arms: GDMT, CRT-D, 
and CRT pacemaker (CRT-P).17 The primary end-
point of death or hospitalization was decreased with CRT-P and CRT-D. The CARE-HF (Cardiac 
Resynchronization Heart Failure) trial included 
a similar group with NYHA class III to IV, L VEF 
≤35%, QRS >120 ms, and showed a significant 
reduction in primary and endpoint of death or hos-
pitalization.18 In the REVERSE (Resynchronization 
Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular 
Dysfunction) trial, patients with NYHA class I to II 
and L VEF ≤40% were randomized to CRT-D on for 
1 year and CRT-D off for 1 year or vice versa.19 A 
HF composite endpoint was less common when 
CRT was activated. MADIT-CRT enrolled NYHA 
class I and II HF with L VEF ≤30% and QRS ≥130 
ms and compared CRT-D with ICD.20 The primary 
endpoint of death or HF was reduced by CRT-D. 
The RAFT (Resynchronization-Defibrillation for 
Ambulatory Heart Failure) trial randomized patients 
with NYHA class II to III HF, L VEF ≤30%, QRS 
>120 ms, or paced QRS ≥200 ms and compared 
CRT-D with ICD.21 Again, there was a reduction in 
the primary endpoint of death or HF hospitalization.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline5. The economic value of CRT has been evaluated 
by 3 RCTs (COMPANION,22 MADIT-CRT,26 and 
REVERSE23), 2 model-based analyses,25,27 and 1 
observational study.24 These analyses consistently 
found CRT increased survival and QOL in addition 
to increasing health care costs. However, the eco-
nomic value of CRT likely varies as a result of the 
shown variation in treatment effect.26 Among popu-
lations with larger expected mortality reduction and 
improvement in QOL, such as patients with a LBBB 
with QRS duration >150 ms, the cost per QAL Y is 
<$60 000.22,26,27 Among other populations expected 
to have smaller treatment benefit, the economic 
value is more uncertain. However, a model-based 
analysis of patients with NYHA class I to II found 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained 
<$150 000 per QAL Y with even small reductions in 
all-cause mortality.27 Therefore, CRT likely provides 
at least intermediate value for patients with other 
guideline-indicated recommendations in which CRT 
is expected to reduce mortality.
6. Subgroup analysis of the previously mentioned tri-
als has informed us of the predictors of benefit, including longer QRS duration, and LBBB versus 
non-LBBB.28 The most benefit was gained with 
wider QRS durations and with LBBB. This was 
true in COMPANION, CARE-HF, MADIT-CRT, 
REVERSE, and RAFT.17 ,29–32 A QRS duration >150 
ms was also a predictor of response, and in those 
with non-LBBB, a prolonged PR predicted benefit 
in MADIT-CRT but not in REVERSE.33
7 . Extension of benefit to those with L VEF between 
35% and 50% has been seen. In the BLOCK-HF 
(Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in 
Heart Failure) trial, patients with NYHA class I 
to III HF, L VEF ≤50%, and atrioventricular block 
randomized to RV pacing or CRT, there was ben-
efit to CRT in reduction in the primary outcome of 
death, urgent HF visit, or 15% increase in L V end 
systolic volume.34
8. In the previously mentioned CRT trials, there was 
some benefit for those with LBBB and QRS dura-
tions between 120 and 149, but not as much ben-
efit as those with LBBB ≥150 ms.17 ,28–32
9. Several trials have included patients with AF. 
In the MUSTIC AF (Multisite Stimulation in 
Cardiomyopathies),44 RAFT,45 and the SPARE 
(Spanish Atrial Fibrillation and Resynchronization)46 
trials, there were benefits in patients with AF, 
while in COMPANION,47 AF attenuated the ben-
efit of CRT. In the PAVE (Post AV Nodal Ablation 
Evaluation) study, patients with NYHA class II to III, 
mean L VEF of 46%, and AF undergoing atrioven-
tricular node ablation, CRT improved the 6-minute 
walk test and L VEF compared with those who were 
RV paced.35
10. In patients in whom there is an expected high bur-
den of ventricular pacing, especially if >40%, CRT 
may be used to reduce mortality, reduce hospital-
izations, and improve symptoms and QOL.35,48
11. Identification of specific arrhythmogenic genetic 
variants such as LMNA/C, desmosomal proteins, 
phospholamban, and Filamin-C carry implications 
for implantation of ICDs for primary prevention 
of sudden death even in patients who have L VEF 
>35%, or <3 months of GDMT. Most patients with 
LMNA/C cardiomyopathy will progress to cardiac 
transplantation, sometimes precipitated by refrac-
tory arrhythmias more than by pump failure.36–38,49
12. Subgroup analysis of the CRT RCTs has shown 
that patients with L VEFs ≤35%, non-LBBB, and 
QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms and NYHA class 
III to ambulatory class IV did not derive as much 
benefit as those with LBBB ≥120 ms.17 ,28–32
13. The MADIT-CRT trial included NYHA class I (and 
class II) patients with ischemic heart disease, L VEF 
≤30%, and QRS >130 ms.39 Patients with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy were enrolled if they had 
NYHA class II HF.

has been attempted but has generally failed. In the 
RETHINQ (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in 
Patients with Heart Failure and Narrow QRS) trial, 
patients with QRS duration <130 ms were ran-
domized to CRT or not.40 There was no benefit from 
CRT, but subgroup analysis showed there was a 
benefit with QRS durations between 120 and 130 
ms. In the ECHO-CRT (Echocardiography Guided 
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) trial, patients 
with NYHA class III to IV HF, L VEF ≤35% and a 
QRS duration ≤130 ms, and mechanical dysyn-
chrony on echocardiography underwent random-
ization to CRT.50 There was no benefit to CRT in 
this trial. And in the LESSER-EARTH (Evaluation 
of Resynchronization Therapy for Heart Failure) 
trial, patients with severe L V dysfunction and QRS 
<120 ms derived no benefit from CRT.51 The 
NARROW-CRT (Narrow QRS Ischemic Patients 
Treated With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) 
was the only trial that showed a benefit in a clinical 
composite score in patients with an indication for 
an ICD and QRS <120 ms.52

benefit for those with L VEF ≤35%, non-LBBB 120

7.4.2. Other Implantable Electrical Interventions
Autonomic nervous system modulation is intriguing as a 
treatment for HFrEF because of the heightened sym-
pathetic response and decreased parasympathetic re-
sponse in HF.1 Trials of device stimulation of the vagus 
nerve, spinal cord, and baroreceptors have had mixed 
responses.2 An implantable device that electrically stimu-
lates the baroreceptors of the carotid artery has been 
approved by the FDA for the improvement of symptoms 
in patients with advanced HF who are unsuited for treat-
ment with other HF devices including CRT. In a prospec-
tive, multicenter, RCT with a total of 408 patients with 
current or recent NYHA class III HF, L VEF ≤35%, baro-
receptor stimulation was associated with improvements 
in QOL, exercise capacity, and NT-proBNP levels.3 To 
date, there are no mortality or hospitalization rates results 
available with this device. Although early trials of vagus 
nerve stimulation were positive, the largest and latest trial 
did not show a reduction in mortality and HF hospital-
izations.4 Multisite L V pacing studies initially were prom-
ising.5,6 However, more recent data have not confirmed 
benefit, and the larger phase 2 trial was terminated early 
for low probability of benefit.7 His bundle and left bundle 
pacing are attractive because they use the intrinsic con-
duction system. In observational data, there does appear 
to be a benefit over RV pacing8; however, comparisons 
to CRT are limited.9,10 Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM), a device-based therapy that involves applying 
relatively high-voltage, long-duration electric signals to 
the RV septal wall during the absolute myocardial refrac-
tory period, has been associated with augmentation of 
L V contractile performance. CCM is FDA-approved for 
patients with NYHA class III with L VEF of 25% to 45% 
who are not candidates for CRT. Four RCTs have shown 
benefits in exercise capacity and QOL but, as of yet, no 
benefits in death or hospitalizations.11–14 Most patients in 
these trials were class III CHF.3

1 B-R1. In selected patients with HF, reduced EF (EF 
≤35%), and suitable coronary anatomy, surgical 
revascularization plus GDMT is beneficial to 
improve symptoms, cardiovascular hospitaliza-
tions, and long-term all-cause mortality.1–8
Synopsis
CAD is commonly associated with HF, necessitating re-
vascularization in selected patients with angina or HF 
symptoms. Data from the STICH Trial showed that, com-
pared with optimal medical management alone, CABG 
surgery plus GDMT did not reduce the primary endpoint 
of all-cause mortality at a median of 56 months; how-
ever, at 10 years’ follow-up, CABG+GDMT resulted in 
significant reductions in all-cause mortality, cardiovas-
cular mortality, and death from any cause or cardiovas-
cular hospitalization in patients with L VEF ≤35% and 
ischemic cardiomyopathy.7, 8 Furthermore, a retrospective 
analysis showed significant reductions in first and recur-
rent all-cause, cardiovascular, and HF hospitalizations at 
10 years in patients receiving CABG+ optimal medical 
therapy compared with optimal medical therapy alone.2 
Similar benefits from percutaneous coronary intervention 
revascularization, in this cohort, have not yet been shown 
in an RCT, although the REVIVED-BCIS2 (Study of Ef-
ficacy and Safety of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
to Improve Survival in Heart Failure) trial, which com-
pares percutaneous coronary intervention with medical 
therapy in a similar population, is ongoing.9 Recent data 
continue to show a benefit of CABG over percutaneous 
coronary intervention in patients with diabetes, CAD, and 
L V dysfunction and in patients with left main CAD and 
moderate or severe L V dysfunction.4,6,10 Figure 9 sum-

Recommendations for Valvular Heart Disease
Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summa-

COR LOE Recommendations
1 B-R1. In patients with HF, VHD should be managed in a 
multidisciplinary manner in accordance with clini-
cal practice guidelines for VHD to prevent wors-
ening of HF and adverse clinical outcomes.1–11
1 C-LD2. In patients with chronic severe secondary MR 
and HFrEF, optimization of GDMT is recom-
mended before any intervention for secondary 
MR related to LV dysfunction.3–5,12–14
Synopsis
GDMT applies to all patients with HFrEF, irrespective of 
the presence of VHD. Significant valve disease warrants 
evaluation by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in 
VHD, and management should proceed in accordance 
with the VHD guidelines.15
Mitral Regurgitation
Optimization of GDMT can improve secondary MR as-
sociated with L V dysfunction and obviate the need for 
intervention.14,16,17 Therefore, optimizing GDMT and re-
assessing MR before MV interventions are important. 
Patients with persistent severe secondary MR despite 
GDMT may benefit from either surgical or transcatheter 
repair, depending on clinical scenario. Thus, patient-
centric conversation with a multidisciplinary cardiovas-
cular team that includes a cardiologist with expertise 
in HF is essential when considering MV intervention.15 
Two RCTs of transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge 
repair (TEER) in patients with HFrEF and severe sec-
ondary MR have been performed. The COAPT trial 
showed significant reduction in HF and all-cause mor-tality in patients treated with TEER and GDMT com-
pared with GDMT alone, while MITRA-FR (Multicentre 
Study of Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair MitraClip 
Device in Patients With Severe Secondary Mitral Re-
gurgitation) showed no benefit of TEER over GDMT in 
reducing death or hospitalization.6 Specifically, trans-
catheter edge-to-edge MV repair has been shown to be 
beneficial in patients with persistent symptoms despite 
GDMT, appropriate anatomy on transesophageal echo-
cardiography and with L VEF between 20% and 50%, 
L VESD ≤70 mm, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
≤70 mm Hg6 (Figure 10). Optimal management of sec-
ondary MR may depend on the degree of MR relative 
to L V remodeling.4,5,14,18–22 Disproportionate MR (MR out 
of proportion to L V remodeling) may respond better to 
procedural interventions that reduce MR, such as CRT, 
TEER, and MV surgery. Proportionate MR may respond 
to measures that reverse L V remodeling and reduce L V 
volumes, such as GDMT and CRT.
Aortic Stenosis
In patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, transcath-
eter and surgical aortic valve repair can improve survival, 
symptoms, and L V function.15 However, the choice of 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical 
aortic valve replacement is based on shared decision-
making, indications, and assessment of the risk-benefit 
profile.23,24 The benefit of GDMT in nonsevere aortic ste-
nosis and HFrEF is being evaluated in the TAVR UNLOAD 
(Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the 
Left Ventricle in Patients With Advanced Heart Failure) 
trial.25 GDMT is usually continued in conjunction with 
clinical surveillance and imaging in patients with nonse-
vere aortic stenosis and reduced EF.
Tricuspid Regurgitation
The severity of secondary tricuspid regurgitation may 
be dynamic, depending on RV function and pulmonary 
hypertension, and management entails focusing on 
underlying causes, such as pulmonary hypertension, 
RV failure, and HFrEF. Referral to the multidisciplinary 
team for consideration of intervention might be helpful in 
patients with refractory tricuspid regurgitation.

2. GDMT, including RAAS inhibition, beta blockers, 
and biventricular pacing, improves MR and L V 
dimensions in patients with HFrEF and second-
ary MR, particularly MR that is proportionate to L V 
dilatation.1–5,12,13,17 In a small RCT, sacubitril-valsar-
tan resulted in a significant reduction in effective 
regurgitant area and in regurgitant volume when 
compared with valsartan. The COAPT trial showed 
a mortality benefit with TEER in patients with severe secondary MR, L VEF between 20% and 
50%, L V end-systolic diameter ≤ 70 mm, PA systolic 
pressure ≤70 mm Hg, and persistent symptoms 
(NYHA class II to IV) while on optimal GDMT,28 
and these criteria apply when considering TEER. 
A cardiologist with expertise in the management 
of HF is integral to shared decision-making for 
valve intervention and should guide optimization of 
GDMT to ensure that medical options for HF and 
secondary MR have been effectively applied for 
an appropriate time period and exhausted before 
considering intervention.

Synopsis
There are no prospective RCTs for patients specifically 
with HFmrEF (L VEF, 41%–49%). All data for HFmrEF 
are from post hoc or subsets of analyses from previous 
HF trials with patients now classified as HFmrEF. L VEF is 
a spectrum, and among patients with L VEF 41% to 49%, 
patients with L VEF on the lower end of this spectrum ap-pear to respond to medical therapies similarly to patients 
with HFrEF. Thus, it may be reasonable to treat these pa-
tients with GDMT used for treatment of HFrEF. Patients 
with HFmrEF should have repeat evaluation of L VEF to 
determine the trajectory of their disease process. Future 
prospective studies are needed to further clarify treat-
ment recommendations for patients with HFmrEF. Figure 
11 summarizes COR 1, 2a, and 2b for HFmrEF.

1. EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial 
in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved 
Ejection Fraction) showed a significant benefit of 
the SGL T2i, empagliflozin, in patients with symptom-
atic HF, with L VEF >40% and elevated natriuretic 
peptides.1 The 21% reduction in the primary com-
posite endpoint of time to HF hospitalization or car-
diovascular death was driven mostly by a significant 
29% reduction in time to HF hospitalization (nonsig-
nificant lower cardiovascular death [HR, 0.91; 95% 
CI, 0.76–1.0]), with no benefit on all-cause mortality. 
Empagliflozin also resulted in a significant reduction 
in total HF hospitalizations, decrease in the slope 
of the eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in 
QOL at 52 weeks. Of note, the benefit was simi-
lar irrespective of the presence or absence of dia-
betes at baseline. In a subgroup of 1983 patients 
with L VEF 41% to 49% in EMPEROR-Preserved, 
empagliflozin, a SGL T2i, reduced the risk of the pri-
mary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or 
hospitalization for HF.1 Although the benefit in the 
primary endpoint did not have a significant interac-
tion by L VEF subgroups (41%–49%, 50%–<60%, 
and >60%),1 in a subgroup analysis by EF, there 
was a signal for lower benefit on the primary com-
posite endpoint, first and recurrent hospitalizations 
for HF at higher L VEFs >62.5%.10
2. Post hoc and subsets of analyses of HFrEF trials 
that included HFmrEF (L VEF 41%–49%) have 
suggested benefit from use of GDMT for HFrEF (ie, 
beta blockers, ARNi, ACEi or ARB, and spironolac-
tone).2,3,5–8 The BBmeta-HF (Beta-blockers in Heart 
Failure Collaborative Group) performed a meta-anal-
ysis of 11 HF trials; in a subgroup of 575 patients 
with L VEF 40% to 49% in sinus rhythm, beta 
blockers reduced the primary outcome of all-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality.2 A subgroup analysis 
of the PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison 
of ARNi with ARB Global Outcomes in HF with 
Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial for patients with 
L VEF 45% to 57% (lower range of EFs in the trial) 
suggested benefit of sacubitril-valsartan versus val-
sartan alone (rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95).3

In a subgroup of 520 patients with L VEF 44% to

of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With 
an Aldosterone Antagonist), spironolactone reduced 
the risk of the primary composite endpoint of car-

tated sudden death, which was mostly caused by a 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality with spirono-
lactone and among patients enrolled in North and 
South America.6 Spironolactone is preferred among 
HFmrEF patients with poorly controlled hyperten-

COR LOE Recommendation
1 B-R1. In patients with HFimpEF after treatment, 
GDMT should be continued to prevent relapse 
of HF and LV dysfunction, even in patients who 
may become asymptomatic.1
Synopsis
Although GDMT can result in improvement in symptoms, 
functional capacity, L VEF, and reverse remodeling in 
patients with HFrEF,2 in most patients, L V function and 
structural abnormalities do not fully normalize, and symp-
toms and biomarker abnormalities may persist or reoc-
cur. Many patients deemed to have recovered from HF 
with resolution of symptoms and improvement of L VEF 
and natriuretic peptide levels will relapse after withdrawal 
of GDMT.1 Resolution of symptoms and improvement in 
cardiac function and biomarkers after treatment does not 
reflect full and sustained recovery but, rather, remission, 
which requires treatment to be maintained.3 Stage C HF 
patients are defined as patients with structural heart dis-
ease with previous or current symptoms of HF. In those 
patients who do not improve (ie, patients who remain symptomatic or with L V dysfunction), GDMT should not 
only be continued but also optimized.

1. In an open-label RCT,1 phased withdrawal of HF 
medications in patients with previous DCM—who 
were now asymptomatic, whose L VEF had improved 
from <40% to ≥50%, whose left ventricular end-
diastolic volume (L VEDV) had normalized, and who 
had an NT-proBNP concentration <250 ng/L—
resulted in relapse of cardiomyopathy and HF 
in 40% of the patients within 6 months. Relapse 
was defined by at least 1 of these: 1) a reduction 
in L VEF by >10% and <50%; 2) an increase in 
L VEDV by >10% and to higher than the normal 
range; 3) a 2-fold rise in NT-proBNP concentration 
and to >400 ng/L; or 4) clinical evidence of HF. 
Treatment was withdrawn successfully in only 50% 
of patients.1 Secondary analyses showed worsening 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores, 
a substantial reduction in L VEF, and nonsignificant 
increases in NT-proBNP and L V volumes with with-
drawal of HF medications.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure GuidelineSynopsis
HFpEF (L VEF ≥ 50%) is highly prevalent, accounting 
for up to 50% of all patients with HF, and is associ-
ated with significant morbidity and mortality.14 HFpEF 
is a heterogenous disorder, contributed to by comor-
bidities that include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, 
CAD, CKD, and specific causes such as cardiac amy-
loidosis.15–17 Clinical trials have used variable defini-
tions of HFpEF (eg, L VEF ≥ 40%, 45%, or 50%, and 
the varying need for accompanying evidence of struc-
tural heart disease or elevated levels of natriuretic 
peptides).18 Until recently, clinical trials had been 
generally disappointing, with no benefit on mortality 
and marginal benefits on HF hospitalizations.5,8,11,19,20 
Currently, recommended management is that used 
for HF in general with use of diuretics to reduce 
congestion and improve symptoms (see Section 
7 .1.1 for recommendations for nonpharmacological 
management and Section 7 .2 for recommendations 
for diuretics), identification and treatment of spe-
cific causes such as amyloidosis, and management 
of contributing comorbidities such as hypertension, 
CAD, and AF (see Section 10.2 for recommendations 
on management of AF). Figure 12 summarizes COR 
1, 2a, and 2b for HFpEF.Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The role of blood pressure control is well established 
for the prevention of HF, as well as for reduction 
of other cardiovascular events and HF mortality in 
patients without prevalent baseline HF.1–3,21–24 The 
SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention) 
trial and meta-analyses established that more 
intensive blood pressure control in patients with 
high cardiovascular risk significantly reduces HF 
and other cardiovascular outcomes.2,3,25 In recent 
clinical practice guidelines for hypertension, blood 
pressure targets in HFpEF are extrapolated from 
those for treatment of patients with hypertension 
in general.26 However, the optimal blood pressure 
goal and antihypertensive regimens are not known 
for patients with HFpEF. RAAS antagonists includ-
ing ACEi, ARB, MRA, and possibly ARNi, could be 
first-line agents given experience with their use in 
HFpEF trials.8,10,16,20,27 ,28 Beta blockers may be used 
to treat hypertension in patients with a history of 
MI,27 symptomatic CAD, or AF with rapid ventricular 
response. These effects need to be balanced with 
the potential contribution of chronotropic incompe-
tence to exercise intolerance in some patients.29
2. EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome 
Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with 
Preserved Ejection Fraction) showed a significant 
benefit of the SGL T2i, empagliflozin, in symptom-
atic patients with HF with L VEF >40% and ele-
vated natriuretic peptides.30 The 21% reduction 
in the primary composite endpoint of time to HF 
hospitalization or cardiovascular death was driven 
mostly by a significant 29% reduction in time to HF 
hospitalization (nonsignificant lower cardiovascular 
death [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76-1.0]), with no benefit 
on all-cause mortality. Empagliflozin also resulted in 
a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, 
decrease in the slope of the eGFR decline, and a 
modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks. Of note, 
the benefit was similar irrespective of the pres-
ence or absence of diabetes at baseline. Although 
the benefit in the primary endpoint did not have a 
significant interaction by L VEF subgroups (<50%, 
50%–<60%, and >60%),30 in a subgroup analysis 
by EF, there was a signal for lower benefit on the 
primary composite endpoint, first and recurrent HF 
hospitalizations at higher L VEFs >62.5%.31
3. Large, randomized clinical trial data are unavail-
able to specifically guide therapy in patients with 
HFpEF and AF. Currently, the comprehensive care 
of AF can be extrapolated from the clinical practice 
guidelines for AF, with individualization of strategies 
for rate or rhythm control in patients with HFpEF 
(see also Section 10.2, “Management of Atrial

considered as first-line agents for heart rate con-
trol in patients with HFpEF, a recent smaller open-
label trial, RATE-AF in elderly patients with AF 
and symptoms of HF (most with preserved L VEF), 
compared the use of the beta blocker, bisoprolol, to 
digoxin.32 At 6 months, the primary endpoint of QOL 
was similar between the 2 groups. However, sev-
eral secondary QOL endpoints, functional capacity, 
and reduction in NT-proBNP favored digoxin at 12 
months. There was a similar heart rate reduction 
in both groups. Of note, more adverse events such 
as higher rates of dizziness, lethargy, and hypoten-
sion occurred with beta blockers than digoxin. The 
comprehensive care of AF is beyond the scope of 
these guidelines. AF-specific care recommenda-
tions can be found in separate ACC/AHA clinical 
practice guidelines.33,34
4. MRAs improve diastolic function in patients with 
HFpEF .35 The TOPCAT trial investigated the 
effects of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF. 
The small reduction (HR, 0.89) in the composite of 
death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitaliza-
tion was not statistically significant, although HF 
hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83); adverse 
effects of hyperkalemia and increasing creati-
nine levels were more common in the treatment 
group.5 A post hoc analysis6 showed efficacy in 
the Americas (HR 0.83) but not in Russia-Georgia 
(HR 1.10). A sample of the Russia-Georgia popu-
lation in the active treatment arm had nondetect-
able levels of a spironolactone metabolite. Post hoc 
analyses have limitations, but they suggest a pos-
sibility of benefit in appropriately selected patients 
with symptomatic HFpEF (L VEF ≥45%, elevated 
BNP level or HF admission within 1 year, eGFR 
>30 mL/min/1.73 m2, creatinine <2.5 mg/dL, and 
potassium <5.0 mEq/L). Furthermore, another 
post hoc analysis suggested that the potential effi-
cacy of spironolactone was greatest at the lower 
end of the L VEF spectrum.7 Careful monitoring of 
potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at 
initiation and follow-up are key to minimizing the 
risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function.
5. Although RAAS inhibition strategies have been 
successful in the treatment of HFrEF, and RAAS 
activation is suggested in HFpEF,36,37 clinical tri-
als with RAAS inhibition have not showed much 
benefit in patients HFpEF. In the CHARM-
Preserved (Candesartan in patients with chronic 
HF and preserved left-ventricular ejection frac-
tion) trial, patients with L VEF >40% were ran-
domized to an ARB, candesartan, or to placebo.38 
The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization) was not significantly differ-
ent between the 2 groups (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.77–1.03, P=0.118; covariate-adjusted HR, 0.86; 
P=0.051). Cardiovascular mortality was identical in 
the 2 groups; HF hospitalizations were lower in the 
candesartan arm, with borderline statistical signifi-
cance on the covariate-adjusted analysis only (HR, 
0.84; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00; P=0.047; unadjusted 
P=0.072). The number of individuals hospitalized 
for HF (reported by the investigator) was lower in 
the candesartan group than placebo (230 versus 
279; P=0.017). A post hoc analysis of the CHARM 
trials showed that improvement in outcomes with 
candesartan was greater at the lower end the L VEF 
spectrum.39 In a meta-analysis of 7694 patients 
with HFpEF in 4 trials evaluating ARB, there was 
no signal for benefit on cardiovascular mortality 
(HR, 1.02), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02), or HF 
hospitalization (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83–1.02).40,41

phase II RCT in patients with HFpEF (L VEF ≥45%), 
sacubitril-valsartan resulted in a lower level of 
NT-proBNP after 12 weeks of treatment compared 
with the ARB, valsartan.42 In the PARAGON-HF 
(Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin Receptor 
Neprilysin Inhibitor With Angiotensin Receptor 
Blocker Global Outcomes in Heart Failure and

trial, in 4822 patients with HFpEF (L VEF ≥45%, 
HF admission within 9 months or elevated natri-
uretic peptide levels, and eGFR ≥30 mL/min/m2), 
sacubitril-valsartan compared with valsartan did 
not achieve a significant reduction in the primary 
composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or 
total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations (rate 
ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.01; P=0.06).10 Given 
the primary outcome was not met, other analyses 
are exploratory. There was no benefit of sacubitril-
valsartan on cardiovascular death (HR, 0.95) or 
total mortality (HR, 0.97). There was a signal of 
benefit for the ARNi for HF hospitalizations (rate 
ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00; P=0.056). The 
occurrence of hyperkalemia and the composite 
outcome of decline in renal function favored sacu-
bitril-valsartan, but it was associated with a higher 
incidence of hypotension and angioedema. In pre-
specified subgroup analyses, a differential effect 
by L VEF and sex was noted. A benefit of sacubitril-
valsartan compared with valsartan was observed in 
patients with L VEF below the median (45%–57%;

Synopsis
Cardiac amyloidosis is a restrictive cardiomyopathy with 
extracellular myocardial protein deposition, most com-
monly monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (amyloid cardiomyopathy [AL-CM]) or transthyretin amyloidosis 
(ATTR-CM). ATTR can be caused by pathogenic vari-
ants in the transthyretin gene TTR (variant transthyretin 
amyloidosis, ATTRv) or wild-type transthyretin (wild-type 
transthyretin amyloidosis, ATTRwt). A diagnostic ap-
proach is outlined in Figure 13.9
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Diagnosis of ATTR-CM requires a high index of 
suspicion. L V thickening (wall thickness ≥14 mm) 
along with fatigue, dyspnea, or edema should trigger 
consideration of ATTR-CM, especially with discor-
dance between wall thickness on echocardiogram 
and QRS voltage on ECG,10 or other findings such 
as apical sparing of L V longitudinal strain impair-
ment on echocardiography and diffuse late-gado-
linium enhancement on cardiac MRI. ATTR-CM is 
prevalent in severe aortic stenosis,1 HFpEF ,2 car-
pal tunnel syndrome,3 lumbar spinal stenosis,4 and 
autonomic or sensory polyneuropathy.5 Practically, 
screening for the presence of a monoclonal light 
chain and technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) 
scan can be ordered at the same time for con-
venience, but the results of the 99mTc-PYP scan 
are interpreted only on the context of a nega-
tive monoclonal light chain screen. 99mTc-PYP  
scans may be positive even in AL amyloidosis7 and, 
thus, a bone scintigraphy scan alone, without con-
comitant testing for light chains, cannot distinguish 
ATTR-CM from AL-CM. Serum free light chain 
(FLC) concentration and serum and urine immu-
nofixation electrophoresis (IFE) are assessed to 
rule out AL-CM. IFE is preferred because serum 
plasma electrophoresis and urine plasma electro-
phoresis are less sensitive. Together, measurement 
of serum IFE, urine IFE, and serum FLC is >99% 
sensitive for AL amyloidosis.6,11
2. The use of 99mTc bone-avid compounds for bone 
scintigraphy allows for noninvasive diagnosis 
of ATTR-CM.7 99mTc compounds include PYP, 
3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid, 
and hydromethylene diphosphonate, and PYP 
is used in the United States. In the absence of a 
light-chain abnormality, the 99mTc-PYP scan is diag-
nostic of ATTR-CM if there is grade 2/3 cardiac 
uptake or an H/CL ratio of >1.5. In fact, the pres-
ence of grade 2/3 cardiac uptake in the absence 
of a monoclonal protein in serum or urine has a 
very high specificity and positive predictive value 
for ATTR-CM.7 SPECT is assessed in all positive 
scans to confirm that uptake represents myocar-
dial retention of the tracer and not blood pool or rib

Synopsis
For patients with ATTR-CM and EF ≤40%, GDMT may 
be poorly tolerated. The vasodilating effects of ARNi, 
ACEi, and ARB may exacerbate hypotension, especially 
with amyloid-associated autonomic dysfunction. Beta 
blockers may worsen HF symptoms as patients with AT -
TR-CM rely on heart rate response to maintain cardiac 
output. The benefit of ICDs in ATTR-CM has not been 
studied in randomized trials, and a case-control study 
showed unclear benefit.5 CRT has not been studied in 
ATTR-CM with HFrEF. Disease-modifying therapies in-
clude TTR silencers (disrupt hepatic synthesis via mRNA 
inhibition/degradation: inotersen and patisiran), TTR 
stabilizers (prevent misfolding/deposition: diflunisal and 
tafamidis), and TTR disruptors (target tissue clearance: 
doxycycline, tauroursodeoxycholic acid [TUDCA], and 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate [EGCG] in green tea). Light 
chain cardiac amyloidosis is managed by hematology-
oncology specialists and beyond the scope of cardiolo-
gists, but diagnosis is often made by cardiologists when 
cardiac amyloid becomes manifest (Figure 13). AL amy-
loidosis is treatable, and patients with AL amyloidosis 
with cardiac involvement should promptly be referred to 
hematology-oncology for timely treatment. Inotersen and 
patisiran are associated with slower progression of am-
yloidosis-related polyneuropathy in ATTRv-CM.6,7 There 
are ongoing trials of the impact of inotersen and pati-
siran and newer generation mRNA inhibitors-degraders 
on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. There is limited 
benefit of diflunisal,8 doxycycline plus TUDCA,9,10 and 
EGCG,11 on surrogate endpoints such as L V mass, but 
the impact of these agents on cardiovascular morbid-
ity and mortality has not been assessed. Evaluation and 
management of autonomic dysfunction, volume status, 
and arrhythmia are important.Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Tafamidis is currently the only therapy to improve 
cardiovascular outcomes in ATTR-CM.1 Tafamidis 
binds the thyroxin-binding site of TTR. In the 
ATTR-ACT (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in 
Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy) 
clinical trial, a randomized trial of patients with 
ATTRwt-CM or ATTRv-CM and NYHA class I to 
III symptoms, tafamidis had lower all-cause mor-
tality (29.5% versus 42.9%) and lower cardio-
vascular-related hospitalization (0.48 versus 0.70 
per year) after 30 months.1 There was a higher 
rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in 
patients with NYHA class III HF, potentially attrib-
utable to longer survival during a more severe 
period of disease. Given that tafamidis prevents 
but does not reverse amyloid deposition, tafami-
dis is expected to have greater benefit when 
administered early in the disease course. As the 
survival curves separate after 18 months, patients 
for whom noncardiac disease is not expected to 
limit survival should be selected. Benefit has not 
been observed in patients with class IV symp-
toms, severe aortic stenosis, or impaired renal 
function (eGFR <25 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2 body 
surface area). Tafamidis is available in 2 formula-
tions: tafamidis meglumine is available in 20-mg 
capsules; and the FDA-approved dose is 80 mg 
(4 capsules) once daily. Tafamidis is also avail-
able in 61-mg capsules; the FDA-approved dose 
for this new formulation is 61 mg once daily.
2. One model-based analyses used the results of 
the ATTR-ACT study1 to evaluate the cost-effec-
tiveness of chronic tafamidis compared with no 
amyloidosis-specific therapy among patients with 
wild-type or variant transthyretin amyloidosis and 
NYHA class I to III HF.2 With assumptions that 
tafamidis remained effective beyond the clinical 
trial duration, they estimated tafamidis increased 
average survival by 1.97 years and QAL Y by 1.29. 
Despite these large clinical benefits, tafamidis 
(with an annual cost of $225 000) had an incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio >$180 000 per 
QAL Y gained, the benchmark used by this guide-
line for low value. The cost of tafamidis would 
need to decrease by approximately 80% for it 
to be intermediate value with a cost per QAL Y 
<$180 000.
3. Intracardiac thrombosis occurs in approximately 
one-third of patients with cardiac amyloidosis, in 
some cases in the absence of diagnosed AF3,4,12

cardiac thrombi in a retrospective study.4 The

Recommendation for Specialty Referral for Advanced HF
COR LOE Recommendation
1 C-LD1. In patients with advanced HF, when consistent 
with the patient’s goals of care, timely refer-
ral for HF specialty care is recommended to 
review HF management and assess suitability 
for advanced HF therapies (eg, LVAD, cardiac 
transplantation, palliative care, and palliative 
inotropes).1–6
Synopsis
A subset of patients with chronic HF will continue to 
progress and develop persistently severe symptoms 
despite maximum GDMT. Several terms have been used to describe this population, including “end-stage,” 
“advanced,” and “refractory” HF. In 2018, the European 
Society of Cardiology updated its definition of advanced 
HF (Table 16), which now includes 4 distinct criteria.1 
The revised definition focuses on refractory symptoms 
rather than cardiac function and more clearly acknowl-
edges that advanced HF can occur in patients without 
severely reduced EF, including those with isolated RV 
dysfunction, uncorrectable valvular or congenital heart 
disease, and in patients with preserved and mildly re-
duced EF.1,3 The INTERMACS (Interagency Registry 
for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) has 
developed 7 profiles that further stratify patients with 
advanced HF (Table 17).7
Determining that HF and not a concomitant pulmonary 
disorder is the basis of dyspnea is important. Severely 
symptomatic patients presenting with a new diagnosis 
of HF can often improve substantially if they are initially 
stabilized. Patients should also be evaluated for nonad-
herence to medications.8–11 Finally, a careful review of 
medical management should be conducted to verify that 
all therapies likely to improve clinical status have been 
considered.

tion or cardiogenic shock, they may no longer qualify 
for advanced therapies.19,20 A complete assessment 
of the patient is not required before referral, because 
comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment of car-
diac disease and comorbid conditions is routinely 
performed when evaluating patients for advanced 
therapies.19,20 Decisions around evaluation and use 
of advanced therapies should be informed by the pa-
tient’s values, goals, and preferences. Discussion with Table 16. ESC Definition of Advanced HF
All these criteria must be present despite optimal guideline-directed treatment:
1. Severe and persistent symptoms of HF (NYHA class III [advanced] or IV)
2. Severe cardiac dysfunction defined by ≥1 of these:
  LVEF ≤30%
  Isolated RV failure
  Nonoperable severe valve abnormalities
  Nonoperable severe congenital heart disease
  EF ≥40%, elevated natriuretic peptide levels and evidence of significant 
diastolic dysfunction
3. Hospitalizations or unplanned visits in the past 12 mo for episodes of:
  Congestion requiring high-dose intravenous diuretics or diuretic com-
binations
  Low output requiring inotropes or vasoactive medications
  Malignant arrhythmias
4. Severe impairment of exercise capacity with inability to exercise or low 
6-minute walk test distance (<300 m) or peak VO2 (<12–14 mL/kg/min) 
estimated to be of cardiac origin
Criteria 1 and 4 can be met in patients with cardiac dysfunction (as 
described in criterion 2) but who also have substantial limitations as a 
result of other conditions (eg, severe pulmonary disease, noncardiac 
cirrhosis, renal disease). The therapeutic options for these patients may 
be more limited.

Recommendation for Nonpharmacological Management: Advanced HF
COR LOE Recommendation
2b C-LD1. For patients with advanced HF and hypona-
tremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce 
congestive symptoms is uncertain.1–4
Synopsis
Hyponatremia and diuretic-refractory congestion is 
common in advanced HF and is associated with poor 
clinical5,6 and patient-reported outcomes.7 Moreover, 
improvement in hyponatremia has been shown to 
improve clinical outcomes.8,9 Fluid restriction is com-
monly prescribed for patients with hyponatremia in 
acute HF but only improves hyponatremia modestly.1 
Although restricting fluid is a common recommenda-
tion for patients with HF, evidence in this area is of low 
quality,10 and many studies have not included patients 
with advanced HF specifically. Moreover, fluid restric-tion has limited-to-no effect on clinical outcomes or 
diuretic use.4 Although HF nutritional counseling typi-
cally focuses on restricting sodium and fluid, patients 
with advanced HF have the greatest risk of developing 
cachexia or malnutrition.11 Hence, dietary restrictions 
and recommendation should be both evidence-based 
and comprehensive.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. In a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decom-
pensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hypo-
natremia marginally.1 A registered dietitian-guided 
fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved 
NYHA functional classification and leg edema in 
patients with HFrEF who were not in stage D HF,2 
and fluid restriction improved QOL in a pilot RCT of 
patients with HFrEF and HFpEF (NYHA class I to 
IV).3 In a meta-analysis of RCTs on fluid restriction 
in HF in general, restricted fluid intake compared 
with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced 
hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, 
the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum cre-
atinine, or serum sodium levels.4 The validity of a 
previous trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid 
restriction in HF is in serious question.12Table 17. INTERMACS Profiles
Profile* Profile Description Features
1 Critical cardiogenic shock Life-threatening hypotension and rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support, with critical organ hypoperfusion 
often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate levels.
2 Progressive decline “Dependent” on inotropic support but nonetheless shows signs of continuing deterioration in nutrition, renal 
function, fluid retention, or other major status indicator. Can also apply to a patient with refractory volume over-
load, perhaps with evidence of impaired perfusion, in whom inotropic infusions cannot be maintained because 
of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance.
3 Stable but inotrope dependent Clinically stable on mild-moderate doses of intravenous inotropes (or has a temporary circulatory support de-
vice) after repeated documentation of failure to wean without symptomatic hypotension, worsening symptoms, 
or progressive organ dysfunction (usually renal).
4 Resting symptoms on oral 
therapy at homePatient who is at home on oral therapy but frequently has symptoms of congestion at rest or with activities of 
daily living (dressing or bathing). He or she may have orthopnea, shortness of breath during dressing or bath-
ing, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal discomfort, nausea, poor appetite), disabling ascites, or severe 
lower extremity edema.
5 Exertion intolerant Patient who is comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity, living predominantly within the house or 
housebound.
6 Exertion limited Patient who is comfortable at rest without evidence of fluid overload but who is able to do some mild ac-
tivity. Activities of daily living are comfortable, and minor activities outside the home such as visiting friends 
or going to a restaurant can be performed, but fatigue results within a few minutes or with any meaningful 
physical exertion.
7 Advanced NYHA class III Patient who is clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, despite a history of previous 
decompensation that is not recent. This patient is usually able to walk more than a block. Any decompensation 
requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should make this person a Patient 
Profile 6 or lower.

*Modifier options: Profiles 3 to 6 can be modified for patients with recurrent decompensations leading to frequent (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 
mo) emergency department visits or hospitalizations for intravenous diuretics, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy. Profile 3 can be modified in this manner if the 
patient is usually at home. If a Profile 7 patient meets the modification of frequent hospitalizations, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse. Other modifier 
options include arrhythmia, which should be used in the presence of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias contributing to the overall clinical course (eg, frequent ICD 
shocks or requirement of external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly); or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

3: Harm B-R3. In patients with HF, long-term use of either 
continuous or intermittent intravenous inotropic 
agents, for reasons other than palliative care or 
as a bridge to advanced therapies, is potentially 
harmful.5,6,8–11
Synopsis
Despite improving hemodynamic compromise, positive 
inotropic agents have not shown improved survival in 
patients with HF in either the hospital or the outpatient 
setting.6 Regardless of their mechanism of action (eg, in-
hibition of phosphodiesterase, stimulation of adrenergic or dopaminergic receptors, calcium sensitization), paren-
teral inotropes remain an option to help the subset of 
patients with HF who are refractory to other therapies 
and are suffering consequences from end-organ hypo-
perfusion. In hospitalized patients presenting with doc-
umented severe systolic dysfunction who present with 
low blood pressure and significantly low cardiac index, 
short-term, continuous intravenous inotropic support 
may be reasonable to maintain systemic perfusion and 
preserve end-organ performance.8,11,12 There continues 
to be lack of robust evidence to suggest the clear benefit 
of 1 inotrope over another.13 To minimize adverse effects, 
lower doses of parenteral inotropic drugs are preferred, 
although the development of tachyphylaxis should be ac-
knowledged, and the choice of agent may need to be 
changed during longer periods of support. Similarly, the 
ongoing need for inotropic support and the possibility of 
discontinuation should be regularly assessed. Table 20 
compares commonly used inotropes.Table 18. Clinical Indicators of Advanced HF1,2,12,13,23–37

1. More prolonged use of inotropes as “bridge” ther-
apy for those awaiting either heart transplantation 
or MCS may have benefit in reducing pulmonary 
hypertension and maintaining end-organ perfusion 
beyond initial stabilization of patients.1–4
2. The use of inotropes for palliation does carry 
with it risks for arrhythmias and catheter-related 
infections, although the presence of an ICD 
does decrease the mortality associated with 
arrhythmias. This risk should be shared with 
patients if there is planned use of inotropes 
in a patient without an ICD, or in whom the 
preference is to deactivate the ICD for pallia-
tive purposes. The rate of inappropriate shocks 
for sinus tachycardia is relatively low, and the 
concomitant use of beta blockers may help in 
these patients. Patients may elect to have their 
shocking devices deactivated, especially if they 
receive numerous shocks.14,15
3. With the currently available inotropic agents, 
the benefit of hemodynamic support and sta-
bilization may be compromised by increased 
myocardial oxygen demand and increased 
arrhythmic burden. As newer agents are devel-
oped, more options may not have these known 
risks. There are investigational inotropic agents 
that may provide more options for the manage-

1. Durable L VADs should be considered in selected 
patients with NHYA class IV symptoms who are 
deemed dependent on IV inotropes or tempo-
rary MCS. The magnitude of the survival ben-
efit for durable L VAD support in advanced NYHA 
class IV patients has progressively improved, 
with a 2-year survival >80% in recent trials with 
newer generation L VADs, which approaches 
the early survival after cardiac transplantation.2 
The 2020 INTERMACS (Interagency Registry 
for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) 
report showed that 87 .6% of recent durable L VAD 
recipients were categorized as INTERMACS 1 to 
3 before their implant surgery.10 It also showed 
improved mean survival, >4 years for the desti-
nation L VAD cohort, and >5 years for bridge-to-
transplant patients. Durable L VAD support has also 
achieved impressive functional improvement and 
QOL improvement in multiple trials,2,7 ,31 although 
patients remain tethered to external electrical 
power supplies via a percutaneous lead can limit 
this improvement. Most patients require rehospi-
talization within the first year post-implant. These 
factors emphasize the need for a thorough evalu-
ation and patient education before the decision to 
proceed with the treatment. Appropriate patient 
selection benefits from review by a multidisci-
plinary team that typically includes an HF cardi-
ologist, surgeon, social worker, nurse, pharmacist, 
dietician, and a palliative medicine specialist.
2. Durable MCS should be considered in patients 
with NHYA class IV symptoms despite optimal 
medical therapy or those deemed dependent 
on IV inotropes. Destination therapy MCS pro-
vides considerable survival advantage in addition 
to improvement in functional status and health-
related QOL.1,7 ,12,32,33 There is no clear 1-risk model to assess patient risk for complications, but fac-
tors such as elevated central venous pressure, 
pulmonary hypertension, and coagulopathy have 
been linked to poorer outcomes.15,34–36 In patients 
who are unable to tolerate anticoagulation after 
repeated challenges, implantation of a durable 
MCS is associated with excess morbidity; incidents 
of pump thrombosis, hemolysis, and ischemic neu-
rologic events have been linked to subtherapeu-
tic international normalized ratios.37–41 In addition, 
implantation of MCS in patients with INTERMACS 
profile of 1 has been associated with poorer out-
come, while those ambulatory patients with profiles 
5 to 7 might be too well to have large significant 
benefit, depending on their symptom burden.19 For 
patients who are initially considered to be trans-
plant ineligible because of pulmonary hyperten-
sion, obesity, overall frailty, or other reasons, MCS 
can provide time to reverse or modify these con-
ditions.35,42–44 Continuing and uptitrating GDMT in 
patients with durable MCS is recommended.45
3. Multiple studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
ventricular assist device implantation for advanced 
HF between 2012 and 2017 .20,21,23 They consis-
tently found device implantation was of low eco-
nomic value, with incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios of $200 000 per QAL Y gained compared 
with medical therapy alone among patients who 
potentially underwent subsequent heart transplant 
and those who were ineligible for heart transplant. 
In these studies, costs after implantation remained 
high given high rates of complication and rehos-
pitalization. However, these studies used earlier 
estimates of post-implant outcomes and compli-
cation-related costs that have generally improved 
over time with better care and newer devices.46–48 
Additionally, limited recent data suggest improve-
ment in health care costs and intermediate eco-
nomic value with L VAD among patients with 
advanced HF who are either eligible or ineligible 
for subsequent heart transplant.22,24 The improve-
ment may result from lower complication rates, 
increased survival, lower implant costs, and higher 
estimated QOL. However, given the conflicting 
data and limited analyses of contemporary data, 
the current value of L VAD therapy is uncertain.
4. Temporary MCS can help stabilize patients and 
allow time for decisions about the appropriateness 
of transitions to definitive management, such as 
durable MCS as a bridge or destination therapy, 
stabilization until cardiac transplantation or, in the 
case of improvement and recovery, suitability for 
device removal.45 These patients often present in 
cardiogenic shock that cannot be managed solely 
with IV inotropes and in whom other organ function 
is at risk. Temporary MCS is also appropriate for

cated to improve survival and QOL.1–3
Value Statement: 
Intermediate Value 
(C-LD)2. In patients with stage D (advanced) HF despite 
GDMT, cardiac transplantation provides inter-
mediate economic value.4
Synopsis
The evidence that cardiac transplantation provides a 
mortality and morbidity benefit to selected patients 
with stage D HF (refractory, advanced) is derived from 
observational cohorts. Datasets from the International 
Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation1 and Unit-
ed Network of Organ Sharing2 document the median 
survival of adult transplant recipients to be now >12 
years; the median survival of patients with stage D HF 
without advanced therapies is <2 years. For compari-
son, the risk of death becomes greater than survival 
between 3 and 4 years on an L VAD, regardless of im-
plant strategy (eg, bridge-to-transplant, bridge-to-de-
cision, destination therapy).3 Improvements in pre- and 
posttransplant management have also increased more 
patients to be eligible for transplant, and treated rejec-
tion rates in the first year after transplantation are now 
<15%.1 Minimizing waitlist mortality while maximizing 
posttransplant outcomes continues to be a priority in 
heart transplantation and was addressed with the re-
cent changes in donor allocation policy instituted in 
2018.5 Several analyses6–11 have confirmed a decrease 
in waitlist mortality as well as an increase in the use of 
temporary circulatory support devices, graft ischemic 
times, and distances between donor and recipient hos-
pitals. The impact on posttransplant survival remains 
uncertain. Multiorgan transplantation remains uncom-
mon and reserved for highly selected candidates. In 
2018, 7% of all heart transplants involved another or-
gan, in addition to the heart.1

1. Cardiac transplantation is the established treat-
ment for eligible patients with stage D HF refrac-
tory to GDMT, device, and surgical optimization. 
The survival of adult recipients who received a 
transplantation between 2011 and 2013 at 1, 3, 
and 5 years is 90.3%, 84.7%, and 79.6%, respec-
tively.2 Conditional survival now approaches 15 years.1 Cardiac transplantation also improves 
functional status and health-related QOL.12–15 
Good outcomes can be achieved in patients not 
only with HF that is primarily cardiovascular in 
origin, including reversible pulmonary hyperten-
sion,16 congenital heart disease,17 and hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy,18 but also in patients with 
systemic conditions complicated by HF, such as 
muscular dystrophy,19 sarcoidosis,20 and amyloi-
dosis.21 CPET can refine candidate prognosis 
and selection.22–28 Appropriate patient selection 
should include integration of comorbidity burden, 
caretaker status, and goals of care. The listing 
criteria, evaluation, and management of patients 
undergoing cardiac transplantation are described 
by the International Society for Heart and Lung 
Transplantation.29 The United Network of Organ 
Sharing Heart Transplant Allocation Policy was 
revised in 2018 with a broader geographic shar-
ing policy and a 6-tiered system to better priori-
tize more unstable patients and minimize waitlist 
mortality.5–11
2. One study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
heart transplantation compared with medical 
therapy among patients with inotrope-dependent 
advanced HF.30 This analysis found transplanta-
tion was of intermediate value. The results were 
similar across a broad range of patient age, wait-
list duration, and monthly mortality risk with medi-
cal therapy.

warrants consideration of recommendations in Sec-
tion 9.5, “Evaluation and Management of Cardiogenic 
Shock,” but any concern for worsening hypoperfusion 
should also trigger involvement of the multidisciplinary 
team for hemodynamic assessment and intervention. 
Initial triage includes recognition of patients with ACS 
for whom urgent revascularization may be indicated. 
In the absence of ischemic disease, recent onset with 
accelerating hemodynamic decompensation may rep-
resent inflammatory heart disease, particularly when 
accompanied by conduction block or ventricular ar-
rhythmias.7, 8 However, most HF hospitalizations for de-
compensation are not truly “acute” but follow a gradual 
increase of cardiac filling pressures on preexisting 
structural heart disease, often with precipitating fac-
tors that can be identified3,6 (Table 21). Some patients 
present with pulmonary edema and severe hyperten-
sion, which require urgent treatment to reduce blood 
pressure, more commonly in patients with preserved 
L VEF. Patients require assessment and management 
of ischemia, arrhythmia and other precipitating factors 
and comorbidities. The presenting profile, reversible 
factors, appropriate workup for the cause of HF includ-
ing ischemic and nonischemic causes, comorbidities, 
and potential for GDMT titration inform the plan of care 
to optimize the disease trajectory.5
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1.  and 2.  Most patients admitted with HF have 
clinical evidence of congestion without appar-
ent hypoperfusion.1–5,9,10 Although elevations of 
right- and left-sided cardiac filling pressures 
are usually proportional in decompensation of 
chronic HF with low EF, up to 1 in 4 patients 
have a mismatch between right- and left-sided 
filling pressures.9–11 Disproportionate elevation of right-sided pressures, particularly with TR, 
hinders effective decongestion. Disproportionate 
elevation of left-sided filling pressures may be 
underrecognized as the cause of dyspnea in the 
absence of jugular venous distention and edema. 
Elevated natriuretic peptides can help identify 
HF in the urgent care setting but with less utility 
in certain situations, including decreased sen-
sitivity with obesity and HFpEF and decreased 
specificity in the setting of sepsis. Resting hypo-
perfusion is often underappreciated in patients 
with chronic HF but can be suspected from nar-
row pulse pressure and cool extremities1,9 and 
by intolerance to neurohormonal antagonists. 
Elevated serum lactate levels may indicate hypo-
perfusion and impending cardiogenic shock.12 
When initial clinical assessment does not sug-
gest congestion or hypoperfusion, symptoms 
of HF may be a result of transient ischemia, 
arrhythmias, or noncardiac disease such as 
chronic pulmonary disease or pneumonia, and 
more focused hemodynamic assessment may 
be warranted. Assessment of arrhythmia, device 
profiles such as percent L V pacing versus RV 
pacing in patients with CRT, and device therapy 
and shocks in patients with ICD can provide 
important information.
3. Hospitalization for HF is a sentinel event that 
signals worse prognosis and the need to restore 
hemodynamic compensation but also provides 
key opportunities to redirect the disease trajec-
tory. During the HF hospitalization, the approach 
to management should include and address 
precipitating factors, comorbidities, and previ-
ous limitations to ongoing disease manage-
ment related to social determinants of health.1 
Patients require assessment and management 
of ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitat-
ing factors and comorbidities. The presenting 
profile, reversible factors, appropriate work-up 
for cause of HF including ischemic and non-
ischemic causes, comorbidities, disease trajec-
tory, and goals of care should be addressed. 
Establishment of optimal volume status is a 
major goal, and patients with residual conges-
tion merit careful consideration for further inter-
vention before and after discharge, because 
they face higher risk for rehospitalization and 
death.2–5 The disease trajectory for patients hos-
pitalized with reduced EF is markedly improved 
by optimization of recommended medical ther-
apies, which should be initiated or increased 
toward target doses once the efficacy of diure-
sis has been shown.13,14Table 21. Common Factors Precipitating HF Hospitalization

Synopsis
Hospitalization for HFrEF is a critical opportunity to 
continue, initiate, and further optimize GDMT.23–25 
Continuation of oral GDMT during hospitalization 
for HF has been shown in registries to lower risk of 
postdischarge death and readmission compared with 
discontinuation.1–5 Initiation of oral GDMT during hos-
pitalization for HF is associated with numerous clini-
cal outcome benefits.2,5,12,16,17 Based on data from the 
CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with 
Heart Failure) registry, however, only 73%, 66%, and 
33% of eligible patients with HFrEF were prescribed 
ACEi-ARB-ARNi, beta blockers, and MRA therapy, 
respectively.19 Furthermore, based on information ob-
tained from claims data, roughly 42% of patients are 
not prescribed any GDMT within 30 days postindex 
hospitalization,20 and 45% are prescribed either no oral 
GDMT or monotherapy within 1-year post-hospitaliza-
tion.21 In the management of patients with HFrEF in 
the community, very few receive target doses of oral 
GDMT.6 Moreover, most patients with HFrEF have no 
changes made to oral GDMT over 12 months,21 despite 
being discharged on suboptimal doses or no GDMT.22 It 
cannot be assumed that oral GDMT will be initiated or 
optimized after hospitalization for HFrEF.

1. In OPTIMIZE-HF (Organized Program to Initiate 
Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients 
with Heart Failure), discontinuation of beta 
blockers was associated with a higher risk for 
mortality compared with those continued on beta blockers.1 In a meta-analysis of observational 
and trial data, discontinuation of beta blockers in 
hospitalized patients with HFrEF also was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality, 
short-term mortality, and the combined endpoint 
of short-term rehospitalization or mortality.4 
Withholding or reducing beta-blocker therapy 
should be considered in patients with marked 
volume overload or marginal low cardiac output. 
In the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure 
(GWTG-HF) registry, withdrawal of ACEi-ARB 
among patients hospitalized with HFrEF was 
associated with higher rates of postdischarge 
mortality and readmission.2 In the COACH 
(Coordinating study evaluating Outcomes of 
Advising and Counselling in Heart failure) study, 
continuation of spironolactone among hospital-
ized patients with HFrEF was associated with 
lower 30-day mortality and HF rehospitaliza-
tion.3 From the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) study, discontinuation of any oral 
GDMT among patients hospitalized with HFrEF 
was associated with higher mortality risk.5 Oral 
GDMT should not be withheld for mild or tran-
sient reductions in blood pressure6–9 or mild 
deteriorations in renal function.10,11 True contra-
indications are rare, such as advanced degree 
atrioventricular block for beta blockers in the 
absence of pacemakers; cardiogenic shock that 
may preclude use of certain medications until 
resolution of shock state; or angioedema for 
ACEi or ARNi.
2. In CHAMP-HF, very few patients with HF and 
SBP <110 mm Hg received target doses of beta 
blockers (17 .5%) ACEi-ARB (6.2 %), or ARNi 
(1.8%).6 In PARADIGM-HF, patients with HF and 
lower SBP on sacubitril-valsartan had the same 
tolerance and relative benefit over enalapril 
compared with patients with higher SBP.7 From 
the SENIORS (Study of Effects of Nebivolol 
Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization 
in Seniors With Heart Failure) trial, nebivolol had 
equivalent tolerance and benefits irrespective of 
SB P.8 In Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial), 
decreases in SBP did not offset the beneficial 
effects of valsartan on HF morbidity.9 In patients 
with HF on oral GDMT, small to moderate 
worsening of renal function (defined as ≥ 20% 
decrease in eGFR in that study) was not asso-
ciated with AKI.10 Moreover, it has been shown 
that spironolactone and beta blockers might be 
protective in patients with HF and worsening 
renal function.11

and 4-year all-cause mortality/all-cause read-
mission.14 Caution should be used when initiating 
beta blockers in patients who have required ino-
tropes during hospitalization. In GWTG-HF, initia-
tion of ACEi-ARB in patients hospitalized with 
HFrEF reduced 30-day and 1-year mortality.2 
Among patients hospitalized with HFrEF, initia-
tion of ACEi-ARB also is associated with lower 
risk of 30-day all-cause readmission and all-
cause mortality.15 In a claims study, initiation of 
MRA therapy at hospital discharge was associ-
ated with improved HF readmission but not mor-
tality or cardiovascular readmission among older 
adults hospitalized with HFrEF.16 In COACH, 
initiating spironolactone among patients hospi-
talized with HFrEF was associated with lower 
30-day mortality and HF rehospitalization.3 In 
the PIONEER-HF trial, ARNi use was associ-
ated with reduced NT-proBNP levels in patients 
hospitalized for acute decompensated HF with-
out increased rates of adverse events (worsen-
ing renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic 
hypotension, angioedema) when compared with 
enalapril.18 In the ARIC study, initiation of any oral 
GDMT was associated with reduced 1-year mor-
tality among patients hospitalized with HFrEF.5 In 
SOLOIST-WHF, initiation of sotagliflozin before 
or shortly after discharge reduced cardiovascular 
mortality and hospitalization.17
4. Nearly half (46%) of patients with HFrEF have 
no changes made to oral GDMT in the 12 
months after hospitalization despite many being 
discharged on suboptimal doses.21 From claims-
based studies, 42% of patients with HFrEF 
are not prescribed any GDMT within 30 days 
post-index hospitalization,20 and 45% are pre-
scribed either no oral GDMT or monotherapy 
within 1-year post-index hospitalization.21 From 
CHAMP-HF, initiation or dose increases of beta 
blockers, ACEi-ARB-ARNi, and MRA occur in 
≤10% of patients with HFrEF within 1 year of 
hospitalization.22 Very few eligible patients with 
HFrEF receive target doses of beta blockers 
(18.7%), ACEi-ARB (10.8%), or ARNi (2.0%).6 
Less than 1% of patients with HFrEF are on tar-
get doses of ACEi-ARB-ARNi, beta blockers, and 
MRA within 12 months of an index hospitaliza-
tion.22 For patients with HFrEF, there is a graded 
improvement in the risk of death or rehospitaliza-
tion with monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple 
therapy compared with no GDMT after an index 
hospitalization in Medicare claims data.219.3. Diuretics in Hospitalized Patients:

1 B-NR1. Patients with HF admitted with evidence of 
significant fluid overload should be promptly 
treated with intravenous loop diuretics to 
improve symptoms and reduce morbidity.1
1 B-NR2. For patients hospitalized with HF, therapy with 
diuretics and other guideline-directed medica-
tions should be titrated with a goal to resolve 
clinical evidence of congestion to reduce symp-
toms and rehospitalizations.1–6
1 B-NR3. For patients requiring diuretic treatment during 
hospitalization for HF, the discharge regimen 
should include a plan for adjustment of diuret-
ics to decrease rehospitalizations.7
2a B-NR4. In patients hospitalized with HF when diuresis 
is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs 
of congestion, it is reasonable to intensify the 
diuretic regimen using either: a. higher doses of 
intravenous loop diuretics.1,3); or b. addition of 
a second diuretic.3
Synopsis
Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most 
rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of 
congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to 
achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial 
doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that 
has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular bene-
fits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and 
symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent 
congestion scored at discharge has been associated 
with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most 
patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy 
during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of 
loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of 
symptoms and hospitalization.

hospitalized patients comparing intravenous loop 
diuretics to placebo, for which equipoise is consid-
ered unlikely.10
2. Monitoring HF treatment includes careful measure-
ment of fluid intake and output, vital signs, standing 
body weight at the same time each day, and clinical 
signs and symptoms of congestion and hypoperfu-
sion. Daily laboratory tests during active medication 
adjustment include serum electrolytes, urea nitrogen, 
and creatinine concentrations. Signs and symptoms 
of congestion have been specified as inclusion cri-
teria in recent trials of patients hospitalized for HF, in 
which resolution of these signs and symptoms has 
been defined as a goal to be achieved by hospital dis-
charge,1–6,8,9 as it has in the recent HF hospitalization 
pathway consensus document.11 Evidence of persis-
tent congestion at discharge has been reported in 
25% to 50% of patients,4,5,12 who have higher rates of 
mortality and readmission and are more likely to have 
elevated right atrial pressures, TR, and renal dysfunc-
tion. Diuresis should not be discontinued prematurely 
because of small changes in serum creatinine,13,14 
because elevations in the range of 0.3 mg/dL do not 
predict worse outcomes except when patients are 
discharged with persistent congestion. Decongestion 
often requires not only diuresis but also adjustment of 
other guideline-directed therapies, because elevated 
volume status and vasoconstriction can contribute to 
elevated filling pressures.
3. After discharge, ACEi-ARB, MRAs, and beta block-
ers all may decrease recurrent congestion leading 
to hospitalization in HFrEF. Despite these therapies, 
most patients with recent HF hospitalization require 
continued use of diuretics after discharge to pre-
vent recurrent fluid retention and hospitalization, 
as shown in a recent large observational analysis.7 
Increases in diuretic doses are frequently required 
early after discharge even in patients on all other 
currently recommended therapies for HFrEF.8 It 
is unknown how increased penetration of therapy 
with ARNi and SGL T2i will, in the future, affect the 
dosing of diuretics after discharge with HFrEF.
4. Titration of diuretics has been described in mul-
tiple recent trials of patients hospitalized with HF, 
often initiated with at least 2 times the daily home 
diuretic dose (mg to mg) administered intrave-
nously.1 Escalating attempts to achieve net diuresis 
include serial doubling of intravenous loop diuretic 
doses, which can be done by bolus or infusion, and 
sequential nephron blockade with addition of a 
thiazide diuretic, as detailed specifically in the pro-
tocol for the diuretic arms of the CARRESS and 
ROSE trials.3,9 In the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization 
Strategies Evaluation) trial, there were no signifi-
cant differences in patients’ global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when 
diuretic therapy was administered by bolus, com-
pared with continuous infusion or at a high dose 
compared with a low dose. Patients in the low-dose 
group were more likely to require a 50% increase in 
the dose at 48 hours than were those in the high-
dose group, and all treatment groups had higher 
doses of diuretics compared with baseline pread-
mission doses, underlining the necessity to inten-
sify and individualize diuretic regimen.1 MRAs have 
mild diuretics properties and addition of MRAs can 
help with diuresis in addition to significant cardio-
vascular benefits in patients with HF. Addition of 
low-dose dopamine to diuretic therapy in the set-
ting of reduced eGFR did not improve outcomes 
in a study that included patients with all EFs, but 
a subset analysis showed increased urine output 
and weight loss in patients with L VEF <0.40,9 with 
significant interaction of effect with L VEF. Bedside 
ultrafiltration initiated early after admission 
increased fluid loss, with decreased rehospitaliza-

COR LOE Recommendation
2b B-NR1. In patients who are admitted with decompen-
sated HF, in the absence of systemic hypoten-
sion, intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside 
may be considered as an adjuvant to diuretic 
therapy for relief of dyspnea.1,2
Synopsis
Vasodilators can be used in acute HF to acutely relieve 
symptoms of pulmonary congestion in selected patients. 
Although they may mitigate dyspnea and relieve pulmo-
nary congestion, their benefits have not been shown to 
have durable effects for either rehospitalization or mor-
tality benefit. In select patients who present with signs 
of hypoperfusion such as worsening renal function, even 
in the absence of hypotension, other escalation of care 
may need to be considered (see Section 8.3, “Inotropic 
Support,” and Section 9.5, “Evaluation and Management 
of Cardiogenic Shock”).

1. The role for directed vasodilators in acute decom-
pensated HF remains uncertain. Part of the rationale 
for their use is targeting pulmonary congestion, while 
trying to avoid some potential adverse consequences 
of loop diuretics. Patients with hypertension, coronary 
ischemia, or significant MR may be suitable candidates 
for the use of intravenous nitroglycerin. However, 
tachyphylaxis may develop within 24 hours, and up 
to 20% of those with HF may develop resistance to 
even high doses.3,4 Because of sodium nitroprusside’s 
potential for producing marked hypotension, invasive 
hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring (eg, an arte-
rial line) is typically required, and nitroprusside is usu-
ally used in the intensive care setting; longer infusions 
of the drug have been associated, albeit rarely, with 
thiocyanate and cyanide toxicity, particularly in the set-
ting of renal insufficiency and significant hepatic dis-
ease. Nitroprusside is potentially of value in severely 
congested patients with hypertension or severe MV 
regurgitation complicating L V dysfunction.5 Overall, 
there are no data that suggest that intravenous vaso-
dilators improve outcomes in the patient hospitalized 
with HF; as such, use of intravenous vasodilators is 
limited to the relief of dyspnea in the hospitalized HF 
patient with intact or high blood pressure.6,7

Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized

COR LOE Recommendation
1 B-R1. In patients hospitalized with HF, prophylaxis for 
VTE is recommended to prevent venous throm-
boembolic disease.1–3
Synopsis
HF has long been recognized as affording additional risk 
for venous thromboembolic disease. When patients are 
hospitalized for decompensated HF, or when patients with 
chronic stable HF are hospitalized for other reasons, they 
are at increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease. 
The risk may be associated with higher HF symptom bur-
den.4 This risk may extend for up to 2 years after hospi-
talization but is greatest in the first 30 days.5,6 The use of 
anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight 
heparin, unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux, or approved 
DOAC are used for the prevention of clinically symptomatic 
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.7, 8
Recommendation-Specific Supporting Text
1. Trials using available antithrombotic drugs often 
were not limited to patients with HF but included patients with acute illnesses, severe respiratory dis-
eases, or simply a broad spectrum of hospitalized 
medical patients.9–12 All included trials excluded 
patients perceived to have an elevated risk of 
bleeding complications or of toxicity from the spe-
cific agent tested (eg, enoxaparin in patients with 
compromised renal function). In some trials, aspirin 
was allowed but not controlled for as a confounding 
variable. Despite the increased risk for the develop-
ment of VTE in the 30 days after hospitalization, 
the data for extending prophylaxis to the immediate 
post-hospital period have shown decreased devel-
opment of VTE but were associated with increased 
bleeding events and overall do not appear to pro-
vide additional benefit.2,3,11 For patients admitted 
specifically for decompensated HF and with ade-
quate renal function (creatinine clearance, >30 
mL/min), randomized trials suggest that enoxaparin 
40 mg subcutaneously once daily,1,13 unfraction-
ated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 8 
or 12 hours,14–17 or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily11 
will radiographically reduce demonstrable venous 
thrombosis. Effects on mortality or clinically sig-
nificant pulmonary embolism rates are unclear. For 
obese patients, a higher dose of enoxaparin 60 mg 
once daily achieved target range of thromboprophy-
laxis without increased bleeding.12

AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guidelinea critical reduction in cardiac output manifest by end-
organ dysfunction.28 Hypotension (eg, SBP <90 mm 
Hg) is the primary clinical manifestation of shock but is 
not sufficient for the diagnosis. Additionally, end-organ 
hypoperfusion should be present as a consequence of 
cardiac dysfunction (Tables 22, 23, 24).29 Causes can 
be broadly separated into acute decompensations of 
chronic HF, acute myocardial dysfunction without prec-
edent HF, and survivors of cardiac arrest. In the case 
of acute MI, urgent revascularization is paramount. The 
approach to cardiogenic shock should include its early recognition, invasive hemodynamic assessment when 
there is insufficient clinical improvement to initial mea-
sures and providing appropriate pharmacological and 
MCS to optimize end-organ perfusion and prevent meta-
bolic complications. The evidence that supports the use 
of specific pharmacologic therapies and the nature of 
temporary MCS is primarily gleaned from observational 
retrospective datasets. Only a few randomized trials have 
been conducted to assess the most appropriate circula-
tory support device, and they have been limited by small Table 22. Suggested Shock Clinical Criteria*29

1. Intravenous inotropic support can increase 
cardiac output and improve hemodynamics in 
patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. 
Despite their ubiquitous use for initial manage-
ment of cardiogenic shock, there are few pro-
spective data and a paucity of randomized trials 
to guide their use.1–8 However, their broad avail-
ability, ease of administration, and clinician famil-
iarity favor such agents as the first therapeutic 
consideration when signs of organ hypoperfu-
sion persist despite empiric volume replacement 
and vasopressors. There is a lack of robust evi-
dence to suggest the clear benefit of one inotro-
pic agent over another in cardiogenic shock.30 In 
general, the choice of a specific inotropic agent 
is guided by blood pressure, concurrent arrhyth-
mias, and availability of drug.
2. Despite the lack of direct comparative data, 
the use of short-term MCS has dramatically 
increased.9–16,31,32 The hemodynamic benefits of 
the specific devices vary, and few head-to-head 
randomized comparisons exist.33–39 Randomized 
clinical trials are underway that will address the 
risks and benefits of one modality over another. 
Vascular, bleeding, and neurologic complications 
are common to MCS devices, and the risk of such 
complications should generally be considered in 
the calculation to proceed with such support.40 As 
much as possible, an understanding of a patient’s 
wishes, overall prognosis and trajectory, and 
assessment of therapeutic risk should precede the 
use of invasive temporary MCS.
3. Team-based cardiogenic shock management pro-
vides the opportunity for various clinicians to pro-
vide their perspective and input to the patient’s 
management.17–22 The escalation of either phar-
macological and mechanical therapies should 
be considered in the context of multidisciplinary 
teams of HF and critical care specialists, inter-
ventional cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons. 
Such teams should also be capable of provid-
ing appropriate palliative care. Most documented 
experiences have suggested outcomes improve 
after shock teams are instituted.17–22 In 1 such 
experience, the use of a shock team was asso-
ciated with improved 30-day all-cause mortality 
(HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.93) and reduced in-
hospital mortality (61.0% vs. 47 .9%; P =0.041).19
4. If time allows, escalation to MCS should be guided 
by invasively obtained hemodynamic data (eg, PA 
catheterization). Several observational experiences have associated PA catheterization use with 
improved outcomes, particularly in conjunction with 
short-term MCS.23–27 ,41 PA catheterization may also 
be useful when there is diagnostic uncertainty as 
to the cause of hypotension or end-organ dysfunc-
tion, particularly when a patient in shock is not 
responding to empiric initial shock measures.42
5. Transfer to centers capable of providing such sup-
port should be considered early in the assessment 
of a patient with cardiogenic shock and a trajec-
tory of worsening end-organ malperfusion.17–22,43 
The treatment of shock should be recognized as 
a temporizing strategy to support end-organ per-
fusion and blood pressure until the cause of the 
cardiac failure has either been treated (eg, revas-
cularization in ST-elevation MI) or recovery (eg, 
myocarditis) or a definitive solution to the cardiac 
failure can be accomplished (eg, durable L VAD 
or transplant). In many cases, pharmacological or 
MCS can provide sufficient time to address the 
appropriateness of more definitive therapies (eg, 
bridge-to-decision) with the patient, family, and the 
multidisciplinary shock team.

proved communication between health care profession-
als, systematic use and monitoring of GDMT, medication

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. HF disease management programs can help 
to organize the patient’s care across settings. 
Potential team members may include cardiologists, 
primary care clinicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, 
dieticians, social workers, and community health 
workers. A Cochrane systematic review of 47 RCTs 
of disease management interventions after hospi-
tal discharge found that interventions that use case 
management (case manager or nurse coordinates 
care for high-risk patients) or multidisciplinary 
approach may decrease all-cause mortality and 
rehospitalization.3 Disease management programs 
may comprise education, self-management, medi-
cation optimization, device management, weight 
monitoring, exercise and dietary advice, facilitated 
access to care during episodes of decompensation, 
and social and psychological support.14 Disease management programs coordinated by HF special-
ists, including HF nurses, may be best suited for 
patients with HFrEF; however, there are far fewer 
data on the effectiveness of disease management 
programs in patients with HFpEF.2
2. Although hospitalizations for worsening HF are 
often characterized by rapid changes in medical, 
surgical, and device therapy to optimize a patient’s 
clinical status, the patient’s journey with achieving 
optimal HF care continues beyond hospital dis-
charge. Written discharge instructions or educa-
tional material given to the patient, family members, 
or caregiver during the hospital stay or at discharge 
to home should address all of these: activity level, 
diet, discharge medications, follow-up appoint-
ment, weight monitoring, cardiac rehabilitation, and 
what to do if symptoms worsen.14 Thorough dis-
charge planning that includes special emphasis on 
ensuring adherence to an evidence-based medica-
tion regimen is associated with improved patient 
outcomes.15,16 Details of the hospital course and 
the transitional plan of care, with special attention 
to changes in medications and new medical diag-
noses, must be transmitted in a timely and clearly 
understandable form to all of the patient’s clini-
cians who will be delivering follow-up care (Table 
25). Any changes in prognosis that will require 
appropriate care coordination and follow-up post-
discharge should be noted.
3. Systems of care designed to support patients with 
HF as they move through the continuum of care 
can improve outcomes.7 ,14,17 ,18 Real-time feedback 
on performance measure benchmarks can improve 
use of evidence-based therapy and quality of 
care.8 Quality improvement programs designed to 
increase the prescription of appropriate discharge 
medications can increase GDMT prescription at 
discharge and decrease readmissions and mortal-
ity.9 Electronic point-of-care reminders to prescribe 
GDMT in patients with HFrEF can improve use.10,19 
Leveraging transparent health care analytics plat-
forms for benchmarking and performance improve-
ment may be helpful. There are ongoing studies to 
determine the most effective strategies to improve 
evidence-based care.20
4. Early outpatient follow-up, a central element of 
transitional care, varies significantly across US 
hospitals.11 Early postdischarge follow-up may help 
minimize gaps in understanding of changes to the 
care plan or knowledge of test results and has been 
associated with a lower risk of subsequent rehos-
pitalization.11,12 Transition of care interventions 
have often bundled timely clinical follow-up with 
other interventions, making it challenging to iso-
late any unique intervention effects.21 A structured 
contact with the patient within 7 days of hospital Table 25. Important Components of a Transitional Care Plan
A transitional care plan, communicated with the patient and their outpatient 
clinicians before hospital discharge, should clearly outline plans for:
 Addressing any precipitating causes of worsening HF identified in the hos-
pital;
  Adjusting diuretics based on volume status (including weight) and electro-
lytes;
  Coordination of safety laboratory checks (eg, electrolytes after initiation or 
intensification of GDMT);
 Further changes to optimize GDMT, including:
 Plans for resuming medications held in the hospital;
 Plans for initiating new medications;
 Plans for titration of GDMT to goal doses as tolerated;
 Reinforcing HF education and assessing compliance with medical ther-
apy and lifestyle modifications, including dietary restrictions and physical 
activity;
 Addressing high-risk characteristics that may be associated with poor post-
discharge clinical outcomes, such as:
 Comorbid conditions (eg, renal dysfunction, pulmonary disease, diabetes, 
mental health, and substance use disorders);
 Limitations in psychosocial support;
 Impaired health literacy, cognitive impairment;
 Additional surgical or device therapy, referral to cardiac rehabilitation in the 
future, where appropriate;
 Referral to palliative care specialists and/or enrollment in hospice in 
selected patients.

Multimorbidity is common in patients with HF, with >85% 
of patients having ≥2 additional chronic conditions.18,19 Hy-
pertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, anemia, CKD, 
morbid obesity, frailty, and malnutrition are among the most 
common comorbid conditions in patients with HF (Table

ment of HF and have a significant impact on its prognosis. 
How to generate specific recommendations addressing 
many of these conditions in the setting of HF is challeng-
ing given the current state of the evidence. For example, 
although depression is common in patients with HF and

the transferrin saturation is <20%. Intravenous

tients with chronic HF who received weekly intra-
venous ferric carboxymaltose until iron repletion.1 
The improvement was independent of the pres-
ence of anemia. These findings were confirmed 
in 2 more recent trials.2,3 The IRONOUT HF (Iron 
Repletion Effects on Oxygen Uptake in Heart 
Failure) trial, however, showed no such improve-
ment with oral iron supplementation.28 This is 
attributed to the poor absorption of oral iron and 
inadequacy of oral iron to replete the iron stores 
in patients with HF. Therefore, oral iron is not ade-
quate to treat iron deficiency anemia in patients 
with HF. Although these trials were underpowered 
to detect reductions in hard clinical endpoints, 2 
meta-analyses have suggested intravenous iron 
is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular 
death and hospitalizations.27 ,29 Most recently, the 
AFFIRM-AHF multicenter trial, which included 
1132 patients with EF <50% hospitalized for 
HF, showed a decrease in hospitalization for HF 
with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compared 
to placebo (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.94) but no 
reduction in cardiovascular death.4
2. Anemia in patients with HF is associated with 
impaired erythropoietin production, with low lev-
els found to be associated with worse long-term 
outcomes.30,31 Although small studies examining 
the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents for 
the treatment of anemia in patients with HF have 
suggested a trend toward improvement in func-
tional capacity and reduction in hospitalization, 
a high-quality randomized trial of darbepoetin 
alpha in 2278 patients showed no benefit and an 
increase in thrombotic events, including stroke.5,6,32 
A meta-analysis of 13 trials supports these find-
ings.6 Accordingly, erythropoietin-stimulating agent 
therapy is not recommended for the treatment of 
anemia in patients with HF.
Hypertension
3. Clinical trials assessing the impact of goal blood 
pressure reduction on outcomes in patients with 
HFrEF and concomitant hypertension are lacking. 
The optimal blood pressure goal and antihyper-
tensive regimen are not known. Antihypertensive 
therapy is associated with a decrease in the risk 
of incident HF in the general population,33,34 nota-
bly with the more stringent SBP target <120 mm 
Hg.35 However, low blood pressure, not as a part of 
an antihypertensive treatment, has been associated 
with poor outcomes in patients with HFrEF.7, 8 This 
observation may reflect the association between 
low cardiac output and low blood pressure, rather 
than the effects of treatment for hypertension. Nevertheless, hypertension in patients with HFrEF 
represents an opportunity to maximize GDMT to 
goal blood pressures defined by the ACC/AHA 
hypertension guidelines.36
Sleep Disorders
4. In patients with HF, daytime sleepiness—typically 
a feature of obstructive sleep apnea—may not 
reflect the degree of underlying sleep-disordered 
breathing.37 Hence, the decision to refer a patient 
for a sleep study should be based on clinical judg-
ment. Because the treatment of obstructive sleep 
apnea and central sleep apnea differ, and because 
obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea 
can co-occur,9,11,12 sleep studies can inform clinical 
decision-making in patients with HF.
5. In patients with HF and central sleep apnea, con-
tinuous positive airway pressure is associated 
with better sleep quality and nocturnal oxygen-
ation9 but has not been shown to affect sur-
vival.38 In adults with HFrEF and sleep-disordered 
breathing, meta-analyses of RCTs have shown 
that positive airway pressure therapy results in a 
moderate reduction in BNP39 and improvement in 
blood pressure and L VEF.40
6. Adaptive servo-ventilation was associated with 
increased mortality in 2 RCTs involving patients 
with HFrEF and central sleep apnea.11,12 Meta-
analyses have supported these results.41,42 The 
weight of evidence does not support the use 
of adaptive servo-ventilation for central sleep 
apnea in HFrEF.
Diabetes
7 . The American Diabetes Association guidelines 
recommend the use of SGL T2i as first-line agent 
for the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with 
diabetes with HF or at high risk of HF.43 SGL T2i 
are the first class of glucose-lowering agents to 
receive approval from the FDA for the treatment of 
HFrEF. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
with SGL T2i, including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, 
empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin, is associated with 
a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, 
including hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular 
death.44 The mechanisms underlying the improve-
ment in cardiovascular outcomes attributed to 
SGL T2i are, however, unknown but appear to be 
only partially related to the glucosuric effect.45 Two 
RCTs totaling 8474 patients with NYHA class II, 
III, or IV HF and EF ≤40%—DAPA-HF assessing 
dapagliflozin and EMPEROR-Reduced assessing 
empagliflozin—showed significant reductions in the 
relative risk of all-cause death (13%), cardiovascular

1 A1. Patients with chronic HF with permanent-per-
sistent-paroxysmal AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc 
score of ≥2 (for men) and ≥3 (for women)

persistent-paroxysmal AF, DOAC is recom-
mended over warfarin in eligible patients.2–10

AF, AF ablation is reasonable to improve symp-
toms and QOL.11–14
2a B-R4. For patients with AF and LVEF ≤50%, if a 
rhythm control strategy fails or is not desired, 
and ventricular rates remain rapid despite medi-
cal therapy, atrioventricular nodal ablation with 
implantation of a CRT device is reasonable.15–22
2a B-NR5. For patients with chronic HF and permanent-
persistent-paroxysmal AF, chronic anticoagulant 
therapy is reasonable for men and women with-
out additional risk factors.23–26
Synopsis
The interplay between AF and HF is complex. It is clear 
that AF may worsen HF but also that HF increases the 
risk of AF. Data from randomized trials support the use 
of anticoagulation among those with HF and AF but not 
in patients with HF without AF. Anticoagulation may be 
accomplished with DOAC or with warfarin when favored 
because of other indications, cost or drug-drug interac-
tions (the DOAC are generally preferred). The choice 
between rate or rhythm control strategy reflects both 
patient symptoms and the likelihood of better ventricular 
function with sinus rhythm. RCTs of rhythm control with 
antiarrhythmic agents versus rate control have not shown 
a benefit of rhythm control. More recent RCTs with abla-
tion show that ablation may be preferable to antiarrhyth-
mic drugs for a rhythm control strategy. Patients thought 
to have a cardiomyopathy resulting from rapid AF despite 
attempts at rate control should be aggressively treated 
to maintain sinus rhythm and, if that is not successful, atrioventricular nodal ablation with placement of a CRT 
device can be considered. Patients with HF, and difficult 
to control rates, may benefit from atrioventricular node 
ablation and implantation of a permanent pacemaker if 
other rate and rhythm control measures fail. If their L VEF 
is >50%, there is no current evidence that CRT is ben-
eficial compared with RV pacing.15,21
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The efficacy of long-term warfarin for the preven-
tion of stroke in patients with AF is well established; 
randomized trials have shown reduced embolic 
rates and mortality. The AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm 
Society guidelines for AF recommend use of the 
CHA2DS2-VASc score (history of hypertension, 
age ≥75 [doubled weight], diabetes mellitus, previ-
ous stroke or transient ischemic attack or thrombo-
embolism [doubled weight], vascular disease, age 
65 to 74 years, sex category) to assess patient risk 
for adverse outcomes before initiating anticoagu-
lation therapy.1,27 ,28 Regardless of whether patients 
receive rhythm or rate control, anticoagulation is 
recommended for patients with HF and AF for 
stroke prevention with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 
≥2 (for men) and ≥3 (for women).2–5
2. Trials of DOAC have compared the efficacy and 
safety with warfarin therapy rather than placebo. 
Several DOAC are available, including the factor 
Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and 
the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran.2–5 These 
drugs do not need routine anticoagulation monitor-
ing or dose adjustment. The fixed dosing together 
with fewer interactions may simplify patient man-
agement, particularly with the polypharmacy com-
monly seen in HF, but cost for some patients can 
be prohibitive when not covered by insurance. 
These drugs have a potential for an improved ben-
efit–risk profile compared with warfarin, which may 
increase their use in practice, especially in those 
at increased bleeding risk.6–9 In a meta-analysis of 
4 trials examining efficacy and safety of DOAC in 
patients with and without HF, DOAC more effec-
tively reduced the rate of stroke or systemic embo-
lism, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding 
compared with warfarin, with no treatment hetero-
geneity by HF status.10
3. The 2 largest RCTs of AF ablation in HF showed 
a benefit in hospitalizations and mortality with 
ablation.11,12although other smaller trials did 
not. In the AATAC (Ablation Versus Amiodarone 
for Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation in 
Patients with Congestive Heart Failure and an 
Implanted Device) trial, 203 patients with persis-
tent AF, L VEF <40%, and NYHA class II to III HF,

with amiodarone and, in addition, had a 45% 
decrease in hospitalization and decrease in mor-
tality (8% vs. 18%).11 The CASTLE AF (Catheter 
Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation with Heart Failure) 
trial randomized 363 patients with paroxysmal or 
persistent AF, L VEF <35%, NYHA class II to IV 
HF, and ICD to ablation versus standard medi-
cal care.12 The composite endpoint of death or 
rehospitalization was lower in ablation (28.5%) 
compared with standard care (44.6%). In addi-
tion, there was a lower mortality in the ablation 
group. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs comparing 
rhythm versus rate control, patients undergoing 
catheter ablation had improved survival (49% 
relative risk reduction) and reduced hospitaliza-
tions (56% relative risk reduction).13
4. If a rhythm control strategy fails or is undesired, 
and ventricular rates remain rapid despite medi-
cal therapy after all other options are exhausted, 
atrioventricular nodal ablation with implantation of 
a CRT device can be considered as a treatment 
option. Ablate and pace is an old strategy for diffi-
cult to rate control AF. Early studies with RV pacing 
showed benefit.15,16 However, when RV pacing was 
compared with cardiac resynchronization in more 
recent trials, especially in those with reduced L VEFs, 
CRT generally produced more benefit than RV pac-
ing.17–21 The PAVE (Left Ventricular-Based Cardiac 
Stimulation post AV Nodal Ablation Evaluation) 
and the BLOCK-HF (Biventricular versus Right 
Ventricular Pacing in Patients with AV block) trials 
included patients with L VEF >35%, with mean EF 
46%22 in PAVE and 40% in BLOCK-HF (enrolled 
≤50%). In both of these trials, patients undergoing 
CRT had improved outcomes.
5. HF is a hypercoagulable state and serves as 
an independent risk factor for stroke, systemic 
embolism, and mortality in the setting of AF.23,24 
There are compelling data to support the use of 
anticoagulation in most patients with HF and con-
comitant AF, barring contraindications. In patients 
with HF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, those 
with AF had a 3-fold higher risk compared with 
individuals without concomitant AF.25 In a post 
hoc analysis of 2 contemporary HF trials, parox-
ysmal and new onset AF were associated with 
a greater risk for hospitalization caused by HF 
or stroke.26 In a recent registry study, the risk of 
stroke was particularly higher in the initial period 
after diagnosis of HF among patients with preva-
lent AF.29 Because HF is a risk factor, additional 
risk factors may not be required to support the 
use of anticoagulation in patients with HF, and 
the decision to anticoagulate can be individual-
ized according to risk versus benefit.11. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Synopsis
There are important differences in HF incidence, risk 
factors, clinical care needs, and outcomes between spe-
cific patient populations2,3,14,15 (Table 27). It is essential 
that HF clinicians be aware of the biological factors, 
social determinants of health, and implicit biases that 
impact the burden of disease, clinical decision-making, 
and effective delivery of GDMT.9,16–18 Women generally 
present with HF later in life, with more comorbidities and 
lower patient-reported health status than men.10,19 Sur-
vival for women with HF is generally more favorable,20 
although access to specialty care may be lower.21–24 
The highest incident of HF is consistently observed in 
self-identified Black patients.25,26 HF hospitalization and 
mortality rates for Black patients are also higher than 
for White patients, with the gap increasing over time for 
young men.2,4,27 These differences are driven mostly by 
social circumstances; a biological premise or genetic ex-
planation for disease or disease severity should not be 
inferred by race or ethnicity.28 Older patients with HF 
are especially vulnerable to polypharmacy, multimorbid-
ity, cognitive decline, and frailty.29,30 Important strate-
gies to remove biases within health care professionals 
and systems impacting minority and socioeconomically 
disadvantaged patient populations include implicit bias 
training, recruiting a diverse workforce, and promoting 
broad access to HF care.28,31–35

(HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89–0.97), although women are more likely 
not to receive optimal GDMT.20,69–71

neighborhood deprivation index was associated with a 12% in-
crease in risk of HF (adjusted HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.18).46Age-adjusted 1999–2018 HF mortality (deaths/100 000; mean 
and 95% CI) was higher with increasing quartiles of ADI, which is

women in 1999 versus 2017 .27
Gap in outcomes is more pronounced among younger adults (35–

Hispanic Whites, Hispanic patients with HF have shown lower 
short-term mortality rates.81
In GWTG, Hispanic patients with HFpEF had lower mortality (OR, 
0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.81) than non-Hispanic Whites, but this was 
not the case for Hispanic patients with HFrEF (OR, 0.94; 95% CI,

2. Health care system factors are a potential source 
of disparate HF care delivery and outcomes. 
Women are less likely to receive discharge 
instructions for HF,50 less likely to be referred to 
specialty care,21,22 and less likely to receive a heart 
transplantation,51–54 compared with men. Patients 
with HF of Black race have been identified as less 
likely to receive care from a cardiologist during 
an ICU admission for HF,55 have less access to 
specialized inpatient HF care,12 and may be vul-
nerable to clinician biases during evaluation for 
advanced HF therapies.11,53 Hispanic patients 
are disproportionately noninsured in the United 
States,56 may experience language barriers to 
quality care,7, 57 and also have less access to spe-
cialized inpatient HF care.12 Native American and

diovascular complications of cancer therapy, notably 
cardiomyopathy and HF, can result in significant mor-

commonly defined as a decrease in L VEF of at least 
10% to <50%—is necessary to mitigate the cardio-
vascular risks of established novel therapies. Cardio-
oncology is the practice of precancer therapy cardio-
vascular risk stratification, prevention, early detection, 
and treatment of cardiovascular complications.36,37 
The evidence from which guideline recommendations 
in cardio-oncology have emerged has been based on 
studies of anthracycline and trastuzumab-induced car-
diomyopathy. Cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy 
is, however, a heterogeneous disease, with a wide 
range of presentations—from asymptomatic L V dys-
function to cardiogenic shock—and drug-dependent 
pathophysiologic mechanisms that are often poorly 
understood. Until sufficient high-quality, drug-specific 
evidence and cost-effectiveness analyses for screen-
ing and monitoring are available, these recommen-
dations are applicable across potentially cardiotoxic 
therapies (Table 28).

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guidelineoutcomes.1,2,38 Patients who develop HF while 
receiving potentially cardiotoxic therapies 
should have these therapies discontinued while 
a diagnostic workup is undertaken to ascertain 
the cause of HF and initiate GDMT. The com-
plex decision to resume, modify, or permanently 
discontinue therapy by the primary oncologist 
should be done in a patient-centered approach 
in concert with a cardiovascular specialist in 
cardio-oncology. Factors impacting the decision 
include the severity of cancer therapy–related 
cardiomyopathy and the response to neurohor-
monal blockade, the offending agent’s specific 
mechanism of injury, the patient’s comorbid con-
ditions and cancer-related prognosis and, lastly, 
the availability of alternative noncardiotoxic 
treatment options. However, the clinical signifi-
cance of asymptomatic cancer therapy–related 
cardiomyopathy that is identified on routine 
monitoring is less clear. This is most apparent in 
patients receiving trastuzumab in whom asymp-
tomatic decreases in L VEF can occur in >10% of 
patients yet result in a high recovery rate and low 
rate of discontinuation of therapy.1,2 Accordingly, 
trastuzumab is often continued in patients 
deemed low risk while neurohormonal blockade 
is initiated. Conversely, patients diagnosed with 
immune checkpoint-related myocarditis typically 
have the offending agents discontinued indefi-
nitely, given the associated high mortality.39,40
2. Studying the effectiveness of neurohormonal 
therapies specifically in patients with the CTRC  
gene is challenging given the relative infrequency 
of events, heterogeneity of offending agents, 
the poorly understood pathophysiology, and the overlap with comorbid CVD. Available data in 
patients with anthracycline and trastuzumab-
induced cardiomyopathy suggest beta blockers 
and ACEi are effective in improving L V dysfunc-
tion.2–4 Given the dearth of data specific to can-
cer therapy–related cardiomyopathy for other 
GDMT, their use should align with the HFrEF 
management guidelines. Initiation and uptitration 
of standard HF therapies remains the mainstay of 
treatment in patients with cancer therapy–related 
cardiomyopathy or L VEF <50%, with close moni-
toring of cardiac function to guide discussions 
with oncology on the resumption of, or choice of, 
subsequent cancer therapies.2
3. Pretherapy quantification of L VEF in patients 
receiving potentially cardiotoxic cancer thera-
pies serves 4 purposes: 1) pretherapy risk 
stratification and diagnosis of preexisting car-
diomyopathy, 2) establish a reference baseline 
to which reevaluations can be compared, 3) initi-
ate cardioprotective medications before cancer 
therapy, and 4) guide choice of cancer therapy. 
Echocardiography is recommended as the first-
line modality for L VEF assessment given its 
availability, safety, relatively low cost, and its abil-
ity to provide structural and functional informa-
tion beyond L VEF.2,5–16,41–47 The risk of cancer 
therapy–related cardiomyopathy varies greatly 
across cancer therapies and is modified by pre-
existing cardiovascular risk factors (Table 29). 
Pretherapy L VEF is a strong predictor of major 
adverse cardiovascular events in patients receiv-
ing potentially cardiotoxic therapies.2,5–10,42–47 The 
clinical use and cost-effectiveness of systematic 
screening in all patients, however, is unclear.11–16 Table 28. Cancer Therapies Known to Be Associated With Cardiomyopathy

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure GuidelinePatients with cancer and preexisting cardio-
vascular risk factors are at significantly higher 
risk of cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy, 
representing a population in which pretherapy 
evaluation would have a significantly higher 
yield.2,5–10,42–47
4. The purpose of serial monitoring of L VEF in 
patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic anti-
cancer agents is to identify subclinical cardiac 
injury, initiate cardioprotective agents, and con-
sider temporary or permanent interruption of 
the offending agent.2,4,6,8,48 The practice of L VEF 
monitoring has mostly been implemented in 
patients receiving anthracyclines, trastuzumab, 
or both (Table 28). In a study of 2625 patients 
receiving anthracyclines for breast cancer or 
lymphoma who underwent serial L VEF moni-
toring, cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy 
occurred in 9% of patients, of whom 81% had 
mild symptoms (NYHA class I to II).4 Beta block-
ers and ACEi-ARB were initiated in all patients, 
with 86% having at least partial recovery of 
LV E F.4 Patients with recovered L VEF had a lower 
incidence of cardiac events than those that 
did not.4 The clinical significance of an asymp-
tomatic decrease in L VEF and the optimal fre-
quency and duration of monitoring is less clear 
and likely depend on patient risk, the anticancer 
agent used, and its cumulative dose. Although 
a one-size-fits-all approach to monitoring for 
cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy may be 
easier to implement systematically, it may not be 
the most cost-effective. Until additional data are 
available, limiting the monitoring to patients at 
higher risk of cancer therapy–related cardiomy-
opathy (Table 29) is a reasonable strategy.
5. Whether the preemptive use of ACEi-ARB, spi-
ronolactone, or selected beta blockers such as 
carvedilol and nebivolol is effective in reducing the 
risk of cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy has been investigated in a number of small 
clinic trials, with conflicting findings.17–27 ,49 The 
most supportive of this practice is a study that 
randomized 114 patients receiving high-dose 
chemotherapy and having a posttreatment tropo-
nin rise >0.07 ng/mL to enalapril or placebo.20 
None of the patients in the enalapril arm met the 
primary endpoint (>10% decrease in L VEF to 
below 50%), while 43% of patients in the stan-
dard of care group had a significant decrease 
in L VEF.20 Although other studies have shown 
similar findings, the magnitude of the difference 
in L VEF between arms was often small (<5%) 
and of questionable clinical significance.19,22 Not 
all studies have replicated these findings.18,21,24,26 
Most importantly, none of the studies have 
assessed whether preemptive use of HF thera-
pies in patients at risk for cancer therapy–related 
cardiomyopathy improves clinical outcomes, such 
as mortality or hospitalization for HF. Additional 
studies are needed to define the appropriate cri-
teria and patient population in whom to initiate 
medical therapies for the primary prevention of 
cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy.
6. Cardiovascular biomarkers, notably troponin, have 
been studied for cardiovascular risk stratifica-
tion in patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic 
therapies.29–32 A study of 452 patients with breast 
cancer showed that an elevated pretreatment 
level (>14 ng/L) was associated with a 4-fold 
increase in the risk of cancer therapy–related car-
diomyopathy.32 Other smaller studies have found 
no advantage in measuring troponin or natriuretic 
peptides pretherapy.50–53 Overall, these biomarker 
studies were observational and small in sample 
size and number of events.54 Serial biomarkers 
may be more useful in risk stratification. For exam-
ple, in a study of 703 patients receiving anthra-
cyclines, an increase in troponin within 72 hours 
of chemotherapy and 1 month after the comple-
tion of treatment course were associated with a 
greater risk of cancer therapy–related cardiomy-
opathy.29 The clinical use of measuring biomark-
ers was assessed in 1 trial in which 114 patients 
with posttreatment increase in troponin to >0.07 
ng/mL were randomized to enalapril or standard 
of care.20 None of the patients in the enalapril 
group had a decrease in L VEF, compared with 
43% in the standard of care group.20 Data for the 
use of natriuretic peptides are limited. In practice, 
biomarkers could provide rapid risk stratification 
in patients for which echocardiographic findings 
are equivocal and help determine whether symp-
toms are cardiovascular in origin.Table 29. Risk Factors for Cancer Therapy–Related

1 C-LD1. In women with a history of HF or cardiomyopathy, 
including previous peripartum cardiomyopathy, 
patient-centered counseling regarding contra-
ception and the risks of cardiovascular deteriora-
tion during pregnancy should be provided.1–8
2b C-LD2. In women with acute HF caused by peripartum 
cardiomyopathy and LVEF <30%, anticoagula-
tion may be reasonable at diagnosis, until 6 to 
8 weeks postpartum, although the efficacy and 
safety are uncertain.9–12
3: Harm C-LD3. In women with HF or cardiomyopathy who are 
pregnant or currently planning for pregnancy, 
ACEi, ARB, ARNi, MRA, SGLT2i, ivabradine, 
and vericiguat should not be administered 
because of significant risks of fetal harm.13–15
Synopsis
HF may complicate pregnancy either secondary to an ex-
isting prepregnancy cardiomyopathy, or as a result of peri-
partum cardiomyopathy.16–18 Peripartum cardiomyopathy is 
defined as systolic dysfunction, typically L VEF <45%, often 
with L V dilation, occurring in late pregnancy or early postpar-
tum with no other identifiable cardiomyopathy cause.14,19–21 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs globally,22,23 with the 
highest incidences in Nigeria, Haiti, and South Africa. Inci-
dence in the United States is 1 in 1000 to 8000 deliver-
ies and has risen over time.24,25 Peripartum cardiomyopathy 
risk factors include maternal age >30 years, African an-
cestry, multiparity, multigestation, preeclampsia/eclampsia, 
anemia, diabetes, obesity, and prolonged tocolysis.22,23,26–30 
A genetic contribution is recognized,31–33 particularly titan 
gene mutations.34,35 Most women present with HF within 
1 month postpartum; cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or 
venous-arterial thromboembolism are all possible. Treat-
ment includes GDMT adjusted for pregnancy or breast-
feeding status and anticoagulation consideration16; iden-
tification of a pathogenic 16-kDa prolactin led to trials of 
the dopamine-agonist bromocriptine.36–41 Patient-centered 
multidisciplinary planning is essential, including early insti-
tution of mechanical support for shock42 (Table 30). Prog-
nosis is related to initial L VEF, L V thrombosis, RV involve-
ment, preeclampsia, geographic region, and race.7 ,43–48 LV  
recovery and survival is generally favorable in developed 
countries11,25,49; a 100-patient US registry showed 93% 
transplant/L VAD-free 1-year survival.46
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Pregnancy is generally well-tolerated in women with 
cardiomyopathy and NYHA class I prepregnancy. 
However, clinical deterioration can occur, so pre-
pregnancy counseling and shared decision-making are essential.1,3,50 Among women with non–peri-
partum cardiomyopathy, major cardiovascular 
events occurred in 39% (United States) and 35% 
(Canada) of pregnancies, with 1% and 7% mortal-
ity, respectively.51,52 Previous cardiac events, NYHA 
class III to IV, or L VEF <40% markedly increased 
maternal and fetal risks.51–55 The ROPAC (Registry 
of Pregnancy and Cardiac disease) study describes 
pregnancy outcomes for 1321 women with struc-
tural heart disease: Women with prepregnancy or 
peripartum cardiomyopathy had the highest mortal-
ity rate (2.4%).2,22 ROPAC was used to validate the 
modified WHO risk classification56; the ZAHARA I 
(Zwangerschap bij Aangeboren Hartafwijkingen I) 
and CARPREG II (CARdiac disease in PREGnancy) 
scores also support shared decision-making.51,57 ,58 
Subsequent pregnancies for women with previous 
peripartum cardiomyopathy have been associated 
with further decreases in L V function, maternal 
death, and adverse fetal outcomes.43,58 The stron-
gest prognostic determinant is L VEF <50% before 
a subsequent pregnancy.6–8 An international sys-
tematic review that included 93 subsequent preg-
nancies with persistent L V dysfunction reported 
48% further L VEF deterioration, 49% HF symp-
toms, and 16% mortality, whereas among 98 with 
recovered L V function presubsequent pregnancy, 
these rates were 27%, 32%, and 0%, respectively.5
2. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state even in the 
absence of cardiovascular complications. In the set-
ting of acute HF, particularly when there is L V blood 
stasis because of severely reduced systolic function, 
the risk of intracardiac thrombus formation is sig-
nificant. The incidence of intracardiac thrombi dur-
ing acute HF caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy 
has been reported to be around 16% to 17%.9,10 
with 9% thromboembolic events in 2 separate 
cohorts11,12 Women with an intracardiac thrombus 
or a thromboembolic event receive anticoagula-
tion as per standard of care. Women with severely 
depressed L VEF (<30%) in the setting of acute 
HF caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy can be 
considered for anticoagulation, especially in the first 
6 to 8 weeks postpartum, when hypercoagulabil-
ity is most pronounced. If bromocriptine is used for 
postpartum women with severe acute HF caused 
by peripartum cardiomyopathy and L VEF <35%, it 
should be accompanied by at least prophylactic-
dosed anticoagulation, because of the potential 
association with thromboembolic events.6 However, 
the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine for acute 
peripartum cardiomyopathy treatment currently 
remains uncertain, and further randomized placebo-
controlled trials are required to define the role of this 
therapy, particularly in the setting of contemporary 
HF GDMT and cardiogenic shock management.

*An initial open-label pilot RCT in South Africa suggested addition of bromocriptine to GDMT was associated with greater LVEF improvement and a lower rate of the composite 
endpoint at 6 mo.37 Among 96 women with acute PPCM in a Burkina Faso RCT, 4 wk of bromocriptine was associated with LVEF recovery and lower mortality (16.6% versus 
29.1%; P<0.001).39 A multicenter German study randomized 63 patients to 1 versus 8 wk of bromocriptine (no placebo, as deemed unethical),38 with LVEF recovery ≥50% in 
52% and 68% of the 1- and 8-wk groups, respectively, and no deaths. A substudy also showed high rates of RV recovery.41 Two retrospective cohorts (Germany, Canada) and a 
multicenter cohort of subsequent pregnancies also suggested greater LVEF recovery with bromocriptine.31,38,40 Bromocriptine may currently be most justified in women with LVEF 
<25% or cardiogenic shock. The downsides of prohibiting breastfeeding should be considered. Bromocriptine should be accompanied by at least prophylactic-dosed anticoagula-

ACEi and ARB are associated with second- and third-

Synopsis
The ACC/AHA Task Force on Performance Measures 
(Task Force) distinguishes quality measures from perfor-
mance measures. Performance measures are selected 
from the most important ACC/AHA clinical practice 
guideline recommendations with the strongest evidence. 
These measures are suitable for public reporting or pay 
for performance. Quality measures are those metrics that 
may be useful for local quality improvement but do not reach the performance measure standard. Performance 
measures of the ACC/AHA focus on process of care 
measures that measure the quality of care by the clini-
cian, facility, and health system. Patient registries that 
track such measures can provide feedback to partici-
pants, which may help with improvement in quality.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. The current ACC/AHA performance and qual-
ity measures (based on the 2013 ACC/AHA HF 
guideline and the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline 
supplement) are displayed in Table 31.8 The perfor-
mance measures are derived from the most defini-
tive guideline recommendations (ie, NYHA class I 
and class III recommendations). Observational data 
suggest that hospitals that receive feedback on 
their HF care improve over time.1–7
2. Hospitals that perform well on medication-related 
performance measures have better HF mortality 
rates than hospitals with poorer performance.3,4 Other 
observational data suggest that hospitals that par-
ticipate in registries have better process of care and 
outcomes compared with hospitals that do not partic-
ipate.5,6 Randomized studies of audit and feedback of 
performance, in many different patient groups, have, 
in general, showed improvement in care.7 However, 
public reporting of HF measures in Ontario, Canada, 
did not clearly improve care during a randomized trial.9

1 C-LD1. For all patients with HF, palliative and supportive 
care—including high-quality communication, 
conveyance of prognosis, clarifying goals of 
care, shared decision-making, symptom man-
agement, and caregiver support—should be 
provided to improve QOL and relieve suffering.1
1 C-LD2. For patients with HF being considered for, or 
treated with, life-extending therapies, the option 
for discontinuation should be anticipated and dis-
cussed through the continuum of care, including at 
the time of initiation, and reassessed with changing 
medical conditions and shifting goals of care.2,3

HF patients being evaluated for advanced 
therapies, patients requiring inotropic support 
or temporary mechanical support, patients 
experiencing uncontrolled symptoms, major 
medical decisions, or multimorbidity, frailty, and 
cognitive impairment—specialist palliative care

sion of family caregivers in patient care and attention 
to their needs during bereavement.10 Other support-
ive needs include home and case management assis-
tance, transportation, and care coordination.11 Pallia-
tive and supportive care has a role across the stages 
of HF, starting early in the course of illness, intensify-
ing in end-stage disease, and extending into caregiver 
bereavement (Figure 15).12 Many palliative care needs 
can and should be addressed by the patient’s interdis-
ciplinary care team (primary palliative care), including 
clarifying their core values, health outcome goals, and 
therapeutic preferences.1 Specialty palliative care cli-
nicians (secondary palliative care) may be consulted 
to collaboratively care for patients and their families 
with more challenging needs.7 Barriers to the receipt 
of palliative care include reluctance of health care pro-
fessionals to address death and dying and a propen-
sity for patients and caregivers to equate palliation and 
hospice as hastening death.15Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Palliative and supportive approaches to the care of 
patients with HF is inherent to their overall care and 
should be incorporated throughout the course of ill-
ness by all health care professionals.9 The applica-
tion of the principles embraced have been shown 
to improve various processes of care and patient 
outcomes (Table 32). Palliative and supportive care 
discussions do not imply that a formal palliative care 
consultation is needed for each patient but that 
team members should integrate palliative and sup-
portive considerations into routine care.
2. As overall illness progresses, major decisions are 
increasingly made regarding the initiation, con-
tinued use, and discontinuation of potentially 
life-sustaining therapies, including intravenous ino-
tropes, ICDs, MCS, and renal replacement therapy. 
Dependence on, and deactivation of, potentially 
life-sustaining therapies should be anticipated and

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESHeidenreich et al 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guidelinediscussed at the time of initiation and reconsidered 
serially with changing medical realities and evolv-
ing goals of care.12 Patients have a right to decline 
or withdraw care at any time, consistent with the 
principle of respect for autonomy.19 Failure to pro-
actively address topics such as deactivation of ICD 
and L VAD therapies can lead to suffering at the 
end of life.2,3
3. Although a range of clinicians caring for patients 
with HF are able to manage many palliative care 
needs, formal palliative care consultation may 
be particularly helpful for patients with these: 1) 
refractory symptoms; 2) major medical decisions 
(eg, in the United States, inclusion of a palliative 
care specialist on the team is mandatory for pay-
ment from Medicare for L VAD implantation); and 3) 
multimorbidity, frailty, or cognitive impairment (mul-
tiple validated frailty and cognitive measures are 
available). A growing body of evidence supports 
the inclusion of specialty palliative care into the 
management of patients diagnosed with a range 
of advanced diseases,20 including HF. An interdis-
ciplinary palliative care intervention in patients with 
advanced HF showed greater benefits in QOL, 
anxiety, depression, and spiritual well-being com-
pared with usual care alone (PAL-HF [Palliative 
Care in Heart Failure]).4 However, other trials have 
been mixed,5,6 and many negative,21–23 such that 
formal palliative care interventions should be tai-
lored to patient and caregiver wants and needs.4. Advance care planning is a process that sup-
ports understanding and sharing of patients’ per-
sonal values, life goals, and preferences regarding 
future medical care. Key domains include discuss-
ing patients’ values, documenting plans for medi-
cal treatments, designating a surrogate decision 
maker, and revisiting this process over time.24 
Familiarity with local and state laws is needed relat-
ing to advance care planning, decisions regarding 
life-sustaining treatments, and evolving treatments 
with legal ramifications, especially when caring for 
vulnerable populations.19 Few patients with HF 
have formally defined their care goals and desig-
nated a surrogate decision maker.25
5. Hospice is a specific model of subspecialty pallia-
tive care that is offered to patients with a terminal 
disease who are at the end of life when curative 
or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus 
of treatment.10 Historically, hospice use has been 
low among patients dying with HF and, among 
those engaging in hospice, the duration of time in 
hospice was short, suggesting late referral. Low 
hospice referral rates and high-intensity care at 
end of life often reflects health care professional 
biases and limitations in models of care rather than 
patient values.26 This appears to be changing in 
the United States, where CDC data from 2003 to 
2017 on US site of death show that the proportion 
of cardiovascular deaths related to HF occurring 
in hospice facilities rose from 0.2% to 8.2% and 
deaths at home rose from 20.6% to 30.7%.27Table 32. Palliative and Supportive Care Domains to Improve Processes of Care and Patient Outcomes
Palliative and Supportive  
Domains of Care What Palliative Care Adds to Overall HF Management
High-quality communication Central to palliative care approaches are communication and patient-caregiver engagement techniques.16
Conveyance of prognosis Palliative care specifically addresses patient and caregiver understanding of disease, treatment, and prognosis. Research 
suggests that patients tend to overestimate their survival17 and overestimate the potential benefits of treatment.18 Objective 
risk models can calibrate expectations, but discussion of uncertainty should accompany prognostic conversations, often sum-
marized as “hope for the best, plan for the worst. ”
Clarifying goals of care Management of patients with HF as their disease becomes end-stage and death seems near includes decisions about 
when to discontinue treatments designed primarily to prolong life (eg, ICD, hospitalization, tube feeding), decisions on 
when to initiate treatments to reduce pain and suffering that may hasten death (eg, narcotics), and decisions about the 
location of death, home services, and hospice care. Exploring patients’ expressed preferences, values, needs, concerns, 
means and desires through clinician-led discussion can clarify values-treatment concordance and improve medical deci-
sion-making.12
Shared decision-making Shared decision-making is a process by which patients and clinicians work together to make optimal health care 
decisions from medically reasonable options that align with what matters most to patients. Shared decision-making re-
quires: unbiased medical evidence about the risks, benefits, and burdens of each alternative, including no intervention; 
clinician expertise in communication and tailoring that evidence for individual patients; and patient goals and informed 
preferences.12
Symptom management Dyspnea, fatigue, pain, nausea, depression, anxiety, and other symptoms of HF refractory to cardiovascular therapies can be 
partially remediated through palliative and supportive approaches in addition to GDMT.5
Caregiver support Care of the patient with heart failure should extend to their loved ones, including beyond their death, to offer support to fami-
lies and help them cope with loss.
GDMT indicates guideline-directed medical therapy; HF, heart failure; and ICD, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

DIRECTIONS
14.1. Patient-Reported Outcomes
Recommendation for Patient-Reported Outcomes
COR LOE Recommendation
2a C-LD1. In patients with HF, standardized assessment 
of patient-reported health status using a vali-
dated questionnaire can be useful to provide 
incremental information for patient functional 
status, symptom burden, and prognosis.1–19
Synopsis
Health status encapsulates symptoms, functional status, 
and health-related QOL. Understanding health status is 
important for treatment decisions and counseling. Clini-
cians traditionally evaluate health status based on the 
clinical interview and exam, summarizing it as the NYHA 
functional classification. Additionally, patient-reported 
health status can be ascertained using standardized 
questionnaires, such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire or the Minnesota Living with Heart Fail-
ure Questionnaire. Previous studies found discordance 
between patient-reported health status and clinician as-
sessment using NYHA classification.20,21 Patient-reported 
health status may have higher reliability and better sensi-
tivity for clinical changes than NYHA classification and is 
moderately correlated with CPET and the 6-minute walk 
test.1–8 Patient-reported health status is an independent 
predictor of hospitalization and mortality.9–19 There are 
minimal data regarding the effect of incorporating patient-
reported health status assessment into routine care. How-
ever, these assessments provide valuable incremental 
information beyond the standard evaluation. Increasing 
the patient’s voice in clinical assessment and decision-
making is important in its own right. Additionally, there is 
substantial variation in risk-adjusted health status across 
practices.22 Future efforts should focus on expanding the 
use of patient-reported health status in routine care while 
researching its implementation and impact.
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Standardized patient-reported health status ques-
tionnaires provide reliable measures of health 
status correlated to other functional status mea-
sures1–8 and independently associated with 
clinical outcomes.9–19 HF-specific health status 
assessments (eg, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire, Minnesota Living with Heart 
Failure Questionnaire, PROMIS-Plus-HF [Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System-Plus-Heart Failure]) are preferable 
because they are more sensitive to changes in disease status and more responsive to HF therapy 
than generic health status measures.1 Although 
select clinics have successfully implemented 
patient-reported health status in clinical practice,23 
there are minimal data regarding the impact of such 
efforts. However, there are potential advantages to 
routine assessment. First, better understanding of 
symptom burden and prognosis may improve the 
quality of treatment decisions and, subsequently, 
QOL. Health status can be improved via guide-
line-recommended therapies.24–31 Although some 
therapies are recommended for mortality benefit, 
symptom assessment can identify patients need-
ing additional interventions (eg, diuretic escala-
tion). Second, routine assessment can facilitate 
population health management by identifying high-
risk patients needing closer monitoring or refer-
ral to specialized centers. Third, patient-reported 
health status assessment increases the patient’s 
role, which can motivate initiation and uptitration 
of medical therapy. However, routine assessment 
of patient-reported status increases the burden 
of data collection for patients and health systems 
and underscores the need for future studies evalu-
ating the impact of assessment.
14.2. Evidence Gaps and Future Research 
Directions
Significant gaps exist despite evolving evidence and 
treatment strategies in patients with HF. Table 33 pro-
vides selected, common issues that should be addressed 
in future clinical research.

This table represents the relationships of committee members with industry and other entities that were determined to be relevant to this document. These relation-
ships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and/or conference calls of the writing committee during the document development process. The 
table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant interest in a business if the interest 
represents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$5000 of the fair market value of the business entity; or if funds 
received by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are 
also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted. According to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant 
relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject matter, intellectual property or asset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or 
b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a drug, drug class, or device addressed in the document or makes a competing drug or device ad-
dressed in the document; or c) the person or a member of the person’s household, has a reasonable potential for financial, professional or other personal gain or loss 
as a result of the issues/content addressed in the document. Writing committee members are required to recuse themselves from voting on sections to which their 
specific relationships with industry and other entities may apply.
*Significant relationship.
†No financial benefit.
‡This disclosure was entered under the Clinical Trial Enroller category in the ACC’s disclosure system. To appear in this category, the author acknowledges that 
there is no direct or institutional relationship with the trial sponsor as defined in the (ACCF or AHA/ACC) Disclosure Policy for Writing Committees.
§Lorraine Nnacheta is an AHA/ACC joint staff member and acts as the guideline advisor for the “2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart 
Failure. ” No relevant relationships to report. Non-voting author on recommendations and not included/counted in the RWI balance for this committee.

Appendix 3. Appendix for Tables 3 and 4: Suggested Thresholds for Structural Heart Disease and Evidence of Increased  
Filling Pressures
Morphology •  LAVI ≥29 mL/m2
•  LVMI >116/95 g/m2
•  RWT >0.42
•  LV wall thickness ≥12 mm
Ventricular systolic function •  LVEF <50%
•  GLS <16%
Ventricular diastolic function •  Average E/eʹ ≥15 for increased filling pressures
•  Septal eʹ <7 cm/s
•  Lateral eʹ <10 cm/s
•  TR velocity >2.8 m/s
•  Estimated PA systolic pressure >35 mm Hg
Biomarker •  BNP ≥35 pg/mL*
•  NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/mL*
AF indicates atrial fibrillation; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; CKD, chronic kidney disease; GLS, global longitudinal strain; HF, heart failure; LAVI, left atrial volume 
index; LV, left ventricular; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; LVMI, left ventricular mass index; NT-proBNP, natriuretic peptide tests; PA, pulmonary artery; RWT, 
relative wall thickness; and TR, tricuspid regurgitation.
*Cutoffs provided for natriuretic peptide levels may have lower specificity, especially in older patients or in patients with AF or CKD. Usually, higher cutoff values 
are recommended for the diagnosis of HF in these patients. Natriuretic peptide cutoffs selected for population screening for pre-HF (stage B HF) may be <99% 
reference limits and need to be defined according to the population at risk.
