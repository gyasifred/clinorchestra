Introduction
Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) is estimated to contribute 
to approximately 45% of all child deaths globally.1 Approximately 
20 million children less than 5 years of age worldwide are severely undernourished, leaving them extremely vulnerable to illness and premature death. Many older children in developing countries enter adolescence undernourished, which increases their vulnerability to disease and premature death.
2 Poverty, fam-
ine, and war are primary contributors to global malnutrition and limit food distribution and access, even when food is available for consumption. Development of acute or chronic infectious and/or diarrheal disease in those who are already undernourished contributes to the high mortality rates associated with pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) in developing nations.

Pediatric undernutrition has historically been considered an 
issue exclusive to developing countries. Much of the ground-breaking research and initial development of malnutrition (under -
nutrition) criteria occurred with populations outside of the United 557642 NCP XXX10.1177/0884533614557642Nutrition in Clinical PracticeBecker et al

Abstract
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.), 
utilizing an evidence-informed, consensus-derived process, recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic indicators be used to identify and document pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) in routine clinical practice. The recommended indicators include z  scores 
for weight-for-height/length, body mass index-for-age, or length/height-for-age or mid–upper arm circumference when a single data point is available. When 2 or more data points are available, indicators may also include weight gain velocity (<2 years of age), weight loss (2–20 years of age), deceleration in weight for length/height z score, and inadequate nutrient intake. The purpose of this consensus 
statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document undernutrition in the pediatric population ages 1 month to 18 years. The indicators are intended for use in multiple settings (eg, acute, ambulatory care/outpatient, residential care). Several screening tools have been developed for use in hospitalized children. However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper. Clinicians should use as many data points as available to identify and document the presence of malnutrition. The universal use of a single set of diagnostic parameters will expedite the recognition of pediatric undernutrition, lead to the development of more accurate estimates of its prevalence and incidence, direct interventions, and promote improved outcomes. A standardized diagnostic approach will also inform the prediction of the human and financial responsibilities and costs associated with the prevention and treatment of undernutrition in this vulnerable population and help to further ensure the provision of high-quality, cost-effective nutritional care.

States4 where acute or chronic infections and/or diarrheal disease 
are major contributors to its development and to high rates of 
mortality. However, the clinical perspective and description of undernutrition has evolved during the past 3 decades. Unlike the undernutrition typically observed in developing countries, and usually categorized as marasmus and/or kwashiorkor, undernutri-tion in developed countries generally occurs in the setting of acute or chronic illness.
3
A number of U.S. children suffer from energy imbalance 
and excess rather than nutrient deficiency. It is estimated that approximately 17% of U.S. children and adolescents between 2 and 19 years of age are obese.
5 Other data sets estimate that 
1 in 10 U.S. households with children struggle with food inse-curity.
6 The current prevalence of U.S. children who experi-
ence acute or chronic undernutrition is unknown. Children and adolescents who live in homeless shelters, are victims of abuse or neglect, or live in urban or rural areas where access to high-quality food is difficult are thought to be at increased risk for undernutrition.
Undernutrition in the United States is most frequently 
observed in hospitalized acute and/or chronically ill children and in U.S. children with special healthcare needs.
3,7 Children with 
special needs are defined as “those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emo-tional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that of children generally.”
7 This 
definition encompasses children with nutrition-related chronic diseases or conditions, congenital anomalies, and severe acute illness or injury and those affected by abuse or neglect.
Children and youth with special healthcare needs should be 
routinely screened for malnutrition in primary care settings. Registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), nurses, and all mem-bers of the healthcare team should collaborate to ensure that screening for malnutrition becomes an integral part of routine pediatric care. Although research is limited, malnutrition in this population can lead to more complicated hospitalizations due to progression of the underlying disease or condition, poor wound healing, or slow return to previous level of activity, complications that can significantly increase the length of stay and cost of hospitalization.
8,9 Comprehensive assessment and 
nutritional intervention in undernourished and malnourished children in primary care settings can reduce the need for more costly hospitalization by addressing nutritional deficits that may predispose the patient to acute illness or exacerbate the underlying disease or condition.
10 Older studies suggest that up 
to 25% of all hospitalized children experienced acute protein-energy malnutrition and approximately 27% of children in the community experience chronic food insecurity.
6,11
Inadequate intake, self-starvation, and/or purging behaviors 
associated with disordered eating/eating disorders can lead to malnutrition.
12 These behaviors are most common among teen-
age girls. It is estimated that 0.5% of adolescents suffer with anorexia nervosa, with another 1%–2% meeting a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. However, it is estimated that up to 14% of adolescents have “partial syndromes or eating disorder not oth-erwise specified” and already have signs and symptoms of malnutrition.
13 Adolescents often try to hide aberrant eating 
behaviors. Laboratory parameters often remain normal for a period of time after aberrant eating behaviors have begun. Thus, the adolescent may already be in an undernourished state before presenting to a healthcare provider.
14 In fact, the RDN 
may be the first provider to recognize the symptoms or the first provider contacted by the patient or caregivers.
15
Purpose
The purpose of this consensus statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document under -
nutrition in the pediatric population ages 1 month to 18 years. Several screening tools have been developed for use in hospital-ized children.
16 The indicators are intended for use in multiple 
settings (eg, acute, ambulatory care/outpatient, residential care).However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper. The diagnosis and documen-tation of undernutrition in neonates, the recognition and docu-mentation of micronutrient deficits in the pediatric population, and strategies to address micronutrient deficits are beyond the scope of this statement. Please refer to publications/resources specific to these topics for further guidance.
17–20 The diagnosis 
and treatment of pediatric obesity (overnutrition) are also not addressed in this statement.
Definition of Pediatric Malnutrition 
(Undernutrition)
The focus of this consensus statement is pediatric undernutri-
tion. A.S.P.E.N. has defined pediatric malnutrition (undernutri-tion) as “an imbalance between nutrient requirement and intake, resulting in cumulative deficits of energy, protein or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development and other relevant outcomes.”
21 Pediatric undernutrition may 
be related to illness, adverse environmental or behavioral fac-tors, injury, congenital anomalies, and so on. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) states that although mal-nutrition is a broad term, commonly used as an alternative to undernutrition, it technically also encompasses overnutrition.
22 
People are considered to be malnourished (undernourished) if their diet does not provide adequate energy and protein for growth and development or if they are unable to fully utilize the food/nutrients due to illness. Children are also classified as malnourished (overnourished) if they consume too much energy. Although obesity is a form of malnutrition, a discus-sion of overnutrition is not the purpose of this article.
Acute vs Chronic Undernutrition
Undernutrition is often characterized as acute or chronic. One way to distinguish between “acute” and “chronic” is time. Acute

diseases or conditions are typically severe and sudden in onset. A 
chronic disease or condition tends to develop and become more severe over an extended period of time. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) defines “chronic” as a disease or condi-tion that has lasted for 3 months or longer.
23A chronic condition 
may contribute to an acute illness, just as an acute illness may evolve into a chronic condition if unaddressed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have 
also provided guidance to distinguish between acute and chronic undernutrition by offering diagnostic parameters that help clini-cians characterize the acuity level of undernutrition experienced by pediatric populations. Weight is primarily affected during periods of acute undernutrition, whereas chronic undernutrition typically manifests as stunting. Severe acute undernutrition, experienced by children ages 6–60 months of age, is defined as a very low weight-for-height (less than −3 standard deviations [SD] [z  scores] of the median WHO growth standards), by visible 
severe wasting (mid–upper arm circumference [MUAC] ≤115 
mm), or by the presence of nutritional edema. Wasting is defined as a weight-for-age less than −2 SD (z  score).
24,25 Chronic under -
nutrition or stunting is defined by WHO as having a height-for-age (or length-for-age) that is less than −2 SD (z  score) of the 
median of the NCHS/WHO international reference.
24,25 An in-
depth discussion of the z  score is presented later in this paper.
Stunting is a well-established indicator of chronic malnutri-
tion, particularly undernutrition related to environmental or socioeconomic circumstances.
24,25 The height-for-age mea-
surement represents the linear growth or stature actually achieved by the child at the age at which the child is measured. Height (ie, stature) is measured in the standing position. Length-for-age refers to measurements taken in the recumbent position and is recommended for children ≤2 years of age.
26 
Children in the age range of 0–4 years have the best potential outcomes from comprehensive assessment for malnutrition because timely intervention is highly likely to prevent adverse effects.
26 Stunting may be observed during adolescence, which 
is also a period of rapid growth and development.Table 1 lists examples of software programs such as 
ANTHRO that are available for individual z score calcula-tion.
27 Also, many growth charts (Fenton, WHO, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) are available  
on mobile technology applications and have made plotting very easy.
Indicators of Pediatric Undernutrition
A standardized approach to the recognition and diagnosis of pediatric undernutrition, particularly in the pediatric popula-tion older than 60 months, is lacking. Controversy surrounding the best and most useful approach(es) abounds. Therefore rou-tine assessment of nutritional status in high-risk children in the United States is sporadic and inconsistent among facilities. A true measure of the impact of pediatric undernutrition on over -
all health is difficult to obtain. The National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs
7 does not currently include 
assessment of food/nutrition services provided; this data defi-cit must be addressed and the survey instrument revised to accommodate the collection of such data.
Attributes of Indicators Selected for 
Inclusion
A multitude of parameters have been developed for obtaining 
measurements in children in an effort to determine nutritional status. However, the increasing economic constraints of the U.S. healthcare system mandate identification of the most reli-able, reproducible, safe/low-risk, and cost-effective indicators to support nutritional evaluation. Thus, attributes of the indica-tors that we recommend are as follows:
• •are evidence informed and consensus derived,
• •are universally available and validated,
• •can be applied inexpensively in multiple settings,
• •can be properly used with minimal training,Table 1.  Resources for Determining z  Scores for Anthropometrics.

• •can reproducibly identify undernutrition,
• •can quantify the severity of undernutrition,
• •can be used to monitor changes in nutritional status.
Indicators recommended to identify pediatric malnutrition are 
typically continuous rather than discrete variables. As such, clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exer -
cised when obtaining a history, completing the physical exam, developing differential diagnostic options, making a diagnosis, and implementing and monitoring a plan of care. Remember that the recommended list of indicators to be assessed may change over time as evidence to support or to discontinue their use accrues or as advances in assessment technology supplant their use.
Consensus Recommendations
We recommend that the following list of indicators be used when assessing and diagnosing pediatric malnutrition.
Food/Nutrient Intake
Food and nutrient intake are the primary determinants of nutri-tional status. Therefore, accurate assessment of intake and esti-mation of adequacy is critical. The primary concern is whether or not the child’s current intake is adequate to meet their nutri-ent needs in the context of his or her current clinical situation, growth pattern, and developmental level.
21 Other diagnostic 
indicators are basically “outcome measures” of dietary adequacy.
Estimates of the adequacy of protein/energy intake should 
be routinely determined for all children, especially for those identified at increased risk for malnutrition. Accuracy in the estimation of the adequacy of nutrient needs and assessment of the adequacy of food and nutrient intake are crucial to deter -
mining the magnitude of the deficit, as well as the extent and acuity of the deficit. Food/nutrient intake details can be obtained by history and/or by direct observation of food and/or nutrients consumed. Prescribed nutrition therapy intake should be monitored to ensure that the intended amounts are actually ingested by the child.
Assessment of Energy and Protein Needs
Energy needs can be measured by indirect calorimetry28,29 or 
estimated through the use of standard equations.30 Each of the 
methods to estimate energy needs is just that: an estimation. Ideally, clinicians should perform indirect calorimetry to mea-sure a child’s actual energy requirements. Indirect calorimetry is the most precise method for the determination of energy expenditure because predictive equations do not accurately determine energy expenditure or account for the variability of a child’s metabolic state during the course of an illness.
28,29 The 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO31 and Schofield32 equations, although imprecise and developed to 
estimate the energy utilization of healthy children, are the most widely used formulas to estimate energy needs. These equa-tions are frequently used when equipment for indirect calorim-etry assessment is unavailable. The estimation of energy requirements can also be determined using the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
33 or the 2005 
Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) estimated energy require-ments.
19 However, both of these methods also represent esti-
mations of the energy needs of the healthy child.30 Predictive 
equations for determining energy requirements can be used initially and are summarized in Table 2.
The DRI for protein
19 is typically used to estimate protein 
needs for both the healthy child and the hospitalized child. However, the child’s clinical status should be considered when estimating protein requirements. Some situations may require protein intakes greater than the DRI to achieve a positive nitro-gen balance (eg, major surgery, wound healing, infection, catch-up growth). Conversely, some situations (eg, critically ill patient with acute renal failure) may warrant moderate protein restriction. A comprehensive discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this article but may be found elsewhere in the literature.
30,34-38
Growth Parameters
Growth is the primary outcome measure of nutritional status in children.
21,30,39 Growth should be monitored at regular inter -
vals throughout childhood and adolescence and should also be measured every time a child presents, in any healthcare setting, for preventive, acute, or chronic care. In children less than 36 months of age, measures of growth include length-for-age, weight-for-age, head circumference-for-age, and weight-for-length. In children ages 2–20 years, standing height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age are typi-cally collected.
40–44
Anthropometric measures of growth are typically expressed 
and reported in comparison with population data. Traditionally, these measures are expressed as percentiles and express the rank or position of a child’s measurements on a standard refer -
ence curve. Percentiles indicate the portion of the reference population that lies above or below that of the child being mea-sured. It is used to help parents understand where their child “fits” in a population of children of similar ages, heights, and/or weights. The charts are designed so that growth trends in the individual child can be observed over time and growth prob-lems, when detected, addressed in a timely manner.
40 However, 
a percentile does not reveal the actual degree of deviation from population norms. The percentile will always be positive because the bell-shaped curve, statistically, has an infinite tail on both sides.
More recently, growth charts that facilitate comparisons of 
units of standard deviation from norms for reference age groups, z score (SD) comparisons, are recommended for

tracking and assessing nutritional status in children.21,44,45 A z 
score is a statistical measure that tells how a single data point 
compares with normal data and, if above or below “average,” how atypical the measurement is. Growth measurements that cross z score lines indicate possible risk. Children who are 
growing and developing normally will be on or between −1 and 1 z scores of a given indicator. Interpretation of the signifi-cance of z score data is based on the point at which, in the child’s pattern of growth, the change began and the child’s health status relative to the point and progression of change.
21,46,47
The CDC recommends that the WHO comparative data 
charts be used as normative standards for U.S. children from birth to 2 years of age and that the CDC comparative data charts be used as normative standards for U.S. children ages 2–20 years.
44 According to the CDC, growth charts are not 
intended for use as a sole diagnostic instrument but contribute to the formation of an overall clinical impression of the child being assessed.
Weight Gain Velocity
Mehta et al21 suggest that a better definition of malnutrition 
should include goals of early identification of children at risk for malnutrition and the development of thresholds for inter -
vention. One criterion for the early identification of undernu-trition is the assessment of growth velocity and its comparison with a standard. The A.S.P.E.N. workgroup included growth within its 5 domains, as part of the construct of the definition of pediatric malnutrition.
21
Growth is defined as an increase in size and the develop-
ment to maturity, and growth velocity is defined as the rate of change in weight or length/height over time. This rate of change can be interpreted as an early sign of healthy or unhealthy response to the nutritional environment.
48 Upon ini-
tial presentation, length for children under 24 months of age and height for children greater than 24 months of age reflect the child’s nutritional status over a prolonged period of time. A negative z score can be used to determine pediatric malnutri-
tion when only a single data point is available. Over time, declines in z scores for length/height can also be used as a char -
acteristic to determine undernutrition.
Average daily/monthly rates of weight gain that allow a 
child to remain stable on a growth curve occur when adequate nutrient intake takes place. These rates are determined by the trajectory of the growth curve and vary by age and period of development. During periods of growth, an average daily or monthly weight gain is required for the child to remain stable on the growth curve. Very low weight velocity, as occurs with lack of weight gain, and weight loss in a child has been noted to be “independently and more closely related to mortality than other indicators of malnutrition, such as BMI for age.”
49
There is a tremendous amount of plasticity in growth in the 
short term. This adaptive response is seen when an event such as illness or trauma occurs that results in cessation of growth. With ongoing adequate nutrient intake, the child recovers and “catch-up growth” with greater than normal rates of weight gain velocity results.
50
Mid–Upper Arm Circumference
MUAC should be measured when assessing the nutritional sta-tus of pediatric patients.
20 MUAC can be used as an indepen-
dent anthropometric assessment tool in determining malnutrition in children 6–59 months of age when compared with the standards developed by WHO.
51 Though reference 
ranges with standard deviations are not available for older chil-dren and adolescents, Frisancho
52 provides percentile guide-
lines for ages 1–79 years. MUAC has been correlated to BMI in children
53,54 and adults55 and has shown to be more sensitive 
to changes in muscle and fat mass than BMI in adults.55
MUAC measurements should be part of the full anthropo-
metric assessment in all patients and are particularly impor -
tant in those whose weight may be affected by lower extremity edema, ascites, or steroids, as weight trends alone are unreli-able in relation to fluid status. When serial z  scores are 
unavailable, serial MUAC measurements can be used to mon-itor changes in body composition by using the child as his or her own control. MUAC has been indicated as a more sensi-tive prognostic indicator for mortality than weight-for-height parameters in malnourished pediatric patients.
56,57 It is advis-
able to have trained individuals consistently perform these measurements for the best long-term comparison of data.
Handgrip Strength
Handgrip strength is a simple noninvasive measurement commonly used to measure baseline functional status and track progress throughout the course of therapy. Using a handheld dynamometer, subjects perform a series of stan-dardized movements that measure the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The dynamometer is a simple noninvasive and low-cost instrument to measure functional status.
In the hospitalized setting, handgrip strength has been 
shown to predict postoperative complications, length of hospi-tal admission, readmission, likelihood of returning to previous home setting, and mortality.
58 Because muscle function reacts 
earlier to changes in nutritional status than muscle mass, handgrip strength may be a more acute measurement of response to nutritional interventions than traditional biochem-ical or anthropometric measurements in children ages 6 years and older.
59 In hospitalized pediatric patients, handgrip 
strength has been used as a simple noninvasive test of func-tional capacity at admission for surgery. BMI z  scores corre-
lated with the admission handgrip strength measurement, regardless of gender, age, disease severity, or anthropometric characteristics.

Becker et al  157
Accurate handgrip measurements require procedure stan-
dardization. Equipment calibration, adequate staff training 
(patient positioning/dynamometer setting), and use of the appropriate reference range (device dependent) are important components in ensuring accurate results.
58–60 Appropriate age- 
and gender-specific reference ranges must be used. In pediatric populations, handheld dynamometry has been proven feasible and reliable across a wide age range (6 years and older) and multiple diagnoses; however, normal reference ranges in large populations have not been established. Mild, moderate, and severe deficit ranges as measured by handgrip strength have not been established; thus, handgrip strength can help to iden-tify the presence of malnutrition but not to quantify the degree of the deficit.
Proxy Measures as Substitutes for 
Traditional Anthropometric Measures
In selected diseases or conditions, physical anomalies or 
patient frailty may limit the clinician’s ability to obtain the typical anthropometric measurements used to assess growth. A number of alternative measurements have been used in such instances to estimate weight and length. The clinician is encouraged to review relevant literature to determine which measures offer the greatest accuracy in the clinical context in which the patient presents.
20,61
Documentation of Tanner Stage
There is a well-recognized association between normal puber -
tal development and nutritional status; however, determinants of the age of onset of puberty are multifactorial. Although Tanner stage cannot be used as a marker of nutritional status in prepubescent children, it may nonetheless be useful as an indi-rect indicator in preteens and adolescents who have entered puberty, when Tanner progression or stagnation may be influ-enced by nutritional status.
The onset of puberty varies from individual to individual 
with a range of about 5 years.
62 Basic inherited genetic deter -
minants interact with environmental influences to trigger the onset of puberty.
62 Pubertal development is classically staged 
by a set of physical parameters described by Marshall and Tanner.
63,64 Reports from developing countries indicate that 
girls with lower weight and height are at lower Tanner stages than their peers of the same age
65,66 U.S. data from the last 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988–1994) found a significant discordance for Tanner staging between the physical parameters for boys and girls if the weight and BMI were above or below the mean of children in their same age group.
67
The use of Tanner staging as a nutrition marker is limited by 
the significant degree of variability in genetic determinants for the onset of puberty from one child to another. There is also the currently unknown correlation of how pubertal development could be altered to a greater or lesser extent depending on the degree of malnutrition. This is certainly a fertile area for fur -
ther research.
Classifying Pediatric Malnutrition
Historically, pediatric malnutrition related to undernutrition has been classified as a percentage of ideal body weight. This type of distribution of percentages of ideal body weight was first described by Gomez et al,
41 who demonstrated a correla-
tion between the severity of undernutrition and death. The Gomez Classification
41 and the Waterlow Criteria68 use this 
standard and define mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition as 76%–90%, 61%–75%, and <60%
41 and 80%–89%, 70%–79%, 
and <70%,68 respectively.
In the past, the definitions of undernutrition and failure to 
thrive included decreases in 2 centile channels or faltering growth as weight below the fifth percentile.
68–70 A deceleration 
of weight over time has also been used to define malnutrition.71 
The use of z score, decline in z score, and negative z score to identify and document pediatric malnutrition/undernutrition is now recommended.
Classification of undernutrition using MUAC measures 
was suggested in children between the ages of 6 and 60 months. Children who are severely malnourished are defined as those with measurements of less than 11.5 cm, moderately malnour -
ished as those with measurements between 11.5 and 12.4 cm, and at risk of malnutrition as those with measurements between 12.5 and 13.4 cm.
72
An analysis by WHO and UNICEF showed that children 
with a weight-for-height z score less than −3 SD were at a 9-fold greater risk of death than children with a z score of −1 SD.
21 Similar studies using MUAC as a diagnostic criteria 
showed that risk of dying increased with measures of 11.5 cm.
73–77
Mild malnutrition related to undernutrition is usually the 
result of an acute event, either due to economic circumstances or acute illness, and presents with unintentional weight loss or weight gain velocity less than expected. Moderate malnutrition related to undernutrition occurs due to undernutrition of a sig-nificant duration that results in weight-for-length/height values or BMI-for-age values that are below the normal range. Severe malnutrition related to undernutrition occurs as a result of pro-longed undernutrition and is most frequently quantified by declines in rates of linear growth that result in stunting.
On initial presentation, a child may have only a single data 
point for use as a criterion for the identification and diagnosis of malnutrition related to undernutrition. When this is the case, the use of z scores for weight-for-height/length, BMI-for-age, length/height-for-age or MUAC criteria as stated in Table 3 is indicated.
When a child presents with historical medical information 
and 2 or more data points are available for use as criteria for  
the identification and diagnosis of malnutrition related to

port malnutrition’s (undernutrition) identification and diagno-sis. The 1982 Foman data are still being used as growth velocity standards, but we recommend using the WHO data for patients <2 years of age.
78
Nutrition Surveillance and Continuity of 
Care
Once the diagnosis of pediatric undernutrition is made, it is 
crucial to determine how often nutritional status should be monitored and what processes will be established to ensure continuity of care between settings. These questions require answers that ensure improved outcomes for the child with this diagnosis.
One of the mandates of the Affordable Care Act and “mean-
ingful use” is to facilitate care transition across the healthcare system.
79 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
will require monitoring and reevaluation of patients’ health conditions and that continuation of care is planned, executed, and documented (see www.HealthIT.gov). A specific time-frame for these requirements has yet to be delineated. Providing nutrition surveillance will undoubtedly improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission rates. The Nutrition Care Process
80 
provides guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of nutrition therapy provided. The ideal frequency for nutrition surveil-lance, however, remains elusive.
It will be difficult to standardize follow-up surveillance 
intervals because of the great variation in severity of growth failure, nutritional habits, coexisting morbidities, chronic disease(s), social situations, and so on.
81–84 Optimally, follow-
up intervals for pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition), like any other medical condition, should be individualized.
Call to Action: Next Steps
This consensus statement represents a starting point in the effort to standardize a diagnostic approach to the identifica-tion and documentation of pediatric undernutrition. It is important that all clinicians caring for pediatric patients use the recommended diagnostic indicators to identify and docu-ment nutritional status in children and adolescents. It is also imperative that clinicians make every effort to obtain and enter numerical data into searchable fields in the electronic medical record, in order to make tracking within and among institutions feasible.
Members of the healthcare team should come together to 
determine strategies for implementation compatible with their own institution’s policies and practices. Standardized formats for the collection of data associated with each indicator’s use are needed in order to validate and determine which character -
istics are the most or least reliable in the identification of pedi-atric undernutrition and its treatment. Uniform data collection across facilities at local, regional, and national levels would facilitate feasibility testing on a broad scale. The indicators recommended in this consensus statement should be reviewed and revised at regular intervals to reflect validation data that offer evidence of efficacy.

Becker et al  159
We also need to begin to develop systems that track the dis-
eases or conditions and the environmental or socioeconomic 
circumstances that contribute to, or that are routinely associ-ated with, the development of pediatric undernutrition. The human and financial impact of the routine use of the recom-mended indicators in such areas as resource utilization, reve-nue generation, and personnel needed to adequately address the needs of undernourished children and adolescents in acute, ambulatory, home, and residential care settings should also be tracked.
The education and training needs of nutrition, medical, and 
allied health professionals should be determined, with appro-priate outreach initiated to remediate identified deficits. Additional training in the nutrition assessment protocol recom-mended and in the development and utilization of electronic systems that facilitate data collection in this highly vulnerable and costly segment of our population should be offered in mul-tiple venues as specific identified needs arise.
Summary
The recommended indicators to diagnose pediatric undernutri-tion delineated in this consensus statement are a work in prog-ress. Clinicians should expect to see an evolution of these recommendations as data regarding their use are systemati-cally collected, analyzed, and disseminated to research and clinical communities. Periodic review and revision of our rec-ommendations will ensure that the health of the public is opti-mized and that utilization of healthcare resources proceeds with maximum efficiency.
