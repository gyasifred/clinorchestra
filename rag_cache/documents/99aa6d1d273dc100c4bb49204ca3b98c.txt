challenges of accurate assessment in
clinical trials

Abstract
The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment or SOFA score was developed to assess the acute morbidity of critical
illness at a population level and has been widely validated as a tool for this purpose across a range of healthcare
settings and environments.
In recent years, the SOFA score has become extensively used in a range of other applications. A change in the
SOFA score of 2 or more is now a defining characteristic of the sepsis syndrome, and the European Medicines
Agency has accepted that a change in the SOFA score is an acceptable surrogate marker of efficacy in exploratory
trials of novel therapeutic agents in sepsis. The requirement to detect modest serial changes in a patients ’SOFA
score therefore means that increased clarity on how the score should be assessed in different circumstances is
required.
This review explores the development of the SOFA score, its applications and the challenges associated with
measurement. In addition, it proposes guidance designed to facilitate the consistent and valid assessment of the
score in multicentre sepsis trials involving novel therapeutic agents or interventions.
Conclusion
The SOFA score is an increasingly important tool in defining both the clinical condition of the individual patient
and the response to therapies in the context of clinical trials. Standardisation between different assessors in
widespread centres is key to detecting response to treatment if the SOFA score is to be used as an outcome in
sepsis clinical trials.

Background
The SOFA score has become integrated into a range of
aspects of critical care since its development in the early
1990s, and it is now widely employed in the daily monitor-
ing of acute morbidity in critical care units. The SOFA
score was designed to provide population level insights
into the acute morbidity of ICU patients; however, its
application has broadened substantially in recent years.
Following the development of new definitions [ 1–3], it is
now used as a key criterion in the diagnosis of the sepsis
syndrome on an individual patient level [ 3]. It is alsoincreasingly used to determine the efficacy of novel thera-
peutic agents in phase II trials, a development that follows
acceptance by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
and others of organ dysfunction scores as an endpoint in
exploratory trials for sepsis [ 4].
This review describes the development of the score
and the challenges associated with robust and reprodu-
cible calculation and proposes guidance for its assess-
ment in clinical trials, where inconsistency in SOFA
score measurement could introduce substantial variabil-
ity in key outcomes.
The development of the SOFA score
The SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score
was developed following a consensus meeting in 1994,

the stated aim of which was to create a score ‘to de-
scribe quantitively and as objectively as possible the
degree of organ dysfunction/failure over time in
groups of patients or even individual patients ’[5].
The score was designed to describe a sequence of
complications of critical illness and not to predict
outcome, although the authors acknowledged that
any functional morbidity score must also be associ-
ated with mortality. Initia lly described as the sepsis-
related organ failure assessment, the utility of the
score for the assessment of acute morbidity in a range
of critical illnesses was r ecognised early and the title
changed.
SOFA was based on six different scores, one for each
of the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation,
renal and neurological systems each scored from 0 to 4
with an increasing score reflecting worsening organ dys-
function [ 5,6]. The development team showed retro-
spectively that the score detected differences in severity
of illness [ 5] and proposed its use as an alternative to
other assessments of multiple organ dysfunction that
had been developed in the early 1990s [ 7].
Following its initial validation, prospective analysis of
the score ’s utility was undertaken in 16 countries [ 6].
The study showed that some sub-scores and also the
total score were associated with survival. Moreno et al.
[8] studied the impact of maximum SOFA score in the
same population and showed that there was a good cor-
relation between increasing score and mortality. The
score performed well as a discriminator of survival status
at ICU discharge. In addition to studying the maximum
SOFA score, the change in score, or delta SOFA (total
maximum SOFA score minus admission total SOFA
score) also demonstrated a strong correlation with ICU
mortality.
Further prospective evaluations in differing settings
have validated the SOFA score, its maximum value dur-
ing ICU stay and also change in SOFA over time as valid
tools for the assessment of morbidity in critical illness
[9–12], and the score has become a common feature of
observational study reporting.
Calculation of the SOFA score standard approach
SOFA score may traditionally be calculated on admis-
sion to ICU and at each 24-h period that follows. The
tool employs six criteria reflecting the function of an
organ system (respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, neuro-
logical, hepatic and haematological) and allocates a score
of 0 –4 as described below in Table 1.
In cases where the physiological parameters do not
match any row, zero points are given. In cases where
the physiological parameters match more than one row,

SOFA score terminology
The SOFA score has been applied in a range of applica-
tions with some variation in the terminology employed.
A number of terms are commonly used and are associ-
ated with the following definitions:
/C15Admission SOFA: The admission SOFA score is
calculated based on the most severe value for
each sub-score in the 24 h preceding admission
to ICU [ 9].
/C15Daily Maximum SOFA score: The daily maximum
SOFA score is equivalent to the daily SOFA score as
when calculated for each 24 h assessment; the most
severe value of each sub-score for that time period
should be calculated in the assessment of the SOFA
score.
/C15Maximum SOFA score: The maximum SOFA score
describes the highest daily SOFA score over the
course of the study period.
/C15Delta SOFA score: The delta SOFA is calculated as
the change in total SOFA score (or that of an
individual sub-score) between a defined time point
and the baseline value. The baseline value may be
the admission SOFA or a defined study day.
/C15Mean SOFA: The mean SOFA score is calculated
for an individual patient over the course of a defined
study period based on the total SOFA score for each
study day.
Generic rules for measuring components of the SOFA
score
A number of standard rules have been proposed for the
calculation of SOFA score values [ 9].
Selecting the daily value
The value for each sub-score that represents the most
severe (worst) value for the respective 24-h period for
each parameter was used in initial validation and subse-
quent clinical studies using the SOFA score.
Proposal 1 SOFA score should be undertaken prior to
the start of any intervention or admission and for each
subsequent 24-h period. At each assessment, the worst
(most severe) value for the 24-h period of each SOFA
sub-score is selected.
Proposal 2 If data points arise in more than one score
for a subcategory, the higher SOFA sub-score criteria is
selected.
Handling missing data
In their initial development of the SOFA score, Vincent
et al. [ 5] dealt with a single missing value by calculating
a replacement from the mean of the sum of the valuesimmediately preceding the missing value. Moreno et al.
used the mean of the preceding and immediately suc-
ceeding values [ 6,8], with two consecutive missing re-
sults leading to the value be treated as a missing data
point. Other groups have used the last observation car-
ried forward (LOCF) approach in the event of missing
values [ 13], although this approach will not be effective
for data missing on the first study day, and how this pos-
sibility may be handled using methods such as carrying
back a succeeding value or using the pre-randomisation
score should be considered.
In the event of death during the assessment period,
data for some patients, many of whom will have high
scores, will be missing, leading to a survivorship bias
which may paradoxically favour the study group with
higher mortality. As such, it is essential for study teams
to include robust rules for handling this eventuality.
Teams could consider a range of approaches to this
issue. The first of these include imputation of the last re-
corded value for the total or individual sub-score. This
will provide a ‘complete ’data set for analysis; however, it
does not account in any way for patients who do not
survive. A second strategy is to apply a maximum sub-
or total value for patients who do not survive to the end
of the SOFA assessment period. This approach means
that the association of higher SOFA score with outcome
will be preserved in subsequent analyses and the result
is protected from missing data but does not directly ac-
count for early mortality. A third strategy to account for
early mortality is to ascribe an additional penalty in the
event of death during the SOFA assessment period. This
additional penalty ensures that early mortality is ‘in-
cluded ’in the SOFA assessment in addition to acute
morbidity. To date, no consensus has been achieved in
how the issue of missing data due to death should be
handled. The importance of this issue has been recently
highlighted in the CITRIS-ALI trial of vitamin C in pa-
tients with sepsis-associated acute lung injury. In their
study, Fowler et al. demonstrated a reduction in the un-
adjusted secondary outcome of mortality without appar-
ent trend in the primary outcome, the change in a
modified SOFA score [ 14]. In the absence of an imputed
score or penalty for death, patients that did not survive
were removed from the analysis meaning that a differen-
tial impact on delta SOFA may not have been detected.
It is important to recognise that in clinical trials, im-
putation of missing data introduces risks of bias due to
the nature of the missing data and the way it is handled.
Detailed examination of this is beyond the scope of this
review; however, data is considered missing completely
at random (MCAR) if the missing data arises as a conse-
quence of neither the observed nor the missing data.
Missing at random (MAR) data depends only on the ob-
served data, and missing not at random (MNAR) dataLambden et al. Critical Care          (2019) 23:374 Page 3 of 9
arises if the mechanism depends on the missing data;
this dependency remains even given the observed values.
MAR data may be imputed or handled using other
methods without the introduction of systematic bias;
however, if MNAR data is present, this may not be pos-
sible [ 15]. A range of sensitivity analyses are available to
determine the nature of the missing data and should be
included in the statistical analysis plan for any rando-
mised controlled trial [ 16].
Proposal 1 In a clinical trial that employs SOFA score
as a primary or key secondary outcome, centres should
conduct laboratory measurement of the relevant SOFA
variables daily if possible.
Proposal 2 In the event of a missing value, study teams
should define their approach to missing data a priori .
Possible methods include the mean of the preceding and
immediately succeeding values or last observation car-
ried forward. The use of this approach should only apply
to a single missing value and should not be used to im-
pute missing data from two or more days.
Proposal 3 In patients included in randomised con-
trolled trials, a priori rules should be established for
calculating SOFA score and sub-scores in the event of
death prior to the end of the period of SOFA recording.
The central nervous system (CNS) SOFA component
The CNS component of the SOFA score is the least ac-
curately measured and associated with the most errors
[17]. In their initial validations, the Vincent group used
an assumed value for the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in
patients receiving sedation [ 5,6,9] which is associated
with significant variability in the recorded value [ 17].
Other studies have employed a method where last GCS
recorded prior to intubation is carried forward in the
daily assessment until the patient can be examined
neurologically in the absence of sedation. If no value is
recorded prior to intubation, then a normal (GCS 15/15)
value is often inferred [ 18]. Modifications to the SOFA
score to mitigate this variability have been proposed and
are addressed below.
Limited evidence exists for the optimum delay before
reliable assessment of GCS can be made after the hyp-
notic medication is stopped. In cases where confidence
that clearance of sedative agents is complete is essential
such as brain stem death testing, a delay of up to four
times the elimination half-life of the treating agent is
considered the standard in some countries [ 19]. In the
context of SOFA scoring in clinical trials however, this
amount of time is unlikely to be necessary in all cases,
and a pragmatic assessment must be made. In clinical
trials, consistency of assessment across centres andassessors is vital; therefore, design of clinical trial proto-
cols should include assessment rules that minimise the
risk of variability.
Proposal 1 The GCS value will be carried over from the
last pre-intubation GCS throughout the duration of hyp-
notic/sedative medication administration.
if:
GCS from before intubation is not available, a value of
15/15 will be recorded and carried over throughout the
duration of hypnotic/sedative medication administration.
Proposal 2 Formal assessment of GCS can be under-
taken from 24 h after the cessation of sedative medica-
tion by infusion.
if:
The clinician at the bedside is satisfied that the assess-
ment is not affected by ongoing effects of sedative/hyp-
notic therapy.
Proposal 3 In clinical trials, GCS assessment training
should be undertaken by those with responsibility for
formal SOFA scoring. This is of particular relevance if
values are extracted from electronically recorded patient
data.
The respiratory SOFA component
Assessment of the respiratory SOFA score relies on inva-
sive arterial monitoring to measure arterial partial pres-
sure of oxygen followed by calculation of the PaO 2/FiO 2
ratio. This assessment may prove challenging when ar-
terial monitoring is not employed. Some studies have de-
veloped tools to facilitate calculation of a respiratory
SOFA component based on peripheral arterial satura-
tions [ 20], although there is not sufficient evidence base
to recommend this approach at this stage.
In addition to fixed performance (venturi) oxygen
masks, many patients will be treated at some stage in their
care with conventional nasal cannula, standard facemasks
or a mask with reservoir bag, all of which deliver oxygen
at variable flow rates and inspired oxygen percentage. An
approximation of the FiO 2associated with their use may
be employed for SOFA score calculation [ 20]. For patients
on nasal cannula oxygen, an estimated FiO 2may be calcu-
lated by multiplying the litre flow/minute by 0.03 and add-
ing that to 0.21 (Table 2)[20]. Estimation of FiO 2in

(without venturi device) or facemask with a reservoir bag
should be derived from Table 3[21].
The SOFA score calls for patients to receive a score of
3 or 4 if they reach a PaO 2/FiO 2ratio of less than 200 or
less than 100 respectively and are receiving respiratory
support. In addition to invasive and non-invasive ventila-
tors, high flow rate oxygen delivered at a controlled per-
centage via a dedicated nasal cannula has become more
prevalent in the years since the development of the
SOFA score. These devices are reported to offer a fixed
delivered oxygen percentage and a degree of positive
end expiratory pressure (PEEP), although the true in-
spired concentration and amount of PEEP delivered is
dependent on the flow rate and a number of patient fac-
tors and does not exceed 5 cmH 2O[22].
Proposal 1 The PaO2/FiO2 ratio will be calculated for
all patients with an indwelling arterial cannula for any
part of each day and the lowest value for that 24-h
period used to calculate the respiratory SOFA score.
Proposal 2 For patients on nasal cannula oxygen, an es-
timated FiO 2may be calculated by multiplying the litre
flow/minute by 0.03 and adding that to 0.21 or using a
standard table.
Proposal 3 Patients dependent upon high flow nasal
cannula (HFNC) to maintain adequate oxygenation
should have their PaO 2/FiO 2ratio calculated based on
the fraction of inspired oxygen set by the device.
The cardiovascular (CVS) SOFA component
The existing standard SOFA characteristics include a
standard value for the use of dopamine, dobutamine,
epinephrine or norepinephrine. It is now common in
clinical practice to add vasopressin (ADH) and its ana-
logues to the management of septic shock as part of the
standard of sepsis care to reduce norepinephrine dose
required to achieve a target MAP [ 23]. Additional vaso-
pressor agents such as terlipressin and angiotensin II
may be used in some centres and may have a norepin-
ephrine sparing effect although formal evidence of their
dose equivalence with norepinephrine is lacking; there-
fore, agents should be considered when calculating an
equivalent norepinephrine dose.
The conversion table below (Table 4) is derived from a
number of sources [ 24] and allows study teams to in-
clude the dose of vasopressin and other agents as part ofthe SOFA calculation in order to avoid falsely low CVS
SOFA values in patients receiving combination therapy.
The use of defined blood pressure targets can, to some
degree confound the calculation of CVS SOFA based on
vasopressor dose alone; however, in clinical trials with
defined haemodynamic targets, consistency across the
study groups should allow robust comparison of the
CVS SOFA scores based on the guidance offered below
as between group differences in vasopressor requirement
will be reflected in the SOFA calculation.
Proposal 1 Study teams should define the duration of a
period without vasopressor administration that should
elapse before an episode of vasopressor therapy is consid-
ered complete. Receipt of a vasopressor at any point
within the 24-h window of assessment of the SOFA score
should merit a score representing that requirement.
Proposal 2 Vasopressin may be used as a second agent
to reduce total noradrenaline dose. However, the dose of
vasopressin used should be converted to an equivalent
norepinephrine and the ‘total equivalent norepinephrine
dose ’used to determine the CVS SOFA component.
Proposal 3 The peak level of cardiovascular support for
a given 24-h period should be used to calculate the daily
cardiovascular SOFA score.
The renal SOFA component
The surviving sepsis guidelines call for the use of renal
replacement therapy (RRT) in the management of symp-
tomatic renal failure or fluid balance in patients with
haemodynamic instability [ 23]. The SOFA score is based
on the clinical indices of creatinine or urine output, both
of which will be affected by the presence of renal re-
placement therapy. Given the wide variety of application
of renal replacement therapy between ICUs, this could
introduce substantial variability in the SOFA score for
patients included in clinical trials. One approach to this
would be to consider applying a renal sub-score of four
in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy. The
period of time that should elapse after cessation of RRT
before a patient is considered to have been liberated
from renal support is not defined by the literature.
Proposal 1 Study teams should develop a formal strat-
egy for SOFA score calculation in patients undergoing

renal replacement therapy if using the SOFA score as a
key outcome.
The coagulation SOFA component
The haematology component of the SOFA score is cal-
culated using the measured platelet concentration.
The administration of platelet transfusion is not re-
corded during scoring but may have a significant im-
pact on the measured platelet concentrations and
therefore the coagulation component of the SOFA
score. Standard guidance from the surviving sepsis
council exists for the management of platelet therapy
in patients with sepsis [ 23].
Proposal 1 The lowest platelet value for the preceding
24 h should be determined before transfusion (if given),
and if platelets are given regularly, the lowest pre-
transfusion value should be used to calculate each daily
score.
Improving inter-rater reliability in SOFA assessment
Any score that is dependent upon the assessment of
clinical criteria and laboratory variables may be subject
to variation in that assessment. Reasons for this include
different laboratory assays, changes in personnel under-
taking examinations and confounders not measured
within the score.
The calculation of the SOFA score is at risk of each of
these potential pitfalls. In their 2009 study, Tallgren
et al. examined the accuracy of SOFA scoring in a single
centre and determined that assessment of the cardiovas-
cular, renal, haematological and liver sub-scores was
highly accurate with more than 80% of assessments cor-
rect. The respiratory score was correct in 75% of mea-
surements; however, the neurological score was accurate
in only 70% of cases. This inconsistency between clini-
cians meant that only 48% of SOFA scores were fully in
agreement with gold standard assessment and a mean
difference of 0.66 points existed between actual and gold
standard overall SOFA measurement, a degree of vari-
ability that is potentially important in determining mor-
bidity [ 17]. Of note is that expert raters of the SOFAscore achieved high degrees of inter-rater consistency
across all SOFA sub-scores. The pattern of these data
was consistent with an earlier single-centre study of
30 patients, assessed by 20 clinicians [ 26].
The Finnish study demonstrated that a short training
session led to substantial improvements in scoring per-
formance, a reduction in the degree of variation in the
overall score and in the number of errors in the overall
score greater than one or two points [ 17].
Proposal 1 Studies including SOFA scoring as an inclu-
sion criteria or outcome should consider a formal train-
ing package for recruiting centres to reduce inaccuracy
and variability in different centres.
Modified SOFA scores
A number of modifications have been proposed to the
SOFA score including assessments that require fewer la-
boratory measurements. A number of studies have
shown that various components of the score can be re-
moved or replaced by using for example, clinical assess-
ment of jaundice rather than serum bilirubin or urine
output instead of creatinine. The revised respiratory
sub-score using peripheral oxygen saturations discussed
above produced results consistent with the standard
SOFA assessment [ 20,27,28]. Other approaches include
the addition of a further factor such as the time since
last infection which offers increased predictive ability in
specific patient groups, for example in populations with
haematological malignancy [ 29,30].
It has been proposed that the neurological component
of the SOFA score could be replaced with an alternative
measure such as the Richmond Agitation and Sedation
Score (RASS) [ 31]; however, since the RASS is a marker
of sedation and not neurological status, this approach
has not been recommended as an approach by the ori-
ginal developers of the SOFA score [ 32]. An alternative
is that the neurological sub-score could be removed to
produce a five-component modified SOFA (mSOFA)
[33] This approach has proven to be valid and produced
results consistent with the use of GCS to calculate the
CNS component of the score [ 13].
In small studies in specific or centres or environments,
modified SOFA scoring may offer an attractive solution
to some of the challenges of standard SOFA. However,
these tools have not been validated prospectively across
multiple centres and therefore cannot be recommended
as replacement for the traditional approach at this stage.
In addition, some of these scores potentially increase the
likelihood of inaccuracy due to a reduction in the num-
ber of laboratory assays that they employ and depend-
ence on clinical assessment by individuals.Table 4 Guidance for the conversion of vasopressor doses in

Extending the application of SOFA scoring
Defining sepsis
Defining the syndrome of sepsis has proven challenging
since the initial consensus definitions were developed in
the early 1990s [ 34]. The definitions of sepsis and septic
shock were based on expert consensus [ 35–38]. In 2016,
a novel approach saw a data-driven redefinition as:
‘Life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dys-
regulated host response to infection ’[3].
The team demonstrated that SOFA score was a better
discriminant than the traditional SIRS and similarly ef-
fective to the more complex Logistic Organ Dysfunction
System (LODS) [ 1]. Organ dysfunction was therefore
characterised by a change in SOFA score of two or more
points as a consequence of infection, which conferred an
associated mortality of approximately 10%. By using a
change in SOFA score, the authors recognised that
whilst SOFA score can often be considered zero in pre-
viously healthy patients, the presence of chronic organ
dysfunction precludes the use of an absolute value to de-
fine the presence of infection [ 3]. This transition from
observing to defining a syndrome has significant rele-
vance for clinicians and researchers in critical care.
Using SOFA as an outcome in clinical trials
The association of SOFA score at admission and during
ICU stay with long-term outcomes has led a number of
investigators to propose SOFA or delta SOFA as a po-
tentially valid surrogate in clinical trials. This approach
confers the advantage that shorter periods of follow-up
are required to determine efficacy, although this is valid
only if a change in SOFA is a clinically relevant outcome
or that is a true surrogate of a later important outcome.
This approach will have greater validity if, as with all
composite outcomes, study teams also report the sub-
scores that make up the SOFA as part of the trial data.
In the ATHOS-3 trial [ 24], a key secondary end point
was a change in the CVS SOFA score which displayed a
significant improvement over the study period in pa-
tients treated with angiotensin II. Interestingly, the study
did not calculate vasopressor dose equivalence in the
intervention group including angiotensin II, a limitation
that future studies of vasopressors should consider
addressing.
In contrast, the upcoming STRESS-L study of the im-
pact of treatment with the beta blocker Landiolol will
use ‘the mean SOFA score over the first 14 days from
entry to the trial and whilst in ICU ’as the primary out-
come measure in patients with septic shock and a nor-
adrenaline requirement of ≥0.1μg/kg/min [ 39]. This
approach confers the advantage that in the event of a pa-
tient death prior to the end of study, the mean SOFA
score over the period remains comparable across allpatients regardless of duration of survival and means
that no patients are excluded from the end point
analysis.
de Grooth et al. [ 40] interrogated the use of SOFA and
its association with mortality in 87 studies. They looked
at the relationship between using a SOFA at a defined
time point in the study (fixed day SOFA) which allows
comparison of acute morbidity at a defined time point
across study groups and delta SOFA (which was defined
as the change in SOFA score from baseline/maximum to
a defined time point). They demonstrated that using
delta SOFA was significantly correlated with mortality
with a low degree of heterogeneity. A fixed day SOFA as
an endpoint was not reliably associated with mortality.
The authors note that many of the included studies were
small (median (IQR) 64(40 –147) patients).
Discussion
The SOFA score was developed to describe the acute
morbidity of patient populations with critical illness in
different settings. The use of the tool for this purpose
has been repeatedly validated and, over the years that
followed its development, its role has extended to a
range of new indications. It is now a defining character-
istic of the sepsis syndrome which means that interven-
tions and treatments delivered to individual patients
depend on precise and consistent assessment of the
score. In addition, the acceptance by the EMA that in
exploratory clinical trials in sepsis, a change in organ
dysfunction scores is a valid endpoint [ 4], has led to the
change in SOFA score being selected as a primary out-
come in a number of recent and ongoing studies, along-
side the reporting of mortality .
There is evidence from a range of observational study
settings that even a modest change in SOFA score is
associated with a persistent trend in mortality. This in-
cludes a change in SOFA between ICU and ED admis-
sion [ 41] at 48 h in sepsis associated disseminated
intravascular coagulation [ 42], following cardiac arrest
[43] and in general critical illness [ 44] as well as at day 7
in pancreatitis [ 45].
In the context of randomised trials, de Grooth et al.
identified 25 studies where the change in SOFA score
from baseline or maximum to a defined time point was
used and revealed a strong association between change
in SOFA and mortality ( p= 0.004), with 32% of the ob-
served mortality effects explained by the delta SOFA
[40]. They went on to recommend, based on the mean
standard deviation of those studies, that 110 patients
would be required in each treatment arm of a study to
detect a one point difference in delta SOFA. If detected,
they inferred that this would in turn be associated with a
mortality odds ratio of 2. The authors concluded that
aiming to detect a greater difference than this would beLambden et al. Critical Care          (2019) 23:374 Page 7 of 9
unrealistic and therefore this should represent a mini-
mum sample size in studies using delta SOFA as a pri-
mary endpoint. It is important to recognise therefore
that the ability to detect single-integer changes in the
overall SOFA score with low inter-individual and inter-
centre variability becomes essential in the conduct of
randomised trials employing this outcome.
Like all scores that assess the clinical course of critic-
ally ill patients based at least in part upon levels of organ
support and assessments undertaken at single time
points, SOFA scores can, as we describe, be confounded
by clinical interventions. As a consequence, the develop-
ment of standard protocols for the assessment and man-
agement of patients in clinical trials is essential in order
to minimise inter-patient variability and ensure that re-
sults of surrogate assessments like SOFA are robust.
Conclusion
In this review, we propose solutions and pragmatic ap-
proaches to calculating the SOFA score which have the
potential to improve the reliability of assessments and
mitigate some of the sources of heterogeneity that could
prove important in new applications of the score. Train-
ing of study teams in the measurement of the SOFA
score and application of study guidance is an important
part of this process and should be considered in all stud-
ies including the SOFA score as an inclusion criteria or
end point. The evidence base available to determine the
guidance presented here is limited, and study authors
should consider this before defining the approaches they
will take to assessment of the SOFA score. Balancing the
requirement for robust and consistent calculation with
the introduction of unvalidated approaches and the in-
advertent development of a new scoring system is an im-
portant challenge for clinical triallists to address.
