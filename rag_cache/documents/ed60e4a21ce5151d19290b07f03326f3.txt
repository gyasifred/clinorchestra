CHEST INFECTIONS
Original Research     Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), along with 
inﬂ uenza, is the eighth leading cause of death in 
the United States.  1   About 6 million cases are reported 
annually, resulting in an estimated 500,000 to 1.1 mil-lion hospitalizations.  2,3   Treatment costs $8.4 billion to 
$10 billion annually, with the cost of inpatient care 25 times that of outpatient care.  
3   The outcome of CAP 
is extremely variable and depends upon the affected host’s response, the underlying pathogen, and the treatment delivered. Site of care is a major decision in   Background:     Accurate severity assessment is crucial to the initial management of community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP). The CURB-65 (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, BP, age  /H11350  65 years) 
score contains data that are entered routinely in electronic medical records and are, thus, elec-tronically calculable. The aim of this study was to determine whether an electronically generated severity estimate using CURB-65 elements as continuous and weighted variables better predicts 30-day mortality than the traditional CURB-65.   Methods:     In a retrospective cohort study at a US university-afﬁ  liated community teaching hospi-
tal, we identiﬁ  ed 2,069 patients aged 18 years or older with CAP conﬁ  rmed by radiographic ﬁ  nd-
ings in the ED. CURB-65 elements were extracted from the electronic medical record, and 30-day mortality was identiﬁ  ed with the Utah Population Database. Performance of a severity prediction 
model using continuous and weighted CURB-65 variables was compared with the traditional CURB-65 in the US derivation population and validated in the original 1,048 patients from the CURB-65 international derivation study  . 
  Results:     The traditional, binary CURB-65 score predicted mortality in the US cohort with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. Our severity prediction model generated from continuous, weighted CURB-65 elements was superior to the traditional CURB-65, with an out-of-bag AUC of 0.86 ( P   ,  .001). This ﬁ  nding was validated in the international database, with an AUC of 0.85 for 
the electronic model compared with 0.80 for the traditional CURB-65 ( P   5  .01). 
  Conclusions:     Using CURB-65 elements as continuous and weighted data improved prediction of 
30-day mortality and could be used as a real-time, electronic decision support tool or to adjust outcomes by severity when comparing processes of care.   CHEST 2011; 140(1):156–163

 Materials and Methods 
 Study Population 
 The study was performed at Latter-day Saints (LDS) Hospital, 
a university-afﬁ  liated community teaching hospital in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, with 520 beds. An electronic medical record was imple-mented in the ED in 1995, followed that same year by a paper-based, standardized pneumonia treatment protocol.  
17   
 In a retrospective analysis of data in the electronic medical 
record, we identiﬁ  ed all patients  .  18 years of age evaluated in 
the ED at LDS Hospital from 1996 to 2006 with  International 
Statistical Classiﬁ  cation of Diseases, 9th edition   (ICD-9) codes 
 speciﬁ  c for a primary diagnosis of pneumonia (480-487.1), or 
respi ratory failure or sepsis (518.x, 038.x) as a primary diagnosis 
with pneumonia secondary. Patients diagnosed with aspiration pneu-monia (507.0), immunocompromised conditions including AIDS or receipt of antiretroviral therapy (042), solid organ transplants (v420-7), hematologic malignancies (v106.x, 200.x, 208.x), and those meeting criteria for health-care-associated pneumonia  
18   were 
excluded. We included only the ﬁ  rst episode of pneumonia in a given 
12-month period; however, 45 individuals presented with more than one case of pneumonia outside a 12-month period. Chest radiograph and CT scan reports upon admission to the ED were manually reviewed for radiographic evidence of pneumonia by three physicians, with a three-way  k  agreement score of 0.95 for 
a random sample of 100 reports. Patients lacking radiographic evidence for pneumonia were excluded. This study was approved by the LDS Hospital institutional review board   and the Utah Pop-ulation Database. Patient consent was not required. 
 Validation Cohort 
 Patient records contained in the database from the prior inter-
national CURB-65 derivation and validation study  
11   were used to 
validate the model derived in our population. The study included patients with CAP in England, The Netherlands, and New Zealand. Exclusion criteria were similar to our study, with the exception that only patients admitted to the hospital as an emergency were included. Data for calculation of CURB-65 were recorded pro-spectively upon hospital admission, with 30-day all-cause mortal-ity determined during follow-up. 
 Measurements 
 The ﬁ  rst 6 hours of vital signs, orientation status (entered rou-
tinely during nursing assessment), and the ﬁ  rst 12 hours of routine 
laboratory results were extracted from the electronic medical record. A manual review of 50 charts showed  .  90% agreement 
between electronic and paper records; the majority of the dis-agreements were minor discrepancies in BP that were not signiﬁ  -
cant enough to result in a change in CURB-65 classiﬁ  cation. The 
methodology of an electronic, continuous-weighted CURB-65 requires a speciﬁ  c value for BUN. The PSI and CURB-65 conven-
tionally assume normality for missing data. Additionally, CRB-65 has been validated as a predictive score for patients lacking a BUN.  
11,15,19    Of   the 304 patients missing BUN values, 268 were not 
admitted to the hospital. Therefore, for patients lacking a BUN determination, we imputed a median BUN matched by age quartile derived from nonadmitted patients in our cohort (e-Table 2  ). This same imputation was applied to the 40 patients with missing the management of pneumonia and is guided by esti-
mated severity of the patient’s disease.  4,5   However, 
variability in physician decision making regarding the need for hospital admission has been repeatedly dem-onstrated.  
6-8   Therefore, accurate severity assessment 
during initial management is critical. 
 Two severity assessment tools have become widely 
used by clinicians to help distinguish high-risk patients who require inpatient management from those able to thrive with outpatient management. The pneu-monia severity index (PSI) developed by Fine and colleagues  
9   is a prognostic model that calculates a 
severity-of-illness score based on 20 separate patient characteristics, including underlying comorbidities. The CURB-65 score is composed of ﬁ  ve separate ele-
ments: confusion, uremia  , respiratory rate, BP, and age  /H11350  65 years ( Table 1  ). This was initially developed 
by the British Thoracic Society in 1987 as the CRB criteria,  
10   later modiﬁ  ed to the CURB-65 and vali-
dated by Lim et al  11   in an international, multicenter 
derivation/validation study from Nottingham, England; Christchurch and Waikato, New Zealand; and Alkmaar, The Netherlands. 
 Both the PSI and the CURB-65 are accepted meth-
ods of assessing severity by the American Thoracic Society  
4  ; the British Thoracic Society recommends 
use of the CURB-65.  5   Although the PSI has been 
shown to be slightly more accurate at predicting out-come,  
12-16   CURB-65 is simpler to use. Additionally, 
all elements of the CURB-65 are routinely entered into the electronic medical record, making it possible to generate a mortality prediction automatically for each patient at the point of care. 
 CURB-65 attributes a point to each criterion in a 
dichotomous and equally weighted fashion. However, excluding confusion, CURB-65 elements are actually continuous variables that may not be of equal predic-tive value. CURB-65, therefore, may be more accurate if calculated with continuous and weighted variables. Instead of a severity score, a computer could generate an individualized mortality risk estimate using data elements from the electronic medical record. Gener-ating an automated, accurate mortality estimate imme-diately available to providers could improve severity assessment and thus improve care. 
 Our aims were to: 
 1. Validate the CURB-65 severity assessment tool 
in patients with CAP presenting to a US ED using information from the electronic medical record. 
 2. Examine whether a computer-generated CURB-65 
using continuous and weighted variables avail-able electronically (e-Table 1) improves accu-racy in mortal ity prediction over the traditional 
dichot omous CURB-65. 
158 Original ResearchED reduced the number to 2,076 cases in 2,027 patients. 
Seven patients lacked an electronic record of ori-
entation, respiratory rate, or systolic BP during the 
6-h time window, and were, therefore, excluded from 
analysis. The resulting study population comprised 2,069 cases, of which 58% resulted in admission to the hospital ( Fig 1  ). In the validation cohort, 20 patients lacked a vital sign and were thus excluded from the comparison. 
 Seventy percent of the patients in the LDS Hospi-
tal cohort presented with a CURB-65 score of 0 or 1. The mean age was 57 years, and 48% were women. Compared with the international CURB-65 valida-tion study, our study population was younger (mean age 57 vs 64 years,  P   ,  .001 by Welch  t  test), had a 
lower mortality rate (4.1% vs 9.1%,  P   ,  .001 by Fisher 
exact test), and included patients discharged from the ED as well as those admitted to the hospital ( Table 2  ). Of the patients from our study population who were admitted to the hospital, the age (64 years, SD 19 years) and mortality rate (6.8%) were not sig-niﬁ cantly different from the international study pop-
ulation ( P 
  5  .931 and .059, respectively, by Fisher 
exact test). 
 A strong relationship between mortality and 
CURB-65 score was demonstrated, with a mortality rate of 2.1% for patients with a CURB-65 score of 1 vs 7.7% for those with a CURB-65 score of 2. This relationship was similar to that found in the interna-tional cohort ( Fig 2  ). 
 Effect plots  
26   for the CURB-65 elements are shown 
in  Figure 3  . CURB-65 thresholds are represented by a vertical line. The effect plots for age, BUN, and respiratory rate suggest polytonic   relationships with 30-day mortality; few patients had extreme values and the conﬁ  dence intervals at these points are wide. 
  Figure 4A   shows the performance of the dichot-
omous CURB-65 (AUC
  5  0.82) compared with the 
penalized logistic regression model using continuous, spline transformed values (AUC
  5  0.87) for the LDS 
Hospital data ( P   ,  .001) The AUC is known to be 
overestimated using the same data to train and test the model. The out-of-bag AUC estimate for the logistic regression model was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80-0.91). 
 Figure 4B   shows the performance of the CURB-65 
score (AUC
  5  0.80) compared with the model derived 
from the LDS Hospital data and applied to the inter-national data (AUC
  5  0.85). This shows a statistically 
signiﬁ  cant improvement in predictive performance 
( P   5  .01). Our derived electronic CURB-65 model is 
available in e-Tables 1-4 for application. 
 Discussion 
 Our study demonstrates that the traditional 
CURB-65 pneumonia severity score reliably predicts BUN values in the validation cohort. The outcome measure 
of 30-day all-cause mortality was determined by both the Inter-mountain Healthcare electronic database and the Utah Population Database.  
20   
 Because many patients had several measurements of CURB 
elements during their ED evaluation, we created summary mea-sures (ﬁ  rst, last, minimum, and maximum) to determine which 
measure to carry forward. The summary measure for each ele-ment was selected in a forward stepwise selection procedure using out-of-bag area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic as a selection criterion. The ﬁ  rst measurements of 
vital signs and orientation status performed as well or better than subsequent measurements and were thus used in the analysis. Additionally, systolic BP was used, as it was found to be nonsig-niﬁ cantly better than diastolic BP, and the latter did not add any 
additional predictive value. 
 Statistical Analysis 
 In the derivation (US) cohort, we compared 30-day mortality 
for the CURB-65 model vs a lasso penalized logistic regression model. Nonlinear effects were expected for CURB-65 elements, so natural cubic splines with three knots were applied to the BUN, respiratory rate, BP, and age elements. The lasso penalty (L1-5) was imposed on the logistic regression parameters to prevent overﬁ  tting, especially at extreme values and after using spline 
transforms.  
21   
 In order to avoid overestimating modeling performance during 
the derivation phase, the prediction modeling strategy was evalu-ated within the derivation cohort using a bootstrap sampling method.  
22   The method resulted in 63.2% of the original observa-
tions (“in-the-bag”) available to construct the logistic regression model and 36.8% of observations withheld (“out-of-bag”) for assessing predictive performance across each of 1,000 iterations. The ﬁ  nal model sent to the international cohort for validation was 
based on the entire US derivation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic curves and  P  values for differences between the 
discrete CURB-65 score and the logistic regression model were then calculated and compared between the US and the interna-tional cohorts.  
23,24   Analyses were performed using the R   statistical 
package, version 2.9 (www.r-project.org).  25

near the dichotomous cutpoints may be more accu-rately assessed with eCURB than CURB-65. For example, a 62-year-old man who is oriented  3  3 with 
a BUN of 44 mg/dL, a BP of 95/65 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 28/min, although scoring 1 by the CURB-65 (mortality rate 2%), would generate a 30-day mortality estimate of 14% by the eCURB. The eCURB method is contained in e-Tables 1-4, which allows the user to enter values to estimate 30-day mortality. We believe that eCURB will be most use-ful as a method of severity assessment for a personal data assistant or automated as part of a real-time elec-tronic medical record. The methodology is simple enough to be widely used in different electronic plat-forms, not confined to EDs with fully electronic medical records. A more accurate, fully automated severity assessment tool is likely to be more useful 30-day all-cause mortality in a large population of 
ED patients with pneumonia in a North American community teaching hospital, comparable to results obtained abroad. This validation was achieved using data elements routinely entered in the electronic medical record. We were able to improve this predic-tive power by preserving the continuous nature of BUN, respiratory rate, BP , and age. We have vali-dated this approach in an independent, prospectively identiﬁ  ed, and more severely ill population in an 
international pneumonia database.  
11   
 This more accurate pneumonia severity prediction 
model (hereafter referred to as eCURB) could be implemented as a real-time, electronic decision sup-port tool. In contrast to the PSI, no predictors beyond those routinely present in the electronic record are required. The eCURB calculates a point estimate of 30-day mortality, instead of lumping mortality risk   Figure   1. Study population. HCAP  5  health-care-acquired pneumonia.

 Our ED database is distinct from many large pneu-
monia study populations.  9,11   It includes not only hos-
pital inpatients but also patients discharged home from the ED and managed as outpatients, thereby providing representation of patients with less severe disease. The cohort of patients used for validation of our prediction model contained only patients admit-ted to the hospital. Although both CURB-65 score and the eCURB had lower predictive performance in the international data, the relative superiority of the eCURB was similar in both cohorts. 
 Our study has limitations. It is retrospective and 
relies upon ICD-9 coding rather than prospective screening. In The Netherlands and Sweden, this methodology missed some pneumonias, particularly in patients with prolonged hospital admissions.  
30,31   In 
the United States and particularly in our hospital, however, ICD-9 codes have demonstrated reason-able sensitivity for diagnosis of CAP .  
32,33   The speciﬁ  c-
ity of our technique was augmented by manual review of chest radiology reports. In addition, our use of real-time electronic charting for recording data signiﬁ  -
cantly reduces the missing values generally associated with retrospective analyses. Validation of eCURB in the international database is also reassuring, as 
these patients were prospectively identiﬁ  ed using 
different methodology. Our use of both Intermoun-tain Health care and the Utah Population Databases 
to track statewide mortality further strengthens our 
analysis, although some out-of-state deaths may have escaped detection. 
 Calculation of CURB-65 using continuous and 
weighted variables is a logical extension of prior work, easily accomplished by a computer or personal digital assistant. Future research is directed toward further  Electronic severity prediction could be integrated 
with other guideline elements in a clinical decision support tool available at the point of care. Although the pneumonia guideline implementation in our health-care system has been more successful than most,  
28   provider use of severity assessment as a 
decision support tool has lagged behind use of other guideline elements. Automatic calculation of individ-ualized risk prediction as part of a comprehensive decision support tool that can be adapted to local needs could be an important strategy for local implemen-tation of national pneumonia treatment guidelines, as recommended by the British Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Thoracic Society.  
4,5   The ultimate clinical 
decision support tool would integrate severity assess-ment and triage recommendations with additional manage ment guidelines, such as antibiotic selection and duration. 
 Beyond decision support, the eCURB could also be 
used to improve severity adjustment methods when comparing quality of care between hospitals. The US Center for Medicare Service’s Hospital Compare (www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) assesses outcomes and performance measures among hospitals, making results available to the public for common medical conditions, including CAP. However, analysis has shown only a modest relationship between adherence to performance measures and outcome, suggesting that attention should be focused on identifying mea-sures more tightly linked to outcome.  
29   Hospital 
Compare makes risk adjustments using past medical history and comorbidities, but it does not adjust for severity of illness upon presentation. A more accurate severity-adjusted mortality estimate might improve comparisons of mortality in the absence of reliable performance measures. Calculating eCURB would   Figure   4.

ables found to inﬂ  uence mortality, investigating per-
formance of eCURB in predicting in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and the need for hospital admission. 
In addition, the improved severity estimate should be integrated into a real-time electronic pneumonia decision support tool, followed by implementation at the point of care. The ultimate test of electronic admis-sion decision support will be to evaluate its inﬂ  uence 
on admission rate, mortality, length of stay, and cost.
