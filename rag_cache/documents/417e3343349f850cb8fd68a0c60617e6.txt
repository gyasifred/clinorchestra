doi:10.1016/mem.2004.430Derivation of the San Francisco Syncope Rule to
Predict Patients With Short-Term Serious Outcomes 
See editorial, p. 233.
Study objective: The causes of syncope are usually benign but are occasionally
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We derive a decision rule thatwould predict patients at risk for short-term serious outcomes and help guide admis-sion decisions. 
Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a university teaching
hospital and used emergency department (ED) patients presenting with syncope ornear syncope. Physicians prospectively completed a structured data form when eval-uating patients with syncope. Serious outcomes (death, myocardial infarction,arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, significant hem-orrhage, or any condition causing a return ED visit and hospitalization for a relatedevent) were defined at the start of the study. All patients were followed up to deter-mine whether they had experienced a serious outcome within 7 days of their ED visit.Univariate analysis was performed with r
2and nonparametric techniques on all pre-
dictor variables. gAnalysis was performed on variables requiring interpretation.
Variables with gmore than 0.5 and a Pvalue less than .1 were analyzed with recur-
sive partitioning techniques to develop a rule that would maximize the determinationof serious outcomes. 
Results: There were 684 visits for syncope, and 79 of these visits resulted in patients’
experiencing serious outcomes. Of the 50 predictor variables considered, 26 wereassociated with a serious outcome on univariate analysis. A rule that considerspatients with an abnormal ECG, a complaint of shortness of breath, hematocrit lessthan 30%, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, or a history of congestiveheart failure has 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 100%) sensitivity and 62%(95% CI 58% to 66%) specificity. If applied to this cohort, the rule has the potential todecrease the admission rate by 10%. 
Conclusion: The San Francisco Syncope Rule derived in this cohort of patients
appears to be sensitive for identifying patients at risk for short-term serious out-comes. If prospectively validated, it may offer a tool to aid physician decisionmaking.

SAN FRANCISCO SYNCOPE RULE Quinn et al
FEBRUARY 2004 43:2 ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE 225cation has limited value in determining which patientsneed aggressive diagnostic workup and warrant acutehospitalization.
21Recommendations  for hospital  admis-
sion should be based on the potential for adverse out-comes if further evaluation and workup is delayed.Several guidelines and recommendations are available,but no prospective  study  has focused  on this issue .
11,13-15
In recent work, we have determined that emergency
physicians can accurately identify patients at risk forserious outcomes within 7 days of their initial visit;however, we found that they still admitted manypatients  with  benign  causes,
22which  led us to believe
that there was great potential for clinical decision rulesto help guide the decision to admit patients presentingwith syncope. In this study , we describe the derivationof the San Francisco Syncope Rule to help predict short-term serious outcomes. 
MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy Setting and Participants
This prospective cohort study was conducted at a
large university teaching hospital and included patientspresenting with acute syncope or near syncope as a rea-son for their ED visit. Research assistants prospectivelyscreened patients with complaints of syncope, loss ofconsciousness, fall, collapse, seizure, light-headedness,tachycardia, bradycardia, shortness of breath, and chestpain. Exclusion criteria were altered mental status,alcohol- or illicit drug–related loss of consciousness, adefinite seizure, or transient loss of consciousnesscaused by head trauma. A research nurse reviewed dailypatient logs and ensured enrollment of all possiblepatients. Prospective patients were identified andbrought to the attention of the attending physician,who made the final decision to enroll the patient. Astudy nurse completed follow-up on all patients todetermine whether they had suffered a serious outcomeby day 7. The Committee on Human Research at theUniversity of California–San Francisco approved thestudy protocol without the need for informed consent.
Standardized Patient Assessment
After assessing the patients, physicians completed a
structured data form. The data form contained 50 pre-dictor variables, which included 34 historical variables,11 variables related to the physical examination, and 5variables involving laboratory , radiograph, and findingson the ECG. These variables were determined to be theINTRODUCTION
Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness with a returnto pre-existing neurologic function. The lifetime risk offainting is 1 in 4, and 1% to 2% of all emergency depart-ment (ED) visits and hospital admissions are related to atransient  loss of consciousness .
1-6More than a million
people are evaluated for syncope each year in the UnitedStates,  with costs  running  in the billions  of dollars .

Patients with syncope create a difficult diagnostic
dilemma. Some patients will require emergency hospi-talization for workup and treatment of life-threateningor potentially life-threatening causes, some shouldreceive outpatient evaluation, and others need no fur-ther evaluation.
10,11The approach  to the evaluation  and
disposition of these patients is considered one of themost  difficult  management  issues  facing  physicians .

Extensive work has focused primarily on the diagnos-
tic workup and treatment of patients presenting with syn-cope.
13-15Despite  intensive  diagnostic  strategies,  20% to
50% of patients will still have unclear reasons for theirsyncope, with high-risk patients having death rates ashigh as 30% within  the first year.

What is already known on this topic
Many patients are admitted to the hospital because of concernsabout potential life-threatening causes of syncope even thoughthe etiology in most patients is benign. Previously, some studieshave shown that characteristics such as an abnormal ECG maypredict higher complication rates.
What question this study addressed
This study of 684 patients prospectively derived a decision rulethat attempts to predict patients at greater risk for short-term (7days) serious outcome.
What this study adds to our knowledge
The 5 risk factors identified in this study (ie, abnormal ECG,anemia, dyspnea, systolic hypotension, history of congestiveheart failure) were 96% sensitive in identifying patients whodeveloped short-term serious outcomes and might have reducedadmissions by 10%.
How this might change clinical practice 
This clinical decision rule requires validation before emergencyphysicians should use it. If validated, such a rule could be usefulin reducing inpatient admission and allowing safe outpatientevaluation of syncope.

226 ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE 43:2 FEBRUARY 2004if they were discharged were also considered to havehad a serious outcome. An acute intervention was anyprocedure required to treat a condition related to thepatient’s symptom of syncope, which included pace-maker insertion, surgery for valvular heart disease, bal-loon pump insertion, use of vasopressors, surgery totreat an abdominal aortic aneurysm, surgery for rup-tured spleen, surgery for ruptured ectopic pregnancy ,and endoscopic treatment of esophageal varices.Monitoring of patients, medication changes, and intra-venous therapy for medications or rehydration were notconsidered acute interventions. 
A trained research nurse and the principal investiga-
tor independently reviewed outcomes by using explicitcriteria. Disagreements were discussed, and consensuswas obtained. Both reviewers were blinded to the pre-dictor variables when making their determination of aserious outcome. Day 7 outcomes were uniformlydetermined and reported, with patients having follow-up at different points according to their availability forfollow-up and completion of investigations. Follow-upwas completed by review of inpatient records, discus-sion with their primary physicians, or discussion withthe patients or family members. In circumstances inwhich patients could not be found or located on follow-up, death records and admissions to local hospitalswere checked.
Statistical Analysis
All predictor variables were analyzed with univari-
ate analysis with the r2test for categorical variables
and the Mann-Whitney rank sum test for continuousvariables. Variables subject to interpretation were ana-lyzed with gor weighted gstatistics to measure physi-
cian agreement.
23Variables  with  Pvalue  less than  .1
andggreater than 0.5 were analyzed with recursive
partitioning techniques to develop a model that wouldmaximize the prediction of serious outcomes. Theobjective was to find the best combination of predictorvariables (ie, those highly sensitive for detecting theoutcome while achieving the maximal specificity).Recursive partitioning was performed with Knowl-edgeSEEKER software (KnowledgeStudio, version 3.1;Angoss Software International, Toronto, Ontario,Canada) by using variables with the strongest associa-tion with serious outcomes (highest r
2values), with
0.05 as the basis of partitioning, and by using signifi-cant manual override to allow for the selection of clini-cally  appropriate  variables.
24Our experience  sug-
gested that recursive partitioning was more suitableand efficient than automated models such as logisticmost important from a review of the literature and a con-sensus of experts. Where possible, 2 physicians (attend-ing physician and house staff) independently evaluatedpatients to measure agreement on subjective variablesrequiring interpretation. Only attending physicianassessments were used in the analysis and derivation ofthe model. After completing the data form, the physi-cians treated and admitted patients in their usual man-ner without any specific study intervention.
Outcome Measures and Assessment
We defined serious outcomes as death, myocardial
infarction, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, stroke,subarachnoid hemorrhage, significant hemorrhage, orany condition causing or likely to cause a return EDvisit and hospitalization for a related event. This defini-tion was purposely broad and inclusive and was estab-lished before the start of the study .
Outcomes were determined by using the following
definitions. Death was confirmed with findings in themedical record and death registry . The definition ofmyocardial infarction used in the study was any eleva-tion of troponin or ECG change with an accompanyingdiagnosis of myocardial infarction on the dischargediagnosis and confirmed by the cardiology serviceinvolved in the care. For an arrhythmia to be considereda serious outcome, it had to be captured on monitoringand thought to have had a temporal relationship to thesyncopal or near syncopal event. Pulmonary embolismwas determined by ventilation perfusion scanning,computed tomography (CT) of the chest, or angiogra-phy . It also had to be confirmed on discharge diagnosis,and the patient needed to have received treatment forthe pulmonary embolism or to have had it confirmed onautopsy . The diagnosis of stroke and subarachnoidhemorrhage was determined by discharge diagnosis,chart review to see whether the symptoms were tempo-rally related to the admission, and confirmation that theadmitting attending physician believed that the find-ings were thought to have been related or to have been acause of the syncopal event. Significant hemorrhagewas defined as any episode of syncope or near syncopeassociated with a source of bleeding that required trans-fusion. Any patients discharged from the ED or hospitalafter a syncopal event and then readmitted for the sameor similar symptoms related to the initial syncopalevent were considered to have had a serious outcome.Patients with related return visits who were not admit-ted were not considered to have had a serious outcome.Patients admitted who required an acute interventionduring their stay that would have caused them to return

The presence ofrales had reasonable agreement (0.48; 95% CI 0.30 to0.66), but new neurologic findings, abnormal CT find-ings, the presence of abnormal heart sounds, and thepresence of vagal symptoms (0.33; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.46)had only fair agreement. The physical finding of carotidbruits was rare, and its presence had poor agreement(0.01; 95% CI 0 to 0.2). 
Significant variables with good agreement were ana-
lyzed with multivariate models. Recursive partitioningtechniques produced a clinically acceptable model thatmaximized the prediction of serious outcomes. Theprediction variables in this model were combined into asimple algorithm, the San Francisco syncope rule. Thisclinical decision rule includes an abnormal ECG (notsinus rhythm or new changes compared with previousECG), complaint of shortness of breath, hematocrit lessthan 30%, a triage systolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg, and a history  of congestive  heart failu re (Table
4; Figu re).regression when the objective is to correctly classifyone outcome group at the expense of the other (ie,when high sensitivity is more important than overallaccuracy); it was thus used as the primary multivariatemethod of analysis. By using a simple normal approxi-mation method and assuming our serious outcome ratewould be 10%, we determined that 62 patients wouldbe required to have a 95% confidence interval (CI) witha total width of 15%.
RESULTS
Syncope visits represented 1.4% of the 58,884 ED visitsduring the study period from July 1, 2000, untilFebruary 28, 2002. Fifty-five percent of all patientswere admitted, 59% were women, and the average agewas 62 years. All patients had some form of follow-up:48% by medical record review , 37% with direct tele-phone follow-up, and 11% through telephone calls tothe patient’s physician; less than 4% required indirectfollow-up through checks to local hospitals and thedeath registry . Of the 684 patients evaluated by attend-ing physicians, 79 (11.5%) patients developed seriousoutcomes  by day 7 (Table 1). Of the 50 predictor  vari-
ables analyzed, 26 were significantly associated with aserious outcome by using a significance level of 0.1(Tables  2 and 3). 
Variables associated with organic heart disease were
all significant predictors of a serious outcome. Thesevariables included increased age, a complaint of chestpain, and a history of coronary artery disease, arrhyth-mia, diabetes, or congestive heart failure. Physical find-ings such as rales, abnormal heart sounds, and either asystolic or diastolic murmur were also significantlyassociated with serious outcomes, as were the findingsof a non–sinus rhythm or abnormal ECG (an ECG withnew changes).
The use of anti-arrhythmic medications and diuret-
ics was significantly associated with serious outcomes.No other cardiac medications were significantly associ-ated with a serious outcome, except for nitrates. In thiscase, the use of nitrates was found in a greater propor-tion of patients who had a nonserious outcome, whichwas also the case for vagal symptoms, also more com-mon in patients without serious outcomes. 
T wo physicians evaluated 265 patients indepen-
dently , and agreement was calculated on variables sub-ject to interpretation. Variables with significant agree-ment (g>0.5) were the presence of new changes on ECG
(0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.77) and ECG rhythm interpreta-tion (0.56; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67). The presence of a mur-

although desirable, would be an unrealistic goal for asymptom with diverse causes that is only occasionallydiagnosed. However, we do think that this highly sensi-tive and specific derived rule may play an importantrole in physician decisionmaking and has benefits overunstructu red physician  judgment.
33Without  100%
sensitivity , this rule should be viewed by physicians as arisk stratification tool to help with decisionmaking asopposed to a rule to replace judgment. Because of thelimitations outlined here, physicians should wait forApplying the rule to this derivation set of patients
would result in a sensitivity (for identifying 79 caseswith serious outcomes) of 96.2% (95% CI 92% to 100%)and a specificity of 61.9% (95% CI 58% to 66%). Weestimated that the rule would place 45% of patients athigh risk, suggesting the need for admission, a potential10% absolute reduction in the admission rate of 55%found in this cohort.

FEBRUARY 2004 43:2 ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE 229that rare serious outcomes not in our derivation setwould make validating any rule with 100% sensitivityand certainty almost impossible. We thus accepted arule that maximized sensitivity and specificity at theexpense of not achieving 100% sensitivity .
In most situations, clinical decision rules have been
developed in which the outcome measure is discrete,clearly defined, and easily measured, such as fractureversus no fracture on radiograph. For syncope, deter-mining and defining an outcome for a symptom that isoften not diagnosed and whose causes are so diversewas a challenging and important part of this study . Thisproblem was addressed before the start of our study bycreating a definition of a serious outcome that woulddefine outcomes that most people would agree wereserious and would require acute evaluation or treat-ment should they have occurred by day 7. The outcomemeasure in this study was achieved through a consen-sus of experts, and we purposely made the outcomebroad and inclusive to try to include all possible seriousoutcomes.
The use of this broad inclusive composite outcome
does lead to further limitations. Most important, byusing a composite outcome the rule may not accuratelypredict outcomes represented by just a few cases or bypotentially rare cases not even present in this cohort.For example, in our study we had only 6 serious neuro-logic outcomes and 1 ectopic pregnancy that wereexplained by the rule. Unlike cardiac outcomes, whichwere the majority in this study , these outcomes willrequire much larger numbers of patients in validationstudies to determine whether the rule really fits theseconditions, which may cause our sensitivity to be lowerthan reported in this study . However, many underrepre-sented outcomes usually do not present solely as syn-cope and have other presentations with definitive andalternative means of testing and diagnosis available (eg,subarachnoid hemorrhage). Tests for some of theseconditions have been shown to be of limited value inassessing  all patients  with  syncope
17(eg, CT scanning).
The seriousness of the 3 outcomes not predicted by
our rule and predicted only by a nonspecific age crite-rion can be debated. Of these 3 patients, 2 had small tro-ponin elevations less than 2 µg/L, with normal ECG
results, and 1 of these 2 patients had a negative cardiaccatheterization result. Although they were considerednon–Q wave myocardial infarctions by the physicianscaring for the patients, the seriousness of the isolatedtroponin  elevations  can be questioned.
34Our broad
definition of myocardial infarction and our focus onvalidation studies before implementing the rule in theirclinical practice. 
When developing any prediction rule, one could
always achieve 100% sensitivity , but often at theexpense of specificity and overfitting of the statisticalmodel. For example, in this model we could haveachieved 100% sensitivity by adding age older than 75years to the rule, which would have identified the 3patients not predicted by the rule. In this scenario,specificity would have dropped to 44% because 108patients without serious outcomes would have beenclassified as high risk. We thought that the tradeoff wassuboptimal because the absolute admission rate forpatients deemed to be high risk would be the same as, ifnot slightly higher than, baseline. We were also aware

13-15; howeve r, even  the most
rigorous strategies still result in the majority of patientshaving unclear causes for their loss of conscious-ness.
13,15,4 5Multiple  studies  have  shown  that the 1-year
mortality rates for patients with unknown cause of syn-cope are 4% to 6%, and rates for high-risk patients are ashigh as 30%.
16,17,19,4 5Kapoor  and Hanusa46also
showed  that syncope  itself  is not an independent  risk fac-
tor for increased overall mortality , cardiac mortality , orcardiovascular events. What is clear is that underlyingheart disease is a risk factor for mortality , regardless ofwhether the patient had a syncopal episode. It could beargued that all patients with syncope and cardiac risk fac-tors need further evaluation beyond the ED and thatadmission should be recommended for patients whosesyncope is believed to be a symptom of active cardiac dis-ease.
11,13-1 5This is often  unclea r, and it is also evident
that there are other noncardiac causes of syncope thatrequire immediate  attention.
47Leading  expe rts have
concurred that recommendations for hospital admissionshould be based on the potential for adverse outcomes ifthe evaluation is delayed, but they concluded that nostudies  have  directly  addressed  this question .
11,14
To answer this question, instead of focusing on long-
term outcomes and diagnoses, we focused on 7-day out-comes to achieve our goals, our rationale being that if aserious outcome happened 7 days after an initial EDvisit, it would be hard to justify that an emergencyadmission 7 days earlier was the only way to diagnoseand treat that patient. Although some may argue that anacute admission could be warranted for diagnosing aserious condition that could present as a serious out-come in 14 days, 1 month, or even a year, that rationaleassumes that important diagnoses can be made only forinpatients and that outpatient follow-up is inefficientor unavailable. Furthermore, researchers choosing tovalidate our rule should be careful to choose their out-come measures, should they attempt to validate the rulefor other than short-term outcomes. Outcomes in ourstudy were picked as important outcomes by day 7because we believed that they would justify an admis-sion. Using the same outcomes at 1 year or even amonth would not be appropriate. For example, in thisstudy 3 patients had pacemakers placed after outpatientevaluation between days 14 and 30 and by our day 7study definition had serious outcomes. T wo of thesepatients had uneventful 1-day admissions after their ini-short-term outcomes also explains the proportionallyhigh rate of acute myocardial infarctions in this cohortcompa red with  studies  with  long-term  follow-up.
18A
third patient was a patient readmitted for syncopewithin a week of her initial visit, without a cause found.All these patients are alive at 1 year without any relatedmorbidity . Physicians should draw their own conclu-sions about these patients that the rule did not correctlyclassify and should be aware of important limitationsintroduced into the study by using such a broad and all-encompassing outcome definition. 
Finally , we purposely did not develop the rule with
the physician’s decision to admit as the primary out-come. Thus, this rule is not a decision rule to predictadmission. The reasons to admit often take other fac-tors (eg, social factors) into consideration that,although important, we believed were not specific towhether patients with syncope are at acute risk for seri-ous outcomes that require acute hospitalization.
DISCUSSION
Despite the noted limitations, to our knowledge this isone of the largest prospective cohort studies of syncopepatients reported and the only attempt to derive a clini-cal decision rule to identify patients at risk for short-term serious outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy andreliability of 50 predictor variables used in the evalua-tion of patients with syncope and developed a highlysensitive clinical decision rule that we believe will aug-ment physician judgment and allow physicians torationally decide which patients with syncope needadmission according to their risk for short-term seriousoutcomes. The rule is not complex and is easily remem-bered by a simple mnemonic, CHESS (history of Con-gestive heart failure, Hematocrit <30%, abnormal ECG,a patient complaint of Shortness of breath, and a triageSystolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg). The San FranciscoSyncope Rule was derived according to strict method-ologic standards and provides tight CIs around the esti-mated sensitivities and specificities for determiningpatients  at risk.
35,36Further work  will evaluate  the rule
for accuracy and reliability , acceptability to clinicians,actual effect on patient care, and cost-effectiveness. 
Others agree with us that the current use of hospital-
ization for patients with syncope is inefficient andhighly variable and that there is a need for a more cost-effective  approach.

Reporting day 30 outcomes with our defined out-come measures would have been inappropriate for thesecases for the purposes of helping with acute admissiondecisions because it could be argued that not admittingthese patients would have been the right decision andthe rule correctly classified these patients. Investigatorsinterested in the performance of the rule in predictinglong-term outcomes should pick more appropriate well-defined long-term outcomes such as mortality .
This large prospective cohort study has shown that
many variables are associated with serious outcomes inpatients with syncope. In this derivation set, our deci-sion rule was 96% sensitive and 62% specific for predict-ing acute day 7 serious outcomes. The rule emphasizesthe importance of the ECG and a history of congestiveheart failure that have also been important predictors of1-year mortality and surrogates for organic heart diseaseon other  multivariate  analysis.
19,20,4 8Our derived  deci-
sion rule now needs to be prospectively validated on alarge cohort of patients before physicians consider intro-ducing it into clinical practice.
