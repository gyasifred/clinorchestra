- xvii - Executive summary 
In 1993 the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook a comprehensive review of the uses and 
interpretation of anthropometric references. The review concluded that the NCHS/WHO growth 
reference, which had been recommended for international use since the late 1970s, did not adequately 
represent early childhood growth and that new growth curves were necessary. The World Health Assembly endorsed this recommendation in 1994. In response WHO undertook the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) between 1997 and 2003  to generate new curves for assessing the 
growth and development of children the world over.  
The MGRS combined a longitudinal follow-up from birth to 24 months and a cross-sectional survey of 
children aged 18 to 71 months. Primary growth data and related information were gathered from 8440 healthy breastfed infants and young children from widely diverse ethnic backgrounds and cultural 
settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and USA). The MGRS is unique in that it was 
purposely designed to produce a standard by selecting healthy children living under conditions likely to favour the achievement of their full genetic growth potential. Furthermore, the mothers of the children selected for the construction of the standards engaged in fundamental health-promoting 
practices, namely breastfeeding and not smoking.  
This report presents the first set of WHO Child Growth Standards (i.e. length/height-for-age, weight-
for-age, weight-for-length, weight-for-height and body mass index (BMI)-for-age) and describes the methodical process followed in their development. The first step in this process was a consultative 
expert review of some 30 growth curve construction methods, including types of distributions and 
smoothing techniques to identify the best approach to constructing the standards. Next was the selection of a software package flexible enough to allow the comparative testing of the alternative methods used to generate the growth curves. Then the selected approach was applied systematically to search for the best models to fit the data for each indicator.  
The Box-Cox-power-exponential (BCPE) method, with curve smoothing by cubic splines was selected 
for constructing the WHO child growth curves. The BCPE accommodates various kinds of distributions, from normal to skewed or kurtotic. The age-based indicators originating at birth required a power-transformation to stretch the age scale (x-axis) as a preliminary step to fitting the curves. For 
each set of curves, the search for the best model specification began by examining various 
combinations of degrees of freedom to fit the median and variance estimator curves. When data had a non-normal distribution, degrees of freedom for parameters to model skewness and kurtosis were added to the initial model and adequacy of fit evaluated. Apart from length/height-for-age, which 
followed a normal distribution, the other standards required the modelling of skewness, but not 
kurtosis. The diagnostic tools used iteratively to detect possible model misfits and biases in the fitted curves included various tests of local and global goodness of fit, worm plots and residual plots. Patterns of differences between empirical and fitted percentiles were also examined, as were 
proportions of observed versus expected percentages of children with measurements below selected 
percentiles.  
The methodology described above was followed to generate /g326 for boys and girls aged 0 to 60 months 
/g326 percentile and z-score curves for length/height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, weight-
for-height and BMI-for-age. The last standard is an addition to the set of indicators previously 
available as part of the NCHS/WHO reference. In-depth descriptions are presented of how each sex-specific standard was constructed. Also presented are comparisons of the new WHO standards with the NCHS/WHO growth reference and the CDC 2000 growth charts.  
To interpret differences between the WHO standards and the NCHS/WHO reference it is important to 
understand that they reflect differences not only in the populations used, but also in the methodologies applied to construct the two sets of growth curves. To address the significant skewness of the NCHS/WHO sample's weight-for-age and weight-for-height, separate standard deviations were 
xviiicalculated for distributions below and above the median for each of the two indicators. This approach 
is limited in fitting skewed data, especially at the extreme tails of the distribution, since it only partially adjusts for the skewness inherent in the weight-based indicators. The WHO standards, on the other hand, employed LMS-based methods that fit skewed data adequately and generate fitted curves that follow closely the empirical data. Like the WHO standards, construction of the CDC 2000 growth 
charts was also based on the LMS method and, therefore, differences between this reference and the 
WHO standards are largely a reflection of differences in the populations on which the two sets of 
curves were based. 
Length/height-for-age. The standard for linear growth has a part based on length (length-for-age, 0 to 
24 months) and another on height (height-for-age, 2 to 5 years). The two parts were constructed using 
the same model but the final curves reflect the average difference between recumbent length and standing height. By design, children between 18 and 30 months in the cross-sectional component of the MGRS had both length and height measurements taken. The average difference between the two 
measurements in this set of 1625 children was 0.73 cm. To fit a single model for the whole age range, 
0.7 cm was therefore added to the cross-sectional height values before merging them with the longitudinal sample's length data. After the model was fitted, the median curve was shifted back downwards by 0.7 cm for ages above two years, and the coefficient of variation curve adjusted to the 
new median values to construct the height-for-age growth curves. The same power transformation of 
age was applied to stretch the age scale for each of the sexes before fitting cubic splines to generate their respective growth curves. The boys' curves required a model with higher degrees of freedom to fit both the median and coefficient of variation curves. The data for both sexes followed the normal distribution. 
Weight-for-age. The weights of the longitudinal and cross-sectional samples were merged without any 
adjustments and a single model was fitted to generate one continuous set of curves constituting each sex-specific weight-for-age standard. The same power transformation was applied to both boys' and girls' age before fitting the curve construction model. The weight data for both sexes were skewed, so 
in specifying the model, the parameter related to skewness was fitted in addition to the median and the 
approximate coefficient of variation. In modelling skewness the girls' curves required more degrees of freedom to fit a curve for this parameter. 
Weight-for-length/height. The construction of the weight-for-length (45 to 110 cm) and weight-for-
height (65 to 120 cm) standards followed a procedure similar to that applied to construct the 
length/height-for-age standards. That is, to fit a single model, 0.7 cm was added to the cross-sectional height values, and after the model was fitted, the weight-for-length centile curves in the length interval 65.7 to 120.7 cm were shifted back by 0.7 cm to derive the weight-for-height standards corresponding 
to the height range 65 cm to 120 cm. The lower limit of the weight-for-length standards (45 cm) was 
chosen to cover up to approximately -2 SD girls' length at birth. The upper limit for the weight-for-height standards was influenced by the need to accommodate the tallest children at age 60 months, that is, 120 cm is approximately +2 SD boys' height-for-age at 60 months. The overlap between the upper 
end of the weight-for-length standards and the lower end of the weight-for-height standards is intended 
to facilitate their application in severely undernourished populations and emergency settings.  
There was no evidence that a length/height transformation similar to that described for age was 
required for constructing the weight-for-length/height standards. The modelling of the median and 
variance curves followed the procedure described for the first two standards. Results from the final 
model for girls' weight-for-length/height suggested the need to investigate potential improvements in the curves by modelling kurtosis. Adjustment for kurtosis, however had a negligible impact on the final centiles. Therefore, considering that modelling the fourth parameter would increase complexity 
in application of the standards and create inconsistency between the sexes, the final curves were 
generated without adjusting for kurtosis. The degrees of freedom for the median and variance curves varied between the boys' and girls' standards. The fact that the weight-for-length/height indicator combines different velocities for the two measurements involved (weight and length/height) at 
- xix - overlapping ages likely explains the slight wiggle in the final WHO standards (for both boys and girls) 
as also observed in other references. 
Body mass index-for-age. Body mass index is the ratio weight (in kg) /recumbent length or standing 
height (in m2). To address the difference between length and height, the approach used for constructing 
the BMI-for-age standards was different from that described for length/height-for-age. Because BMI is 
a ratio with squared length or height in the denominator, adding 0.7 cm to the height values and back-transforming them after fitting was not feasible. The solution adopted was to construct the standards for the younger and the older children separately based on two sets of data with an overlapping range of ages below and above 24 months. To construct the BMI-for-age standard based on length 
(0 to 2 years), the longitudinal sample's length data and the cross-sectional sample's height data 
(18 to 30 months) were combined after adding 0.7 cm to the height values. Analogously, to construct the standard from 2 to 5 years, the cross-sectional sample's height plus the longitudinal sample's length data (18 to 24 months) were combined after subtracting 0.7 cm from the length values. Thus, a 
common set of data from 18 to 30 months was used to generate the BMI standards for the younger and 
the older children. The resulting disjunction between the two standards thus in essence reflects the 0.7 cm difference between length and height. This does not mean, however, that a child at a specific age will have the same length- and height-based BMI-for-age z-score as this is mathematically 
impossible given the nature of the BMI ratio.  
An age power transformation as described for the  other age-based standards was required before 
constructing the length-based BMI-for-age curves. No such transformation was necessary for the height-based BMI-for-age. The WHO length- and height-based BMI-for-age standards do not overlap, 
i.e. the length-based interval ends at 730 days and the height-based interval starts at 731 days. Cubic 
spline fitting was achieved with variable degrees of freedom for the length- versus height-based standards, and also for the boys' versus girls' final curves.  
Technical aspects of the standards. The method used to construct the WHO standards generally relied 
on the Box-Cox power exponential distribution and the final selected models simplified to the LMS 
model. As a result, the computation of percentiles and z-scores for these standards uses formulae based on the LMS method. However, a restriction was imposed on all indicators to enable the derivation of percentiles only within the interval corresponding to z-scores between -3 and 3. The underlying reasoning is that percentiles beyond ±3 SD are invariant to changes in equivalent z-scores. 
The loss accruing to this restriction is small since the inclusion range corresponds to the 0.135th to 
99.865th percentiles. 
The weight-based indicators presented right-skewed distributions. When modelled correctly, right 
skewness has the effect of making distances between positive z-scores increase progressively the 
farther away they are from the median, while distances between negative z-scores decrease 
progressively. The LMS method fits skewed data adequately by using a Box-Cox normal distribution, which follows the empirical data closely. The drawback, however, is that the outer tails of the distribution are highly affected by extreme data points even if only very few. A restricted application 
of the LMS method was thus used for the construction of the WHO weight-based indicators, limiting 
the Box-Cox normal distribution to the interval corresponding to z-scores where empirical data were available (i.e. between -3 SD and 3 SD). Beyond these limits, the standard deviation at each age (or length/height) was fixed to the distance between ±2 SD and ±3 SD, respectively. This approach avoids 
making assumptions about the distribution of data beyond the limits of the observed values. 
Epidemiological aspects of the standards. As expected, there are notable differences with the 
NCHS/WHO reference that vary by age, sex, anthropometric measure and specific percentile or  z-score curve. Differences are particularly important in infancy. Stunting will be greater throughout 
childhood when assessed using the new WHO st andards compared to the NCHS/WHO reference. The 
growth pattern of breastfed infants will result in a substantial increase in rates of underweight during the first half of infancy and a decrease thereafter. For wasting, the main difference is during infancy 
xxwhen wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect to 
overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, sex and nutritional status of the index population.  
The growth standards presented in this report provide a technically robust tool that represents the best 
description of physiological growth for children under five years of age. The standards depict normal 
early childhood growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be used to assess children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding. 
- 1 - 1. INTRODUCTION 
Growth charts are an essential component of the paediatric toolkit. Their value resides in helping to 
determine the degree to which physiological needs for growth and development are met during the 
important childhood period. Beyond their usefulness in assessing children's nutritional status, many 
governmental and United Nations agencies rely on growth charts to measure the general well-being of populations, formulate health and related policies, and plan interventions and monitor their effectiveness.   
The origin of the WHO Child Growth Standards dates back to the early 1990s when a group of experts 
was appointed to conduct a meticulous evaluation of the National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization (NCHS/WHO) growth reference that had been recommended for international use since the late 1970s (WHO, 1995). The limitations of the NCHS/WHO reference have been 
documented (WHO Working Group on Infant Growth, 1994; de Onis and Yip, 1996; de Onis and 
Habicht, 1996). The data used to construct the reference covering birth to three years of age came from 
a longitudinal study of children of European ancestry from a single community in the USA. These children were measured every three months, which is inadequate to describe the rapid and changing 
rate of growth in early infancy. Also, the statistical methods available at the time the NCHS/WHO 
growth curves were constructed were too limited to correctly model the pattern and variability of growth. As a result, the NCHS/WHO curves do not adequately represent early childhood growth. 
The initial phase of the expert group's work documented the deficiencies of the reference and led to a 
plan for developing new growth charts that would show how children should  grow in all countries 
rather than merely describing  how  they grew at a particular time and place. The experts underscored 
the importance of ensuring that the new growth charts were consistent with "best" health practices (Garza and de Onis, 2004).  
A logical outcome of this plan was the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), which 
was implemented between 1997 and 2003 (de Onis et al., 2004a). The MGRS is unique in that it was purposely designed to produce a standard rather than a reference.  Although standards and references 
both serve as a basis for comparison, each enables a different interpretation. Since a standard defines how children should grow, deviations from the pattern it describes are evidence of abnormal growth. 
A reference, on the other hand, does not provide as sound a basis for such value judgments, although 
in practice references often are mistakenly used as standards.  
The MGRS data provide a solid foundation for developing a standard because they are based on 
healthy children living under conditions likely to favour achievement of their full genetic growth 
potential. Furthermore, the mothers of the children selected for the construction of the standards engaged in fundamental health-promoting practices, namely breastfeeding and not smoking (de Onis et al., 2004b).  
A second feature of the study that makes it attractive as a basis for an internationally applicable 
standard is that it included children from a divers e set of countries: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, 
Oman and the USA. By selecting privileged, healthy populations the study reduced the impact of environmental variation. Assessment of differences in linear growth among the child populations of the MGRS shows a striking similarity among the six sites, with only about 3% of variability in length 
being due to differences among sites compared to 70% due to differences among individuals (WHO 
Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006a). Thus, excluding any site has little effect on the 3rd, 50th, and 97th percentile values, and pooling data from all sites is entirely justified. The remarkable similarity in growth during early childhood across human populations is consistent with 
genomic comparisons among diverse continental groups reporting a high degree of inter-population 
homogeneity (Rosenberg, 2002; King and Motulsky, 2002; Jorde and Wooding, 2004). Nevertheless, the MGRS sample has considerable built-in ethnic or genetic variability in addition to cultural variation in how children are nurtured, which further strengthens the standards' universal applicability.  
2 Introduction 
A key characteristic of the new standards is that they explicitly identify breastfeeding as the biological 
norm and establish the breastfed child as the normative model for growth and development (WHO 
Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006b). Another distinguishing feature of the new 
standards is that they include windows of achievement for six gross motor developmental milestones which are presented elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006c). Although WHO in the past issued recommendations concerning attained physical growth, it had not previously 
made any recommendations for assessing motor development.  
This report presents the first set of WHO Child Growth Standards and describes the methods used to 
construct the standards for length/height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for length, weight-for-height and BMI-for-age. It also compares the new standards with the NCHS/WHO growth reference (WHO, 
1983) and the 2000 CDC growth charts (Kuczmarski, 2002). Electronic copies of the WHO growth 
charts and tables together with tools developed to facilitate their use are available on the Web:

- 3 - 2. METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Design of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study 
The MGRS (July 1997–December 2003) was a population-based study that took place in the cities of 
Davis, California, USA; Muscat, Oman; Oslo, Norway; and Pelotas, Brazil; and in selected affluent neighbourhoods of Accra, Ghana and South Delhi, India. The MGRS protocol and its implementation in the six sites are described in detail elsewhere (de Onis et al., 2004a). Briefly, the MGRS combined a 
longitudinal component from birth to 24 months with a cross-sectional component of children aged 
18–71 months. In the longitudinal component, mothers and newborns were screened and enrolled at birth and visited at home a total of 21 times on weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6; monthly from 2–12 months; and 
bimonthly in the second year. In the cross-sectional component, children aged 18–71 months were 
measured once, except in the two sites (Brazil and USA) that used a mixed-longitudinal design in which some children were measured two or three times at three-month intervals. Both recumbent 
length and standing height were measured for all children aged 18–30 months. Data were collected on 
anthropometry, motor development, feeding practices, child morbidity, perinatal factors, and socioeconomic, demographic and environmental characteristics (de Onis et al., 2004b). 
The study populations lived in socioeconomic conditions favourable to growth and where mobility 
was low, ≥20% of mothers followed WHO feeding recommendations and breastfeeding support was 
available (de Onis et al., 2004b). Individual inclusion criteria were: no known health or environmental 
constraints to growth, mothers willing to follow MGRS feeding recommendations (i.e. exclusive or 
predominant breastfeeding for at least 4 months, introduction of complementary foods by the age of 6 months, and continued partial breastfeeding up to at least 12 months), no maternal smoking before 
and after delivery, single term birth, and absence of significant morbidity (de Onis et al., 2004b).   
As part of the site-selection process in Ghana, India and Oman, surveys were conducted to identify 
socioeconomic characteristics that could be used to select groups whose growth was not 
environmentally constrained (Owusu et al., 2004; Bhandari et al., 2002; Mohamed et al., 2004). Local criteria for screening newborns, based on parental education and/or income levels, were developed from those surveys. Pre-existing survey data for this purpose were available from Brazil, Norway and 
the USA. Of the 13 741 mother-infant pairs screened for the longitudinal component, about 83% were 
ineligible (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006d). Families’ low socioeconomic status was the most common reason for ineligibility in Brazil, Ghana, India and Oman, whereas 
parental refusal was the main reason for non-participation in Norway and USA (WHO Multicentre 
Growth Reference Study Group, 2006d). For the cross-sectional component, 69% of the 21 510 subjects screened were excluded for reasons similar to those observed in the longitudinal component.  
Term low-birth-weight (<2500 g) infants (2.3%) were not excluded. Since it is likely that in well-off 
populations such infants represent small but normal children, their exclusion would have artificially distorted the standards’ lower percentiles. Eligibility criteria for the cross-sectional component were 
the same as those for the longitudinal component with the exception of infant feeding practices. A 
minimum of three months of any breastfeeding was required for participants in the study’s cross-
sectional component.  
2.2 Anthropometry methods 
Data collection teams were trained at each site during the study's preparatory phase, at which time 
measurement techniques were standardized against one of two MGRS anthropometry experts. During 
the study, bimonthly standardization sessions were conducted at each site. Once a year the anthropometry expert visited each site to participate in these sessions (de Onis et al., 2004c). Results from the anthropometry standardization sessions  have been reported elsewhere (WHO Multicentre 
Growth Reference Study Group, 2006e). For the longitudinal component of the study, screening teams 
measured newborns within 24 hours of delivery, and follow-up teams conducted home visits until 24 months of age. The follow-up teams were also responsible for taking measurements in the cross-sectional component involving children aged 18–71 months (de Onis et al., 2004b). 
4 Methodology 
The MGRS data included weight and head circumference at all ages, recumbent length (longitudinal 
component), height (cross-sectional component), and arm circumference, triceps and subscapular 
skinfolds (all children aged /g1493 months). However, this report presents only the standards based on 
length or height and weight. Observers working in pairs collected anthropometric data. Each observer independently measured and recorded a complete set of measurements, after which the two compared their readings. If any pair of readings exceeded the maximum allowable difference for a given variable 
(e.g. weight, 100 g; length/height, 7 mm), both observers once again independently measured and 
recorded a second and, if necessary, a third set of readings for the variable(s) in question (de Onis et 
al., 2004c).  
All study sites used identical measuring equipment. Instruments needed to be highly accurate and 
precise, yet sturdy and portable to enable them to be carried back and forth on home visits. Length was measured with the portable Harpenden Infantometer (range 30–110 cm, with digit counter readings precise to 1 mm). The Harpenden Portable Stadiometer (range 65–206 cm, digit counter reading) was 
used for measuring adult and child heights. Portable electronic scales with a taring capability, 
calibrated to 0.1 kg (i.e. UNICEF Electronic Scale 890 or UNISCALE), were used to measure weight. Length and height were recorded to the last completed unit rather than to the nearest unit. To correct for the systematic negative bias introduced by this practice, 0.05 cm (i.e. half of the smallest 
measurement unit) was added to each measurement before analysis. This correction did not apply to 
weight, which was rounded off to the nearest 100 g. Full details of the instruments used and how 
measurements were taken are provided elsewhere (de Onis et al., 2004c).  
2.3 Sample description 
The total sample size for the longitudinal and cross-sectional components from all six sites was 
8440 children. A total of 1743 children were enrolled in the longitudinal sample, six of whom were excluded for morbidities affecting growth (4 cases of repeated episodes of diarrhoea, 1 case of 
repeated episodes of malaria, and 1 case of protein-energy malnutrition) leaving a sample of 
1737 children (894 boys and 843 girls). Of these, the mothers of 882 children (428 boys and 454 girls) complied fully with the MGRS infant-feeding and no-smoking criteria and completed the follow-up period of 24 months (96% of compliant children completed the 24-month follow-up) (Table 1). The other 855 children contributed only birth measurements, as they either failed to comply with the 
study's infant-feeding and no-smoking criteria or dropped out before 24 months. The reason for using 
these measurements was to increase the sample size at birth to minimize the left-edge effect. The size at birth of these 855 children was similar to that of the compliant sample (Table 2). The total number of records for the longitudinal component was 19 900.

The cross-sectional sample comprised 6697 children. Of these, 28 were excluded for medical 
conditions affecting growth (20 cases of protein-energy malnutrition, five cases of haemolytic anaemia 
G6PD deficiency, two cases of renal tubulo-interstitial disease, and one case of Crohn disease) leaving a final sample of 6669 children (3450 boys and 3219 girls) (Table 3). The total number of records in the cross-sectional component was 8306 as some children in Brazil and the USA were measured two 
or three times at three-month intervals (Table 4). A full description of the MGRS sample with regard 
to screening, recruitment, sample attrition and compliance, as well as the baseline characteristics of the study sample is provided elsewhere (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006d).

2.4 Data cleaning procedures and exclusions 
Data cleaning 
The MGRS data management protocol (Onyango et al., 2004) was designed to create and manage a 
large databank of information collected from multiple sites over a period of several years. Data collection and processing instruments were prepared centrally and used in a standardized fashion 
across sites. The data management system contained internal validation features for timely detection of 
data errors and its standard operating procedures stipulated a method of master file updating and correction that maintained a clear trail for data-auditing purposes. Each site was responsible for collecting, entering, verifying and validating data, and for creating site-level master files. Data from 
6 Methodology 
the sites were sent to WHO/HQ every month for master file consolidation and more extensive quality 
control checking. All errors identified were communicated to the site for correction at source. 
After data collection was completed at a given site, a period of about 6 months was dedicated to in-
depth data quality checking and master file cleaning. Detailed validation reports, descriptive statistics and plots were produced from the site’s master files. For the longitudinal component, each anthropometric measurement was plotted for every child from birth to the end of his/her participation. 
These plots were examined individually for any questionable patterns. Query lists from these analyses 
were sent to the site for investigation and correction, or confirmation, as required. As with the data collection process, the site data manager prepared correction batches to update the master files. The updated master files were then sent to WHO/HQ and this iterative quality assurance process continued 
until all identifiable problems had been detected and corrected. The rigorous implementation of what 
was a highly demanding protocol yielded very high-quality data. 
Data exclusions To avoid the influence of unhealthy weights for length/height, observations falling above +3 SD and 
below -3 SD of the sample median were excluded prior to constructing the standards. For the cross-
sectional sample, the +2 SD cut-off (i.e. 97.7 percentile) was applied instead of +3 SD as the sample was exceedingly skewed to the right, indicating the need to identify and exclude high weights for height. This cut-off was considered to be conservative given that various definitions of overweight all 
apply lower cut-offs than the one used (Daniels et al., 2005; Koplan et al., 2005). 
To derive the above-mentioned cut-offs based on the sex-specific weight-for-length/height indicator, 
the weight median and coefficient of variation curves were modelled continuously across length/height using an approach that accounted for the sample's asymmetry as described below. The data were split 
into two sets: one set with all points above the median and another with all points below the median. 
For each of the two sets, mirror values were generated to create symmetrically distributed values around the median for the upper and lower sets. The generation of mirror data was necessary to simulate a symmetric distribution based on the distinct variabilities of the upper and lower sets. For 
each of the mirror data sets, median and coefficient of variation curves were estimated continuously 
across the length/height range using the LMS method (Cole and Green, 1992) fixing L=1, i.e. fitting a 
normal distribution to the data for each specific length/height value, to derive the corresponding cut-offs. In total, only a small proportion of observations were excluded for unhealthy weight-for-length/height: 185 (1.4%) for boys and 155 (1.1%) for gi rls, most of which were  in the upper end of 
the cross-sectional sample distribution (Table 5).

Methodology 7
In addition, a few influential observations for indicators other than weight-for-height were excluded 
when constructing the individua l standards: for weight-for-age boys, 4 (0.03%) and girls, 
1 (0.01%) observations and, for length/height-for-age boys, 3 (0.02%) and girls, 2 (0.01%) 
observations. These observations were set to missing in the final data set and therefore did not contribute to the construction of the weight-for-length/height and body mass index-for-age standards. The final number of observations used in the construction of the WHO child growth standards is 
shown in Table 6.

2.5 Statistical methods for constructing the growth curves 
The construction of the growth curves followed a careful, methodical process. This involved: 
 detailed examination of existing methods, including types of distributions and smoothing 
techniques, in order to identify the best possible approach;  
 selection of a software package flexible enough to allow comparative testing of alternative methods 
and the actual generation of the curves;  
 systematic application of the selected approach to the data to generate the models that best fit the 
data. 
A group of statisticians and growth experts met at WHO/HQ to review possible choices of methods 
and to define a strategy and criteria for selecting the most appropriate model for the MGRS data (Borghi et al., 2006). As many as 30 construction methods for attained growth curves were examined. The group recommended that methods based on selected distributions be compared and combined 
with two smoothing techniques for fitting parameter curves to further test and provide the best 
possible approach to constructing the WHO child growth standards. 
Choice of distribution . Five distributions were identified for detailed testing: Box-Cox power 
exponential (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2004a), Box-Cox t (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2004b), Box-
Cox normal (Cole and Green, 1992), Johnson's SU (Johnson, 1949), and modulus-exponential-normal 
(Royston and Wright, 1998). The first four distributions were fitted using GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape) software (Stasinopoulos et al., 2004) and the last using the "xriml" module in STATA software (Wright and Royston, 1996). The comparison was done 
by age group, without considering the smoothing component. The Box-Cox-power-exponential (BCPE) 
distribution with four parameters — µ (for the median), /g305 (coefficient of variation), /g542 (Box-Cox 
transformation power) and /g306 (parameter related to kurtosis) — was selected for constructing the curves. 
The BCPE is a flexible distribution that offers the possibility to adjust for kurtosis, thus providing the 
framework necessary to test if fitting the distribution's fourth moment improves the estimation of 
extreme percentiles. It simplifies to the normal distribution when /g542=1 and /g306=2, and when /g542/g1431 and /g306=2, 
the distribution is the same as the Box-Cox normal (LMS method's distribution). The BCPE is defined 
by a power transformation (or Box-Cox transformation) 
νY having a shifted and scaled (truncated) 
power exponential (or Box-Tiao) distribution with parameter /g306 (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2004a). 
8 Methodology 
Apart from other theoretical advantages, the BCPE presents as good or better goodness-of-fit than the 
modulus-exponential-normal or the SU distribution.  
Choice of smoothing technique . The expert group recommended two smoothing techniques for 
comparison: cubic splines and fractional polynomials (Borghi et al., 2006). Using the GAMLSS software, the two technique s were compared for smoothing length/height-for-age, weight-for-age and 
weight-for-length/height curves. For the fractional polynomials, a function in GAMLSS was used that 
estimates the best set of powers among {-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3} within the choices of polynomials 
with the same number of terms. The best fractional polynomial for 1, 2 or 3 terms was fitted for each parameter curve. A number of combinations were tried among the different parameter curves, considering the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974), AIC, defined as: 
,2 2 p L AIC + −=
where L is the maximized likelihood and p is the number of parameters (or the total number of degrees 
of freedom). According to this criterion, the best model is the one with the smallest AIC value.  
The cubic spline smoothing technique offered more flexibility than fractional polynomials in all cases. 
For the length/height-for-age and weight-for-age standards, a power transformation applied to age 
prior to fitting was necessary to enhance the goodness of fit by the cubic spline technique.  
Choice of method for constructing the curves . In summary, the BCPE method, with curve smoothing 
by cubic splines, was selected as the approach for constructing the growth curves. This method is included in a broader methodology, the GAMLSS (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2005), which offers a 
general framework that includes a wide range of known methods for constructing growth curves. The 
GAMLSS allows for modeling the mean (or median) of the growth variable under consideration as well as other parameters of its distribution that determine scale and shape. Various kinds of distributions can be assumed for each growth variable of interest, from normal to skewed and/or 
kurtotic distributions. Several smoothing terms can be used in generating the curves, including cubic 
splines, lowess  (locally weighted least squares regression), polynomials, power polynomials and 
fractional polynomials. The simplified notation to describe a particular model within the class of the BCPE method is:  
BCPE(x=x, df(µ)=n
1, df(/g305)=n 2, df(/g542)=n 3, df(/g306)=n 4),
where df(·) are the degrees of freedom for the cubic splines smoothing the respective 
parameter curve and x is age (or transformed age) or length/height. Note that when df(·)=1 ,
the smoothing function reduces to a constant and when df(·)=2 , it reduces to a linear function. 
The GAMLSS software was used to construct the WHO child growth standards. The main selected 
diagnostic tests and tools are available in this software. To complement and test the software, Dr Huiqi Pan and Professor Tim Cole provided the software LMS Pro, which offers the fitting of growth curves using the LMS method in a user-friendly and interactive way, including some of the available 
diagnostics for choosing the best set of degrees of freedom for the cubic splines and goodness-of-fit 
statistics. Wright and Royston's package "xriml", developed in the STATA environment, was used to test the fitting of fractional polynomials (Wright and Royston, 1996). 
Diagnostic tests and tools for selecting the best model. The process for selecting the best model to 
construct each growth standard involved choosing, first, the best model within  a class of models and, 
second, the best model across  different classes of models. The set of diagnostic tests and tools was 
selected based on recommendations from the statistical expert group (Borghi et al., 2006), with additional contributions by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2004a) and Pan and Cole (2004).  
Methodology 9
In most cases, before fitting the cubic splines, an age transformation was needed to stretch the age 
scale for values close to zero. Despite their complexity in terms of shape, even the flexible cubic 
splines fail to adequately fit early infancy growth with reasonable degrees of freedom. When the 
degrees of freedom are increased excessively, the function can fit well in infancy but it under-smoothes at older ages. The solution is to expand the age scale when growth velocity is high and to compress it when it is low (Cole et al., 1998). A power transformation applied to age, i.e. f(/g540)=age
/g540,
was a good solution for the considered cases. Therefore, prior to determining the best degrees of 
freedom for the parameter curves, a search was conducted for the best /g540 for the age power 
transformation. For this, an arbitrary starting model was used to search for the best age-transformation power ( /g540) based only on the global deviance values over a preset grid of /g540 values, since the degrees of 
freedom remained unchanged. The grid of /g540 values ranged from 0.05 to 1 in 0.05 intervals, with the 
exception of the BMI-for-age standards for children younger than 24 months, for which the value 0.01 
also was considered. No length/he ight transformation was necessary  for weight-for-length/height. 
(a) Selecting the best model within a class of models
Models were grouped in classes according to the parameters to be modelled. The alternative to 
modelling parameters was to fix them, e.g. /g542=1 or /g306=2. The criteria used to choose among models 
within the same class were the AIC and the generalized version of it with penalty equal to 3 ( GAIC(3) )
as defined in Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2004a): 
,3 2 )3( p L GAIC + −=
where L is the maximized likelihood and p is the number of parameters (or the total number of degrees 
of freedom). While the use of the AIC enhances the fitting of local trends, smoother curves are 
obtained when the model's choice is based on the GAIC(3)  criterion. Consistency in the use of these 
two criteria was attempted across all indicators. For selecting the best combination of df(µ) and df( /g305),
both criteria were used in parallel. In cases of disagreement, AIC was used to select df(µ) and GAIC(3)
to select df( /g305), overall favouring the options which offered a good compromise between keeping 
estimates close to the empirical values and producing smooth curves. Only GAIC(3)  values were 
examined to select df( /g542) and, whenever needed, df( /g306). In rare cases, other age-specific diagnostic tools 
were considered for selecting the model with an adequate number of degrees of freedom for the cubic 
splines fitting the parameter curves. Worm plots (van Buuren and Fredriks, 2001) and Q-test (Royston 
and Wright, 2000) were used conjointly for this purpose.  
Group-specific Q-test statistics resulting in absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 that were larger than 2 
were interpreted to indicate a misfit of, respectively, mean, variance, skewness or kurtosis. The overall 
Q-test statistics combining all groups were based on a Chi-square distribution, which assumes that 
observations from different groups are independent. In this case, however, given the repeated measurements in the longitudinal study component, the resulting test's p-values could be distorted slightly. To minimize this potential problem, age groups were designed to avoid repeated 
measurements of the same child within the same age group. The age groups were formed in time 
intervals (days) to achieve an approximately even sample size distribution across the entire age range of interest, especially in the cross-sectional component, where sample sizes are smaller than in the longitudinal data.  
For the longitudinal component, i.e. the first 24 months, time intervals were selected to preserve the 
longitudinal follow-up structure and avoid having multiple measurements of a given child within one age group. Note that for the longitudinal sample, age ranges were defined to correspond to specific visits, although visits did not always take place at the exact targeted age. For this reason, the constructed age group sample sizes were sometimes slightly different from the designed follow-up 
10 Methodology 
visit sample sizes. Moreover, cross-sectional observations were added to the longitudinal sample 
between 18 and 24 months. In the cross-sectional data, it is possible that in a few cases more than one 
measurement from the same child occurs because of the multiple visits in Brazil and the USA, 
combined with the lower data density in this component. Similarly, it was impossible to break the sample into independent groups for the weight-for-length/height indicators. For this reason, the Q-test results required a conservative interpretation. 
Overall, Q-test results were interpreted with caution and considered simultaneously with results of 
worm plots (van Buuren and Fredriks, 2001) which do not require any assumption and still offer very specific information about the goodness of fit for each group. The same age grouping was used as defined for the Q-test. Interpretation of results requires careful review of the shapes of the worms 
formed by a cubic polynomial (the red line in all worm plots) fitted to the points of the detrended Q-Q 
plots based on z-score values derived from the model being evaluated. A detrended Q-Q plot is presented for each age group. Confidence intervals (95%) are displayed for each of the worms (dotted curves in all worm plots). Table 7 summarizes the interpretation of various worm plot patterns. Flat worms indicate an adequate fit. The Q-test combined with the worm plot patterns provide a robust 
assessment of a model's goodness of fit, especially in terms of evaluating local fit.

Pan and Cole (2004) proposed using a new tool to guide the choice of degrees of freedom for cubic 
splines fitting each of the parameter curves. They suggested plotting standardized Q-statistics against the number of age groups minus the corresponding degrees of freedom, for each of the L, M and S curves of the LMS method (Cole and Green, 1992). If fitting is adequate, the Q-statistics should be 
normally distributed with values within the range -2 to 2. This tool provides a global rather than a 
local test of significance and gives an accurate impression of the underlying goodness of fit because it does not depend on the precise choice of the number of groups. The proposed test is very useful for cross-sectional data where the choice of the number of groups can affect the Q-test results considerably. For example, points that are close in age but in opposite tails of the distribution generate 
opposing skewness when they fall into separate groups but cancel each other out when they are in the 
same group. This test was not implemented for the MGRS sample for two reasons. First, the largest number of observations was obtained in the study's longitudinal component, i.e. data were collected frequently at relatively well-defined ages from birth to 24 months. Second, splitting age intervals in a 
manner that failed to follow the study design, e.g. from birth to one month (which includes 
Methodology 11
measurements taken at birth, and at 7, 14 and 28 days) would group together four measurements per 
child, thereby reducing the reliability of the Q-test results.  
(b) Selecting the best model across different classes of models
The search for the best model was done in an add-up stepwise form, starting from the simplest class of 
models comprising the age transformation, if any, and the fitting of the µ and /g305 curves, while keeping 
fixed /g542=1 and /g306=2 as described in section (a) above. The next step was to fit the /g542 curve, fixing only 
/g306=2 and using the df(µ) and df( /g305) selected in the previous step. Once the best model within this class 
of models was selected, Q-test and worm plot results were evaluated to inform the decision on whether or not to select the more complex model. In a few cases when Q-test and worm plots were not sufficient to assess the improvement offered by the more complex model, comparison of observed and 
fitted percentiles was used to determine if differences were of clinical significance.  
The fit of /g306 was considered only when Q-test or worm plots indicated misfit with respect to kurtosis. In 
this case, a third class of models was considered and comparison of observed against fitted percentiles was done to assess the improvement in the final curves. Among the rare cases where this occurred, 
fitting the fourth parameter always led to change that was negligible in practical terms. Therefore, all 
the models fitted had at most 3 non-fixed parameters (µ, /g305 and /g542).
With df( /g542) thus selected (i.e. when /g542 was not fixed to value 1), a new iteration was done to re-search 
for df(µ) and df( /g305). However, none of the additional iterations indicated any need to change either df(µ) 
or df( /g305). A further iteration was carried out to investigate if it was necessary to change the age-
transformation power /g540. This exercise did not lead to any changes in the selected models. 
The methodology described above was used for all the indicators. Methodological aspects that are 
specific to the construction of each of the standards are described hereafter in relevant sections. 
As part of the internal validation for each indicator, a detailed examination was made of the 
differences between empirical and the fitted centiles resulting from the selected model. Comparisons were also made between the observed and expected proportions of children with measurements below selected centiles across age (or length/height for weight-for-length/height) groups. For these two 
diagnostic tools, evidence of systematic patterns indicative of biases and the magnitude of deviations 
were examined.  
Length/height-for-age, weight-for-age and BMI-for age curves were constructed using all available 
data (i.e. from birth to 71 months) but final age-based standards were truncated at 60 completed 
months to avoid the right-edge effect (Borghi et al., 2006). The weight-for-length standards go from 
45 to 110 cm and weight-for-height from 65 to 120 cm. 
- 13 - 3. CONSTRUCTION OF THE LENG TH/HEIGHT-F OR-AGE  STANDARDS
3.1 Indicator-specific methodology 
For the linear growth indicator, the objective was to construct a length-for-age (birth to 2 years) and 
height-for-age (2 to 5 years) standard using the same model and yet reflect the average difference between recumbent length and standing height. By design, children between 18 and 30 months in the 
cross-sectional component had both length and height measurements taken. The average difference 
between the two measurements in this set of 1625 children was 0.73 cm. The results by age group are shown in Table 8. 
Table 8 Summary of differences between recumbent length and standing height in a sample of 
children measured both ways

St Deviation (cm)a0.61 0.67 0.61 0.61 0.62 
aRecumbent length minus standing height. 
To fit a single model for the whole age range, 0.7 cm was thus added to the cross-sectional height 
values. After the model was fitted, the median curve was shifted back downwards by 0.7 cm for ages 
above two years and the coefficient of variation curve adjusted to the new median values to construct the height-for-age growth curves. The adjusted coefficient of variation (S
*) was calculated as follows: 
* **
MS M
MStDevS×= = ,
where M and S are, respectively, the fitted median and coefficient of variation values, and M* are the 
shifted-down median values; StDev  is the standard deviation calculated as the median times the 
coefficient of variation. 
The curves were derived directly from a model that used cubic spline fitting functions for the median 
and coefficient of variation curves. The age transformation used to stretch the x-axis resulted in a large gap between the birth and day 14 measurements, and when the centiles were shrunk back to the original age scale, the cubic spline-fitted curves formed an artificial pattern in this interval. Therefore, 
keeping the cubic spline-fitted points at days 0 and 14, linear interpolation was applied to derive 
estimates of the median and the coefficient of variation curves from day 1 to 13 for the final standards. 
Although all available data (birth to 71 months) were used when modelling the curves, to minimize the 
right-edge effect the length/height-for-age and all the other age-based standards extend up to 
60 completed months only.

3.2.2 Model selection and results 
The model BCPE(x=age/g540, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=6, /g542=1,/g306=2) served as a starting point to construct the 
length-for-age growth curves. Improvement of the model's fit was investigated by studying changes in 
global deviance at varying levels of the age-transformation power /g540. Table 11 shows the global 
deviance for a grid of /g540 values. The smallest global deviance corresponds to age-transformation power 
/g540=0.35.

Having chosen the age-transformation power /g540=0.35, the search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) followed, 
comparing models in which the parameters /g542 and /g306 had the fixed values 1 and 2, respectively. For this, 
all possible combinations of df(µ) ranging from 5 to 15 and df( /g305) from 2 to 10 were considered. Partial 
results are presented in Table 12.

GD, Global Deviance; AIC, Akaike Information Criterion;

The best combination of AIC and GAIC(3)  corresponds to df(µ)=11 or 12 and df( /g305)=6. To select 
between df(µ)=11 and 12, their respective worm plots (Figures 1 and 5) were compared. Age group 
labels in the worm plots correspond to those shown in Table 14. The model df(µ)=11 presents evidence of misfit in the median curve for a few age groups (e.g. 14 d, 4 mo) for which corresponding 
plots have worms shifted down or up (Figure 1). The fit was improved by increasing the df(µ) to 12 
(Figure 5), and thus the co mbination of df(µ)=12 and df( /g305)=6 was chosen. Further evaluations of this 
model were carried out by examining the fit of the µ and /g305 curves and the patterns of the centile 
residuals (the empirical minus the fitted centiles) across age.

The fitted parameter curves show adequate smoothing despite the erratic coefficient of variation in the 
cross-sectional sample's height (Figure 2). The residual plots of the fitted centiles for the period 0 to 24 months (Figure 3) showed no evidence of bias. For the age range 24 to 71 months, residuals of 
the fitted centiles showed a non-random pattern for the 50
th centile, but were smaller than 0.6 cm up to 
60 months where estimated SDs vary from 3.5 to 5 cm (Figure 4).  
Table 13 shows the proportions of children with length (or height) below the fitted centiles. Age group 
labels correspond to the same age intervals provided in Table 14. Overall, there was no evidence of 
systematic departures from expected patterns suggestive of bias. Overestimates in the median 
(50th centile) for the age groups 14 d (55%), 2 mo (54%) and 40 mo (56%) were noted. The opposite 
was observed for the age group 70 mo (46%), i.e. the median was underestimated. The clinical significance of these few observed differences between fitted and observed proportions is likely to be 
small.

Figure 2 Fitting of µ and /g305 curves of Model 1 for length/height-for-age for boys (dotted line) 
and their respective sample estimates (points with solid line) 
The worm plots for Model 1 are shown in Figure 5. The worms fitted to the points (solid red line) do 
not indicate any upward or downward shifts except in the last age group (70 mo). This implies that, 
overall, the fit of the median was adequate. In older age groups (40 mo and above), extreme values are noted outside the 95% confidence interval depicted by the dotted curve lines. This may be due to some extreme values that were not considered as data errors or outliers. The shapes of the worms deviate 
slightly from flat, but remain within bounds of the confidence intervals. For example, the age groups 
40 mo, 46 mo and 70 mo present slightly U-shaped worms, indicating residual skewness to the left. There is no evidence of worms with a slope, which would indicate misfit in the variance curve.  S-shaped worms indicate a misfit in the curve of the parameter related to kurtosis as is the case in the 
birth and 58 mo age groups, although here too, the worms are contained within the 95% confidence 
interval.

The Q-test was performed to assess the overall significance of the deviations noted for the birth and 
40 mo, 46 mo, 58 mo age groups (Table 14). Absolute values of z3 larger than 2 were observed only in the age groups 40 mo and 46 mo, and for z4 at birth and in age group 58 mo. Nevertheless, the overall tests (p-values shown for each statistic in the last row of the table) do not suggest any significant departures of the fitted model z-scores from normality at the 5% level of significance.

Note: Absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 larger than 2 indicate misfit of, respectively, mean,  
variance, skewness or kurtosis. 
To evaluate whether Model 1 could be improved by modelling the parameter that corrects for 
skewness, a model using the BCPE distribution fixing /g306=2 and modelling the other three parameters 
was considered. The degrees of freedom of the cubic splines for µ and /g305 were kept as indicated earlier 
for Model 1, with the same age-transformation power. The best choice of degrees of freedom for the cubic splines to fit the parameter /g542 was then sought.

aIn excess of 65 000 
To assess the goodness of fit of the models considered within this class, only the GAIC(3)  values were 
compared, since this criterion penalizes more than does the AIC for increased degrees of freedom. 
Table 15 shows the GAIC(3)  values for degrees of freedom varying from 3 to 8. In this case df( /g542)=6 
presented the best fit, so the corresponding model was selected for further evaluation.  
Model 2: BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=12, df( /g305)=6, df( /g542)=6, /g306=2)
Model 2 yielded a GAIC(3)  of 65 369.0 compared with the 65 369.7 of Model 1. The results for Model 
2 from the same diagnostic tools/tests presented for Model 1 were compared to assess the impact of modelling skewness for specific ages.  
The worm plots for the z-scores derived from Model 2 (Figure 6) show very similar results to those 
that correspond to Model 1 (Figure 5). This indicates that deviations from normal that were observed 
in z-scores derived from Model 1 are unlikely to be corrected by modelling skewness. The Q-test for Model 2 (Table 16) provides slightly improved results where only one group (40 mo) has residual skewness compared to two groups in Model 1 (Table 14). Nonetheless both sets of results lead to the 
same conclusion, i.e. neither model's residuals (or z-scores) depart significantly from the normal 
distribution.  
Although some indication of residual kurtosis was observed in two of the 29 age groups after fitting 
both Models 1 and 2, the overall test results were not significant: Q-test (z4) p-values were 0.25 and 
0.26 for models 1 and 2, respectively (Tables 14 and 16).  
Table 17 presents the observed proportions of children below specific fitted centiles by age group. 
Observed proportion values are slightly closer to the expected proportion of children below the centiles for age groups 40 mo, 46 mo and 70 mo, when Model 2 is fitted, i.e. modelling skewness.

Figure 6 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 2 for length/heigh t-for-age for boys 
The diagnostic tools/tests used to evaluate distinct models supported the selection of the simplest 
model, i.e. the BCPE distribution with fixed /g542=1 and /g306=2, that corresponds to the normal distribution. 
Overall statistics like GAIC(3)  supported this choice. Considering local goodness of fit, the Q-test 
indicated minor departures from normality as reflected by the residuals (z-scores) of very few age groups when Model 1 was fitted. The worm plot results similarly indicate misfits for very few age 
groups. Since those isolated discrepancies or misfits were only partially corrected by modelling the 
parameter /g542 of the distribution (Model 2), it is reasonable to assume that these deviations occurred by 
chance or for other than biological reasons, and that the simpler model (i.e. Model 1) is adequate.  
Model 1 was selected and a new iteration was done using the values of df(µ) and df( /g305) equal to 12 and 
6, respectively, to re-search the best age-transformation power /g540. The smallest global deviance in this 
case was for /g540=0.4 (GD=65 315.6), but with only a very minor difference from the model using 
/g540=0.35 (GD=65 315.7). There was thus no need for updating /g540, and the selected model for 
constructing the length/height-for-age growth curves for boys remained BCPE(x= age
0.35, df(µ)=12, 
df(/g305)=6,/g542=1,/g306=2).

3.3 Length/height-for-age for girls  
The choice of the model to construct the length/height-for-age standards for girls followed the steps 
described for the corresponding standards for boys. In principle, unless a clear inadequacy is detected, 
models used for constructing the standards for both sexes should belong to the same class.  
3.3.1 Sample size 
There were 13 783 length/height observations for girls. The longitudinal and cross-sectional sample 
sizes by visit and age are presented in Tables 21 and 22.

3.3.2 Model selection and results 
Using the model BCPE(x=age/g540, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=6, /g542=1,/g306=2) as the starting point, the best age-
transformation power ( /g540) was sought. For girls, although the minimum global deviance corresponded 
to/g540=0.30, its performance was similar to the model with /g540=0.35 (Table 23) used for constructing the 
same standards for boys. Thus, /g540=0.35 was selected as the age-transformation power and a search 
followed for the best combination of degrees of freedom for the cubic splines to fit the BCPE distribution parameter curves.

The search for the best combination of degrees of freedom for the cubic splines to fit the µ and /g305
parameter curves started from the simplest class of models using the BCPE distribution and fixing /g542=1, 
/g306=2, and /g540=0.35. Table 24 shows various combinations that were considered. The best combination of 
AIC and GAIC(3)  pointed to the model with df(µ)=10 and df( /g305)=5. The properties of this model were 
evaluated using the same set of diagnostic tools used for length/height-for-age for boys.

Model 1: BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=5, /g542=1,/g306=2)
The two fitted parameter curves, i.e. the median and coefficient of variation appear to be adequately 
smoothed (Figure 17). Some evidence of a trend to underestimate extreme (3rd and 97th) centiles is shown in the distribution of the fitted centile residuals between birth and 24 months (Figure 18). Fitted 
centile residuals for the age interval 24 to 71 months showed mild systematic underestimations only 
for the 5th centile curve (Figure 19). The average bias for this centile curve was around 0.5 cm (SD estimates vary approximately from 3.2 to 5.5 cm across this age range). In this age interval, the proportions of children in the sample that are below the fitted 5th centile vary from 3.8% to 6%, but no clear pattern emerges to indicate bias. Overall, the distribution of the proportions below each of the 
fitted centiles does not indicate any bias (Table 25).

Figure 20 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 1 for length/height-for-age for girls 
Figure 20 shows the worm plots for Model 1. For a few age groups, the shapes of the worms depart 
slightly from the flat shape but are still constrained within the 95% confidence intervals. For example, groups 52 mo and 64 mo indicate slight overestimation of the median (worms pass below origin). 
There was some indication of residual skewness in a few age groups, i.e. those with U-shaped worms 
(2, 5, 20 and 22 mo), but only one age group (52 mo) had an S-shaped worm, suggesting residual kurtosis. Results of the Q-test presented in Table 26 show that the misfits in terms of median and skewness were not significant, since the corresponding z1 and z3 absolute values were all below 2. 
The only evidence of residual kurtosis was in age group 52 mo (z4=2.36). However, the Q-test results 
for the z-scores derived from the selected model applied across all age groups bore evidence of the model's overall adequacy (p-values corresponding to overall statistics were all greater than 0.40). More complex modelling (e.g. fitting parameter /g542) was therefore not pursued.  
A new iteration was done to re-search for the best /g540 with df(µ)=10 and df( /g305)=5. This exercise did not 
result in any notable changes to the previous findings. The model BCPE(x= age
0.35, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=5, 
/g542=1,/g306=2) was chosen to construct the length/height-for-age growth curves for girls. Figures 
21 to 24 show the empirical and fitted centiles derived from the selected model for the length-for-age 
(0 to 24 months) and height-for-age (24 to 71 months) growth curves. The final standards were 
constructed as described in detail in section 3.1.

- 79 - 4. CONSTRUCTION OF THE WEIGHT-FOR-AGE STANDARDS 
4.1 Indicator-specific methodology 
Similar steps to those described to select the best model for the length/height-for-age growth curves 
were followed to select the best model to construct the weight-for-age growth standards. The 
diagnostic tools applied to evaluate and compare candidate models were also similar. The weights of the longitudinal and cross-sectional samples were merged without any adjustments. To correct for right-edge effect, all data up to 71 months were used for modelling the weight-for-age growth curves 
but the standards were afterwards truncated at 60 completed months (Borghi et al., 2006). 
4.2 Weight-for-age for boys  
4.2.1 Sample size 
There were a total of 13 797 weight observations for boys. The longitudinal and cross-sectional 
sample sizes by visit and age are presented in Tables 30 and 31. In addition to the 20 home visits at which length was assessed in the longitudinal study, weight was also measured on day 7, except in 
Brazil (de Onis et al., 2004b).

/g306=2) was used as a starting point to search for the best value of the age-transformation power /g540 by 
examining changes in global deviance. Table 32 shows the global deviance for values of /g540 from 0 to 1. 
The smallest global deviance corresponded to the age-transformation power /g540=0.35.

The search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) followed, fixing /g540=0.35, /g542=1 and /g306=2. All possible 
combinations with df(µ) values ranging from 7 to 15 and df( /g305) from 2 to 10 were considered and 
partial results are presented in Table 33. No fitted model minimized both AIC and GAIC(3)
simultaneously. Models with df(µ)=11 or 12 and df( /g305)=7 or 8 provided either the smallest AIC or the 
smallest GAIC(3) . The model resulting in the smoothest µ and /g305 curves, i.e. df(µ)=11 and df( /g305)=7, 
was selected for further evaluation.

Model 1: BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, /g542=1,/g306=2)
For this model, both the worm plots (Figure 34) and the Q-test results (Table 34) indicated good model 
fit of the µ and /g305 curves but pointed to the need to adjust for skewness. The worms presented a  
U-shape in most age groups, indicating residual skewness. This finding was confirmed by the Q-test 
results (Table 34), which show various groups with absolute values of z3 higher than 2. Only one age group presented an absolute value of z4 higher than 2, indicating residual kurtosis. The overall test also rejected the hypotheses of no skewness (p-value < 0.01).

Note: Absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 larger than 2 indicate misfit of, respectively, mean, variance, 
skewness or kurtosis. 
The next step involved fitting the parameter /g542 for skewness using the BCPE distribution with fixed 
parameter /g306=2 and keeping the degrees of freedom for the µ and /g305 curves selected for Model 1. Table 
35 shows the GAIC(3)  values for various degrees of freedom for the /g542 curve.

The smallest GAIC(3)  value corresponded to df( /g542)=2 and the model BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=11, 
df(/g305)=7, df( /g542)=2,/g306=2) was further evaluated. 
Model 2: BCPE(x= age0.35, df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, df( /g542)=2, /g306=2)
Figure 35 shows the fitting of the parameters µ, /g305 and /g542 for Model 2 with their respective sample 
estimates, that is, the median for µ and Box-Cox transform power for /g542. It should be noted that the 
sample estimate for the parameter /g305 is no longer the coefficient of variation when the distribution 
departs significantly from the normal distribution. In this case, the best estimator of /g305 is the sample 
standard deviation of the Box-Cox transformed data (Cole and Green, 1992).  
Figures 36 and 37 show the distribution of the empirical minus fitted centile differences for the 
longitudinal and cross-sectional samples, respectively. For the longitudinal data, although there is some evidence of systematic overestimation in the 50th centile between 16 and 24 months, the average bias is less than 50 g (Figure 36) compared to SD values varying from 400 to 1800 g in this age range. For the cross-sectional component (Figure 37), underestimation in the 50th centile is noted between 
ages 25 and 35 months with an average bias of around 200 g relative to SD values varying from 1100 
to 3700 g in this age range.  
The worm plots for this model (Figure 38) were significantly improved compared to those of Model 1 
(Figure 34). The U-shaped worms flattened out significantly (Figure 38), indicating that the residual 
skewness associated with Model 1 had been corrected. The median curve remained underestimated in 
only one age group (70 mo). Various groups' worms present slight S-shapes, e.g. ages 0 to 2 months and group 64 mo, but all are contained within the 95% confidence interval.

The Q-test results from Model 2 are shown in Table 36. There were no absolute values larger than 2 
for the statistics z1, z2 or z3. Only one value of z4 (group 64 mo) suggested residual kurtosis. Considering this, there was no justification in increasing the complexity of the model by adjusting for kurtosis (modelling /g306). The overall Q-test p-values were all non-significant, indicating an adequate fit 
of the boys' weight-for-age curves.  
Table 37 presents observed percentages with weights below the fitted centiles. As expected, age 
groups above 24 months presented larger differences compared to the age range younger than 
24 months, yet there was no detectable pattern of a systematic bias.

skewness or kurtosis. 
A new iteration was performed using df( /g542)=2 to re-search for df(µ) and df( /g305) but, as before, no 
combination of df(µ) and df( /g305) was found for which both AIC and GAIC(3)  were simultaneously 
minimized. For example, AIC values were smallest for df(µ) 11 to 15, and df( /g305) 7 to 9, while GAIC(3)
values were smallest fo r df(µ) 11 or 12, and df( /g305) 7 or 8. Since the previously selected model still 
provided better GAIC(3)  with fixed df( /g542)=2, there was no need to change Model 2. A new search for 
the best value of /g540 was carried out using the selected model. The lowest global deviance values were 
associated with /g540 0.30 or 0.35, precluding the necessity to update the selected model. In conclusion, 
the model selected for constructing the weight-for-age growth curves for boys was BCPE(x=age0.35,
df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, df( /g542)=2, /g306=2) that adjusts only for skewness, and thus reduces in essence to the 
LMS method. The fitted centile curves and empirical centiles are shown in Figures 39 to 42.

4.3 Weight-for-age for girls  
Steps similar to those described in the preceding sections were followed to select the best model to fit 
the weight-for-age growth standard for girls.  
4.3.1 Sample size 
The data for constructing this standard combined weights from the longitudinal and cross-sectional 
samples without any adjustments. There were a total of 14 056 weight measurements for girls. The longitudinal and cross-sectional sample sizes by visit and age are presented in Tables 40 and 41.

4.3.2 Model selection and results 
The initial step in the modelling process was to search for the best age power transformation using the 
same starting model as that used for boys. Table 42 shows the values of global deviance for a grid of possible powers from 0 to 1. The smallest global deviance value was associated with /g540=0.4, but 
/g540=0.35 — the power used in constructing the same standard for boys — yielded very similar global 
deviance. Therefore, in the interest of homogeneity between boys and girls, /g540=0.35 was selected for 
the age transformation.

Using /g540=0.35, optimal values for df(µ) and df( /g305) were sought by fixing /g542=1 and /g306=2. All possible 
combinations of df(µ) values from 10 to 15 and df( /g305) from 2 to 10 were considered. Partial results are 
presented in Table 43. There was no combination df(µ) and df( /g305) that simultaneously minimized AIC
and GAIC(3) . The smallest values of AIC corresponded to df(µ) 11 to 13 and df( /g305) 8 to 10, while the 
smallest values of GAIC(3)  corresponded to df(µ)=11 and df( /g305) 7 or 8. Among these, the model that 
produced the smoothest curves, i.e. with df(µ)=11 and df( /g305)=7, was selected, since it presented the 
smallest number of degrees of freedom. This model was further evaluated.

Model 1: BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, /g542=1,/g306=2)
Table 44 shows the Q-test results for this model. As noted in constructing the weight-for-age standards 
for boys, this class of models was inadequate, i.e. strong evidence was observed of residual skewness 
in almost all age groups (absolute values of z3 larger than 2). Only one group out of 30 had an 
absolute value of z2 larger than 2, indicating misfit of the variance, while residual kurtosis was indicated in five age groups (absolute values of z4 larger than 2). It was clear that the parameter /g542
should be modelled to adjust for skewness. Consequently, the optimal df( /g542) was sought using df(µ)=11 
and df( /g305)=7 selected for the previous model, and fixing /g306=2. Table 45 summarizes the resulting 
goodness-of-fit statistics from this step.

The best df( /g542) was 5, according to the criterion GAIC(3) , and this model was further evaluated.  
Model 2: BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, df( /g542)=5, /g306=2)
With df( /g542)=5 the /g542 curve seemed under-smoothed. If this number  of degrees of freedom were used, it 
would probably result in the outer centile curves depicting a wiggly pattern not expected for this indicator, especially when compared to the boys' curve for the same parameter. When the degrees of freedom were reduced to df( /g542)=3, the shape of the /g542 curve seemed more adequate (Figure 47). For 
reasons that remain unclear, weight data for girls are more irregular than for boys, especially in the age 
range corresponding to the cross-sectional component.

The Q-test results for Model 2 are presented in Table 46. The adjustment for skewness corrected the 
kurtosis in all groups with residual kurtosis noted in Model 1 (Table 44) except for two groups (28 mo and 34 mo). The overall Q-test p-values for kurtosis became non-significant. The indication of 
variance misfit observed at 7 days for the previous model remained when fitting Model 2 (absolute 
value of z2 larger than 2).

As was the case for Models 1 and 2, the value of z2 for age group 7 days was higher than 2, pointing 
to variance misfit in an age interval of likely postnatal physiological adaptation. The same two age 
groups (28 mo and 34 mo) as observed for Model 2 indicated residual kurtosis.  
Figure 48 shows the fit of the parameter curves for the full age range (0 to 71 months) using Model 3.

Figure 48 Fitting of the µ, /g305, and /g542 curves of Model 3 for weight -for-age for girls  from 0 to 71 
months (dotted line) and their respective sample estimates (points with solid line) 
Figures 49 and 50 present the distribution of the centile residuals for Model 3. The residuals around 
the median were very small, about 40 g from 0 to 24 months (Figure 49), and although there were 
more positive than negative points, their magnitude was of likely minor clinical significance. The 3rd 
centile had a clear pattern of positive residuals from 12 to 24 months, but no other centiles presented any clear pattern suggestive of bias. Overall, the patterns of residuals from 24 to 71 months showed no evidence of bias (Figure 50). As expected, outer centiles presented more unstable patterns, especially 
above 60 months.  
Figure 51 presents worm plots for z-scores derived from Model 3 based on age groups as defined in 
Table 47. As expected, for a few age groups the worms indicated a misfit of the parameters: the age group 7 days presented a worm with a positive slope (indicating misfit of the variance) and the groups 
28 mo and 34 mo presented S-shaped worms (indicating residual kurtosis). These findings were 
similar to those from the Q-test (Table 47).  
Table 48 compares observed and expected proportions of children below each fitted centile. Results 
generally indicated no systematic pattern suggestive of bias or inadequacy of the fitted model.

Figure 51 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 3 for weight-for-age for girls 
The model was updated using df( /g542)=3, and one more iteration was performed to re-search for the best 
df(µ) and df( /g305). Results of AIC and GAIC(3)  led to the same combination df(µ)=11 and df( /g305)=7. The 
best /g540 value was then sought using the selected combination of degrees of freedom, i.e. df(µ)=11, 
df(/g305)=7 and df( /g542)=3. In this new iteration, the smallest values of global deviance were yielded by /g540
values between 0.25 and 0.30 (42 633.3 and 42 633.6, respectively). Yet differences in overall 
goodness of fit between those and the model using /g540=0.35 (global deviance equal to 42 634.6) were 
very small. Thus, the model BCPE(x=age0.35, df(µ)=11, df( /g305)=7, df( /g542)=3, /g306=2) was selected for 
constructing the weight-for-age growth curves for girls. The fitted centile curves and empirical centiles are shown in Figures 52 to 55.

- 139 - 5. CONSTRUCTION OF THE WEIGHT-FOR-LENGTH AND WEIGHT-FOR-
HEIGHT STANDARDS 
5.1 Indicator-specific methodology 
The construction of the weight-for-length (45 to 110 cm) and weight-for-height (65 to 120 cm) 
standards followed a procedure similar to that applied to constructing the length/height-for-age 
standards (see section 3.1). To fit a single model, 0.7 cm was added to the cross-sectional height 
values. This was the average difference found between length and height in 1625 children aged 18 to 30 months measured for both length and height. After the model was fitted, the weight-for-length 
centile curves in the length interval 65.7 to 120.7 cm were shifted back by 0.7 cm to derive the weight-
for-height standards corresponding to the height range 65 cm to 120 cm.  
There was an important distinction between age versus length/height as the x-axis variable. Although 
the study was designed to give a relatively constant number of observations per age group, this was 
not the case for length/height. Therefore, in contrast to the square tail of the uniform age distribution 
there was a light upper tail for the height distribution. The age-based indicator curves were constructed using all available data (0 to 71 months) but the resulting standards were truncated at 60 completed 
months to avoid the right-edge effect (Borghi et al., 2006). The construction of the weight-for-height 
standards followed this precedent by using the full range of available heights independently of age. The decision about where to set the upper limit for the weight-for-height standards was influenced by 
the need to accommodate the tallest children at age 60 months. The upper limit was set at 120 cm, 
approximately the +2 SD boys' height-for-age at 60 months. Few children in the MGRS sample were taller than 120 cm (91 boys and 72 girls) and the distribution of their heights distorted the trajectory of 
the median and other centiles because the sample was small and the observed weight values were 
clustered at the upper tail. Thus, observations with height values >120 cm were assigned a model weight=0 to avoid distorting the trajectory at the upper end of the height range. It was considered a sensible precaution to exclude height values above 120 cm from the modelling but retain them for the 
diagnostic tests and other types of assessment. The lower limit of the weight-for-length standards 
(45 cm) was chosen to cover up to approximately -2 SD girls' length at birth. 
5.2 Weight-for-length/height for boys  
5.2.1 Sample size 
There were 13 362 observations with both weight and length/height measurements. The longitudinal 
and cross-sectional samples were merged (after converting cross-sectional height values to length by 
adding 0.7 cm) and sample sizes by length interval are presented in Table 51.

5.2.2 Model selection and results 
There was no indication that a length/height transformation similar to that described for age was 
required for constructing the weight-for-length/height standards (i.e. global deviance values did not 
vary over the grid of /g540 values 0 to 1). Initial steps used the simplest model, i.e. the BCPE distribution 
with fixed /g542=1 and /g306=2 (the normal distribution). A search procedure for the best combination of df(µ) 
and df( /g305) was carried out. Table 52 summarizes the goodness-of-fit statistics for various combinations 
of df(µ) and df( /g305).
The models with df(µ)=13 or 14 and df( /g305)=6 resulted in the best fit. Because the median curve with 
df(µ)=13 was slightly wiggly, the model with df(µ)=12 was fitted to assess if improvement in 
smoothing would compensate for the loss in goodness of fit. The resulting difference in the trajectory 
of the median curve was negligible. Other models with progressively lower degrees of freedom for the 
µ curve were tested until significant smoothing was visible, but this was accompanied by significant 
losses in goodness of fit. Therefore, the original model with df(µ)=13 and df( /g305)=6 was adopted for 
further evaluation. The fact that the weight-for-length/height indicator combines different velocities 
for the two measurements involved (weight and length/height) at different ages likely explains the 
slight wiggle observed in the WHO standards and other references (CDC 2000 (Kuczmarski et al., 
2002) and Swiss (Prader et al., 1989)).

Model 1: BCPE(x=length (or height+0.7), df(µ)=13, df( /g305)=6, /g542=1,/g306=2)
Figure 63 shows the worm plots of the z-scores derived from Model 1. Intervals correspond to the 
length/height groups defined in Table 53. The worm plots were all U-shaped, indicating poor model fit due to skewness. Table 53 presents Q-test results of the z-scores from the same model. Almost all the length (or height+0.7) intervals presented absolute values of z3 larger than 2, confirming skewness in 
the data. No misfit was noted for the median or the variance (values of z1 and z2 within interval -2 to 
2).

Keeping df(µ) and df( /g305) as specified in Model 1, the next step was to search for the best degrees of 
freedom for the parameter /g542. Table 54 presents goodness-of-fit values for different degrees of freedom 
for the /g542 curve.  
The best GAIC(3)  was associated with df( /g542)=1. It is worth noting that there is a difference between a 
model with /g542=1 where the parameter /g542 is fixed at value 1, and a model with df( /g542)=1 where a constant 
is estimated by the maximum pseudo-likelihood method across the whole length/height range to define 
the /g542 parameter curve. In the latter, the /g542 parameter estimation contributes one degree of freedom to 
the total, while in the former case /g542 does not add to the model's total degrees of freedom.

Model 2: BCPE(x=length (or height+0.7), df(µ)=13, df( /g305)=6, df( /g542)=1, /g306=2)
The fitted curves of the parameters µ, /g305 and /g542 seemed adequate when compared to the empirical values 
(Figure 64). The distribution of the residuals from the fitted centile curves across length (or height+0.7) 
intervals (Figure 65) were investigated further to assess the fitted model's performance. The largest 
residuals were associated with the 97th centile in the two tallest groups. For all other centiles and length/height groups, the pattern of residuals indicated that the model's fit was most adequate.

According to the Q-test results in Table 55, only three groups had residual skewness, i.e. with an 
absolute value of z3 larger than 2, and one group had residual kurtosis as indicated by the absolute value of z4 larger than 2. Worm plots for this model reflect departures from normality of the derived z-
scores in the same groups indicated by the Q-test results (Figure 66). In addition, worms with non-flat 
shapes were noted in other groups but within their 95% confidence intervals. The worm for group 86 to 88 cm presented a steep slope, indicating misfit of the variance. The overall Q-test for kurtosis was not significant and since only one out of 29 length/height groups presented evidence of remaining kurtosis, increasing the model's complexity to include the modelling of the parameter /g306 was 
unwarranted.

mean, variance, skewness or kurtosis. 
Table 56 shows the percentage of children below the fitted centiles. Discrepancies between observed 
and expected proportions were small (except for the last group) and without any systematic pattern.  
The foregoing considerations led to selection of the model BCPE(x=length (or height+0.7), df(µ)=13, 
df(/g305)=6, df( /g542)=1,/g306=2) for constructing the weight-for-length/height growth curves for boys. One more 
iteration was done using df( /g542)=1 to re-search for the best values of df(µ) and df( /g305) for constructing the 
weight-for-length/height standards. The alternative model with df(µ)=15 and df( /g305)=6 presented AIC=
30 873.8 and GAIC(3) =30 895.8 compared with Model 2's AIC=30 875.1 and GAIC(3) =30 895.1. In 
sum, since the performances of the two models were very similar, the decision was to retain Model 2.

Figure 66 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 2 for weight-for-length/height for boys 
To derive the weight-for-height standards in the range 65 to 120 cm, the weight-for-length centile 
curves in the length interval 65.7 to 120.7 cm were shifted back by 0.7 cm for the reason explained previously (see also section 5.1). Figures 67 and 68 present fitted centile curves plotted against 
empirical weight-for-length values derived from the longitudinal component. Similarly, Figures 69 
and 70 present plots of fitted centiles against empirical weight-for-height values derived from the cross-sectional component.

5.3 Weight-for-length/hei ght for girls  
The choice of the model for constructing weight-for-length/height standards for girls followed similar 
steps as described for the analogous standards for boys (see section 5.1).
5.3.1 Sample size 
There was a total of 13 623 records with weight and length/height measurements from both the 
longitudinal and cross-sectional samples. The sample sizes by length interval are presented in Table 59.

a Height values were converted to length before merging the data (length=height+0.7). 
5.3.2 Model selection and results 
As was the case for boys, there was no need to transform length (or height) and /g540 was thus set to 1. 
Model selection followed with a search for the best combination of df(µ) and df( /g305), using models with 
fixed /g542=1 and /g306=2. Table 60 summarizes the goodness-of-fit statistics for various combinations of df(µ) 
and df( /g305). Since the models with df(µ)=12 to 14 and df( /g305)=4 resulted in comparable goodness of fit, 
the combination df(µ)=12 and df( /g305)=4, which had the lowest total degrees of freedom, was selected 
for further evaluation.

Model 1: BCPE(x= length (or height+0.7), df(µ)=12, df( /g305)=4, /g542=1,/g306=2)
Results of the Q-test indicated well fitted µ and /g305 curves, but residual skewness remained across 
almost all length groups (Table 61). Therefore, a new model including the modelling of parameter /g542
was sought.

Table 62 presents goodness of fit for various df( /g542) values, with the degrees of freedom for µ and /g305
from Model 1 and fixing /g306=2.
Although the model with df( /g542)=2 yielded the smallest GAIC(3) , the fitted /g542 curve — in this case a 
straight line with a negative slope — resulted in fitted values that caused the distribution to be 
excessively skewed at high height values. Since models with df( /g542)=2 and df( /g542)=1 presented similar 
GAIC(3) , the latter was chosen because it resulted in a smoother /g542 curve.

Figure 80 Centile residuals from fitting Model 2 for weight-for-length/height for girls 
Results of the Q-test for Model 2 are summarized in Table 63. Departures from normality and 
indications of misfit appeared in four of the 29 groups, with absolute values of z4 greater than 2, indicating residual kurtosis. However, the overall test for kurtosis was non-significant. The worm plots 
for this model indicated residual kurtosis for the same four length groups, as is evident in the S-shaped 
worms in Figure 81. No misfits in means, variances and skewness were observed. 
Potential improvements in adjusting for kurtosis were investigated by modelling /g306. The smoothing 
functions of Model 2 for the other thr ee parameters were used. Values of df( /g306) between 1 and 8 were 
considered. The model with the smallest GAIC(3)  was associated with the smoothing function 
f(/g306)=2.13  (GAIC(3) = 31 945.9). However, the difference between /g306=2 and /g306=2.13 had a negligible 
impact on the final centiles, despite the Q-test results for this model showing improvement and no residual kurtosis across all groups (Table 64). Moreover, results were slightly worse in terms of residual skewness in at least one group (74 to 76 cm), for which the resulting value of z3 was above 2. 
Plots of centile residuals for the model with /g306=2.13 (not shown) demonstrated no significant changes 
in the fitted centiles compared to those produced by Model 2. There were two disadvantages of varying the parameter /g306 from 2: first, it would increase complexity in application of the standards, i.e. 
calculation of z-scores or centiles would require using a distribution other than a transform-to-normal 
distribution; second, it would create inconsistency between sexes. This alternative model fitting the 
fourth parameter was therefore discarded.

A new iteration was done using df( /g542)=1 to re-search for the best combination of df(µ) and df( /g305). 
Model 2 still presented the smallest value of GAIC(3)  and very close AIC (31 936.0) to the model with 
smallest AIC, i.e. with df(µ)=14 and df( /g305)=4 (31 934.7). Thus, there was no necessity to update 
Model 2. 
In conclusion, the model BCPE(x=length (or height+0.7), df(µ)=12, df( /g305)=4, df( /g542)=1, /g306=2) was used 
to construct the weight-for-length and weight-for-height growth curves for girls. The centile curves for 
weight-for-height were constructed in the same way as described for boys, i.e. centiles were shifted back by 0.7 cm in the range 65.7 to 120.7 cm. Figures 82 and 83 show the weight-for-length centile curves, and Figures 84 and 85 show the weight-for-height centile curves for girls, including the 
empirical centiles.

- 229 - 6. CONSTRUCTION OF THE BODY MASS INDEX-FOR-AGE STANDARDS 
6.1 Indicator-specific methodology 
Body mass index (BMI) is the ratio weight (in kg)/recumbent length or standing height (in m2). To 
address the difference between length and height, the approach used for constructing the BMI-for-age standards was different from that described for length/height-for-age. Because BMI is a ratio with 
squared length or height in the denominator, adding 0.7 cm to the height values and back-transforming 
them after fitting was not feasible. The solution adopted was to construct the standards for the younger and the older children separately based on two sets of data with an overlapping range of ages below and above 24 months. To construct the BMI-for-age standard based on length (birth to 2 years), the 
longitudinal sample's length data and the cross-sectional sample's height data (18 to 30 months) were 
combined after adding 0.7 cm to the height values. Analogously, to construct the standard from 2 to 5 years, the cross-sectional sample's height plus longitudinal sample's length data (18 to 24 months) were combined after subtracting 0.7 cm from the length values. Thus, a common set of data from 18 to 30 months was used to generate the BMI standards for the younger and the older 
children. The resulting disjunction between the two standards thus in essence reflects the 0.7 cm 
difference between length and height. This does not mean, however, that a child at a specific age will have the same length- and height-based BMI-for-age z-score as this is mathematically impossible given the nature of the BMI ratio. The WHO length- and height-based BMI-for-age standards do not 
overlap, i.e. the length-based interval ends at 730 days and the height-based interval starts at 731 days.  
The BMI curve's steep rise from birth to 6 or 7 months required a power transformation of age with 
power very close to zero to stretch the x-axis before fitting the model. This created a large gap between the observations at birth and at 14 days on the transformed age scale. This fact, combined 
with the use of flexible cubic splines to model the median curve, resulted in an artificial pattern in that 
age interval when back-transformed to the original age scale. To avoid this problem and ensure that the curves remained closely patterned on the empirical values, an alternative choice was to create individual BMI values at age 7 days and then linearly interpolate between birth and 7 days, and 
between 7 and 14 days. Although weight was measured at 7 days, there was no corresponding length 
measurement to calculate BMI at that age. Therefore to create BMI values for age 7 days, individual lengths for that age were estimated by linear interpolation, i.e. the mid point between length at birth and at 14 days was used.  
Q-test, worm plots and comparisons of observed and expected proportions of children with BMI 
values below fitted centiles presented hereafter included the interpolated values for age group 7 days. It was reassuring to see that the empirical centiles remained very close to the fitted values at the observed ages, birth and 14 days, when the model included the interpolated values.

6.2 BMI-for-age for boys  
Steps similar to those used to fit the weight-for-age standard were used to select the best model for the 
BMI-for-age standards for boys. The diagnostic tools to evaluate and compare different models also were the same.  
6.2.1 Sample size 
There were 13 362 records with both weight and length/height for boys. The longitudinal and cross-
sectional sample sizes by visit and age are presented in the Tables 68 and 69.

6.2.2 Model selection and results 
Length-based BMI-for-age for boys 
The model BCPE(x=age/g540, df(µ)=9, df( /g305)=4, df( /g542)=4,/g306=2) was used initially to assess variations in the 
age-transformation power /g540 and to determine the best fit as reflected by global deviance. Table 70 
shows the global deviance for a grid of /g540 values between 0 and 0.5. The smallest global deviance was 
associated with the age-transformation power /g540=0.01. However, /g540=0.05 was selected because the 
problem caused in fitting cubic splines in the transformed age scale and back-transforming afterwards was worse with /g540=0.01 than with /g540=0.05, yet the global deviance for the latter was not much larger.

The search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) was carried out using /g540=0.05 as the age-transformation power 
and comparing the goodness of fit of various models with fixed parameters /g542=1 and /g306=2. All possible 
combinations of df(µ) 7 to 15 and df( /g305) 2 to 10 were considered. Partial results are presented in Table 
71. The best combination of AIC and GAIC(3)  corresponded to df(µ)=10 and df( /g305)=4. Worm plots and 
Q-test for this model also were examined.

Model 1: BCPE(x=age0.05, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=4, /g542=1,/g306=2)
Worm plots (Figure 100) and Q-test results (Table 72) indicated misfit across various age intervals due 
to residual skewness and/or kurtosis. The worms were U-shaped for many of the age groups, 
indicating residual skewness. In the Q-test results most of the groups had absolute values of z3 larger than 2, suggesting residual skewness, and three age groups presented values of z4 larger than 2, indicating residual kurtosis. The overall tests for both skewness and kurtosis combining all age groups 
were significant. 
This model was therefore considered inadequate. The next step involved fitting the parameter /g542, to 
adjust for skewness, using the BCPE distribution and fixing only the parameter /g306=2. Table 73 shows 
GAIC(3)  values for various choices of df( /g542), maintaining df(µ) and df( /g305) as selected for Model 1.  -0.4 0.0 0.4

Model 2: BCPE(x=age0.05, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=4, df( /g542)=3, /g306=2)
Figure 101 shows the fitting of the parameters µ, /g305 and /g542 for Model 2 with their respective sample 
estimates. The fitted /g305 curve underestimated the high peak in the empirical curve (the St Dev Box-Cox 
transformed BMI) at 7 days. The smoothing function of the Box-Cox transformation power ( /g542 curve) 
did not follow the unstable pattern of the empirical curve, and thus partially controlled the skewness associated with parameter /g542 at the end of the 0 to 24 month age interval.

Figure 102 shows the distribution of the centile residuals, i.e. empirical minus fitted centiles, for the 
longitudinal sample (0 to 24 months). There was no evidence of systematic bias. The worm plots for 
this model (Figure 103) showed that adjustment for skewness corrected the previous model's misfit (Figure 100), i.e. U-shaped worms flattened fairly well. Few age groups still retained slightly S-shaped worms but all constrained within the 95% confidence intervals.

Figure 102 Centile residuals from fitting Model 2 for length-based  
BMI-for-age from 0 to 24 months for boys 
Q-test results of the z-scores from Model 2 are shown in Table 74. All absolute values for the statistics 
z1, z2, z3 and z4 were smaller than 2, apart from one z4 value at age 7 days indicating residual kurtosis. P-values for overall tests were all non-significant, indicating adequate fit for the BMI-for-age 
growth curves for boys. Table 75 presents observed percentages below the fitted centiles, which give 
no indication of systematic bias.  
Since residual kurtosis was indicated for only one out of 23 age groups and the overall test was not 
significant, modelling the parameter /g306 and thus increasing the model's complexity was considered 
unnecessary.

Model 2, BCPE(x= age0.05, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=4 ,df( /g542)=3, /g306=2), was selected to fit the BMI-for-age 
growth curves for boys from birth to 24 months. This model adjusts only for skewness and belongs to the same class of models used for the LMS method. A further iteration was done, fixing df( /g542)=3 and  
re-searching for the best combination of df(µ) and df( /g305), but Model 2 still presented the best 
performance in both AIC and GAIC(3) . Then, using the selected degrees of freedom for µ, /g305 and /g542
curves, the best /g540 was re-searched. Results confirmed that values of /g540 close to zero resulted in the 
lowest global deviance. However, for reasons stated previously (see discussion in connection with Table 70) /g540 was kept at value 0.05. 
The final centile curves are shown in Figures 104 and 105 plotted with the empirical centiles.

Height-based BMI-for-age for boys 
To construct the BMI-for-age growth standard using height, the need for an age-transformation power 
/g540 before fitting the model was evaluated. Results indicated that no age transformation was necessary. 
The class of models selected for constructing the length-based standard was the first option to be considered for constructing the height-based BMI-for-age standard.  
Using the BCPE distribution, the µ and /g305 parameter curves were modelled and parameters /g542 and /g306
were fixed at values 1 and 2, respectively. The search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) was carried out by 
comparing the goodness of fit of various models. All possible combinations of df(µ) 3 to 10 and df( /g305)
2 to 6 were considered. Partial results are presented in Table 76. The best combination of AIC and 
GAIC(3)  corresponded to df(µ)=4 and df( /g305)=3. This model was used as a first step to search for the 
best degrees of freedom  for the parameter /g542. Table 77 shows a summary of the goodness-of-fit results 
from various models.

Although the smallest GAIC(3)  corresponded to df( /g542)=1, the fitting of a constant led to the 
underestimation of this parameter, resulting in an overestimation of skewness in the age interval of 
interest, i.e. 24 to 60 months. Therefore, the option df( /g542)=3, which was associated with the second 
smallest GAIC(3) value (Table 77), was selected. This model's goodness-of-fit was investigated further.

Figure 107 shows the distribution of the centile residuals, i.e. the difference between empirical and 
fitted centiles, using only the cross-sectional sample from 18 to 71 months. There was a tendency to slightly underestimate values of the central centiles (25th, 50th and 75th) at the beginning of the age interval. But this indication of bias was not confirmed by the proportions of children with observed BMI values below fitted centiles (Table 78). The results in Table 78 show no evidence of bias in any 
of the centiles.

Note: Absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 larger than 2 indicate misfit of, respectively, mean, 
variance, skewness or kurtosis. 
Q-test results of the z-scores from the selected model are shown in Table 79. No indication of misfit 
was noted for any of the four distributional parameters. Only one age group (23–25 mo) had an 
absolute value of z2 slightly above 2. This was likely the result of smoothing out the irregularity at the 
merging point of the longitudinal and cross-sectional sub-samples. Figure 108 shows the worm plots for the z-scores derived from Model 1. The plots show no evidence of departure from the normal 
distribution or misfit of the selected model. Worms were fairly flat across all age groups, apart from two groups (23–25 and 53–55 mo) whose worms had slopes indicating a slight misfit of the variance. 
No adjustment for kurtosis a ppeared to be necessary.

Figure 108 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 1 for height-based BMI-for-age for boys 
A new iteration to re-search for the best values of df(µ) and df( /g305) with respect to AIC and GAIC(3)
was done using df( /g542)=3, but the previous choice was confirmed and there was no need to update the 
model. In conclusion, the model selected for the height-based BMI-for-age curves for boys was BCPE(x=age, df(µ)=4, df( /g305)=3,df( /g542)=3,/g306=2). The standard's fitted centile curves and empirically 
derived centiles are shown in Figures 109 and 110.

Steps similar to those used for fitting the equivalent standards for boys were followed to select the best 
model to fit the BMI-for-age growth standards for girls. The diagnostic tools used to evaluate and compare different models were the same.  
6.3.1 Sample size 
A total of 13 623 records with both weight and length/height were available for constructing the BMI-
for-age curves for girls. The longitudinal and cross-sectional sample sizes by visit and age are presented in the Tables 83 and 84.

6.3.2 Model selection and results 
Length-based BMI-for-age for girls 
The model BCPE(x=age/g540, df(µ)=9, df( /g305)=4, df( /g542)=4, /g306=2) was used to begin the search for the best 
age-transformation power /g540. Table 85 shows the global deviance for a grid of values of /g540 between 0 
and 0.5. As for boys, the smallest global deviance corresponded to an age-transformation power of 
/g540=0.01 but /g540=0.05 yielded very close global deviance. For the same reasons described earlier for the 
boys' corresponding standard, the age-transformation power /g540=0.05 was selected.

Using /g540=0.05 as the age-transformation power, the search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) was carried out 
by comparing the goodness of fit of various models, fixing /g542=1 and /g306=2. All possible combinations of 
df(µ) 7 to 15 and df( /g305) 2 to 10 were considered. Partial results are presented in Table 86.

The smallest value of AIC corresponded to df(µ)=11 and df( /g305)=6, while the smallest value of GAIC(3)
was associated with df(µ)=10 and df( /g305)=3. Using 6 degrees of freedom to fit the /g305 curve resulted in a 
very irregular pattern (Figure 116) compared to the boys' curve (Figure 101). The model that appeared to have the best smoothing outcome in the centile curves (df(µ)=10 and df( /g305)=3) was therefore 
evaluated further.

Q-test results (Table 87) showed that, for 14 out of 23 age groups, absolute values of z3 were above 2, 
showing residual skewness. Only one age group (7 days) had an absolute value of z2 above 2, which indicated misfit of variance, and another group (24 mo) had an absolute value of z4 larger than 2, 
pointing to residual kurtosis.

Note: Absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 larger than 2 indicate misfit of, respectively, mean, variance, 
skewness or kurtosis. 
Worm plots mostly supported the findings of the Q-test results (Figure 117). The majority of the 
worms were U-shaped and the group at 7 days presented a worm with a slope. The group with absolute value of z4 larger than 2 in the Q-test did not have an S-shaped worm, likely due to the fact 
that the residual kurtosis was an effect of the misfit in the skewness. Model 1 was thus considered 
inadequate. The search for the best model proceeded with the modelling of the /g542 curve in addition to µ 
and /g305.

Figure 120 Worm plots of z-scores for Model 2 for length-based BMI-for-age for girls 
The worm plots for Model 2 (Figure 120) are mostly flat, i.e. with no obvious indication of misfit. 
Worms with slight slopes were noted for a few groups, the most evident being at 7 days, the imputed 
age group. Q-test results for the z-scores from Model 2 are shown in Table 89. For the selected age 
groups, there were no absolute values larger than 2 for any of the statistics z1 and z3, indicating no misfit of the median or skewness. For only one age group (7 days), the test indicated misfit of the variance, and for two age groups (6 and 9 mo) results suggested mild residual kurtosis (i.e. absolute values of z4 marginally above 2). The overall tests' p-values were all non-significant, indicating an 
adequate fit of this model for the BMI-for-age for girls from birth to 2 years. Table 90 presents the 
observed percentages of the sample that were below the fitted centiles. No indications of systematic bias were noted for any of the centiles.

Note: Absolute values of z1, z2, z3 or z4 larger than 2 indicate misfit of, respectively, mean, variance, 
skewness or kurtosis. 
Since residual kurtosis was noted for only two out of the 23 age groups and the overall test was not 
significant, as with the boys' curves, modelling parameter /g306 was not considered necessary. 
The model BCPE(x=age0.05, df(µ)=10, df( /g305)=3, df( /g542)=3, /g306=2) was used to fit the BMI-for-age curves 
for girls from birth to 24 months. A new iteration was then done, fixing df( /g542)=3 and re-searching for 
the best combination of df(µ) and df( /g305), but Model 2 still presented the smallest value of GAIC(3)  and 
its performance was very close to that of the model with the smallest AIC. A re-search was then done 
for the best /g540 value with the selected degrees of freedom for the µ, /g305 and /g542 curves. Results confirmed 
that /g540 values closest to zero were associated with the lowest global deviance, but for the reasons stated 
earlier for boys, /g540=0.05 was selected in preference to /g540=0.01. Thus, Model 2 was not updated. 
The fitted curves are compared to empirical centiles in Figures 121 and 122.

Height-based BMI-for -age for girls 
As with the boys' height-based BMI-for-age standards, no age transformation was necessary prior to 
fitting the model for girls. The search for the best model was restricted initially to the same class of 
models selected for the first 2 years of age. A thorough evaluation was carried out to assess the model's adequacy. 
As was the case for boys, there was no need to transform age and /g540 was thus set to 1. The BCPE 
distribution was used, and to initiate the search for the best df(µ) and df( /g305) the µ and /g305 parameter 
curves were modelled with fixed /g542=1 and /g306=2. This was carried out by comparing the goodness of fit 
of models with all possible combinations of df(µ) 3 to 10 and df( /g305) 2 to 6. Partial results are presented 
in Table 91.

Although best fitting according to the selected criteria AIC and GAIC(3)  was associated with larger 
values of df(µ), 4 was the maximum number of degrees of freedom for which the model produced a 
smooth median curve. Values of df(µ) greater than 4 resulted in median curves with varying degrees 
of zigzag pattern (Figure 123).

Thus, the combination df(µ)=4 and df( /g305)=4 was selected to proceed with the search for the best 
degrees of freedom for the parameter /g542 and subsequent steps to the final model's selection. Table 92 
shows a summary of goodness of fit for models with various specifications of df( /g542). The smallest 
value of GAIC(3)  corresponded to df( /g542)=1, which fits a constant value throughout the age interval of 
interest and this model was further evaluated. It should be noted that there is a difference between a model with /g542=1, where the parameter /g542 is fixed at value 1, and a model with df( /g542)=1, where a constant 
is estimated by the maximum pseudo-likelihood method across the whole length/height range to define 
the /g542 parameter curve. In the latter case, the /g542 parameter estimation contributes one degree of freedom 
to the total, while in the former /g542 does not add to the model's total degrees of freedom.

Model 1: BCPE(x=age, df(µ)=4, df( /g305)=4, df( /g542)=1, /g306=2)
Figure 124 illustrates the fitting of parameters µ, /g305 and /g542 using Model 1 and their respective empirical 
estimates. One group's median empirical value (around 46 months) departed widely from the fitted value and its neighbouring groups' medians. One advantage of the method used is that it fits the 
median and other parameters continuously on age, thus this age group's deviation did not much affect 
the fitted median trajectory.

Figure 125 shows the distribution of the centile residuals, i.e. the difference between empirical and 
fitted centiles for the cross-sectional sample from 18 to 71 months. Residuals for the centiles above the 50th were scattered more randomly than those for the lower-half centiles. There was a tendency to underestimate the 3rd, 5th and 10th centiles. These deviations, however, were small (on average around 0.2 kg/m
2) except for the age group around 46 months (see also Figures 127 and 128).

from 18 to 71 months for girls 
Figure 126 shows the worm plots for the z-scores derived from Model 1. There is evidence of misfit of 
the median for age group 29–31 mo, i.e. this group's worm plot exhibited an upward shift. The same 
diagnosis can be made from the Q-test results (Table 93), i.e. z1 value was 2.96 for the same age group. The worm plot corresponding to the age interval 44–46 mo was S-shaped, indicating residual kurtosis, but likely related to the misfit of variance suggested by the Q-test results for this same group 
(Table 93). Both Q-test results and worm plots pointed to residual skewness in age group 35–37 mo, 
the absolute value of z3 being larger than 2 and the worm U-shaped. Although overall Q-test statistics indicated significant misfit of the median curve (p-value<0.05), this was evidently due to only one age group. The loss in goodness of fit was compensated by the gain in smoothness of the final curves. 
Apart from the median, the other overall Q-test statistics were non-significant.

Table 94 presents observed percentages of the sample below the fitted centiles. Although 
discrepancies between observed and expected proportions were sizable in some cases (e.g. age group 
29–31 mo), no systematic patterns were noted over the age range.  
The height-based BMI-for-age curves for girls were thus fitted using the model BCPE(x=age, df(µ)=4, 
df(/g305)=4, df( /g542)=1, /g306=2). This model smoothed out observed irregular patterns, and for this reason no 
additional iteration was done fixing df( /g542)=1 and re-searching for the be st combination of df(µ) and 
df(/g305).

- 301 - 7. COMPUTATION OF CENTILES AND Z-SCORES FOR LENGTH/HEIGHT-
FOR-AGE, WEIGHT-FOR-AGE, WEIGHT-FOR-LENGTH, WEIGHT-FOR-
HEIGHT AND BMI-FOR-AGE 
The method used to construct the standards based on weight, length/height and age, generally relied on 
GAMLSS with the Box-Cox power exponential distribution (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2004a). 
However, the final selected models simplified to the LMS model (Cole and Green, 1992) since none of the standards required adjustment for kurtosis. As a result, the computation of percentiles and z-scores for these standards uses formulae based on the LMS method. However, a restriction was imposed on 
all indicators to enable the derivation of percentiles only within the interval corresponding to z-scores 
between -3 and 3. The underlying reasoning is that percentiles beyond ±3 SD are invariant to changes in equivalent z-scores. The loss accruing to this restriction is small since the inclusion range corresponds to the 0.135th to 99.865th percentiles. 
For all indicators, the tabulated fitted values of Box-Cox power, median and coefficient of variation 
corresponding to age (or length/height) tare denoted by L(t),M(t) and S(t), respectively. 
Centiles and z-scores for length/height-for-age For this indicator, L(t) is equal to 1, simplifying the Box-Cox normal distribution used in the LMS 
method to the normal distribution. Therefore, differences between adjacent standard deviations (e.g. 
between 2 SD and 3 SD) were constant for a specific age but varied at different ages. 
In this case, the centiles at age t can be estimated from:

Z Zt StDevtMZtS tM ZtStL tMt CtL
where Z/g302  is the normal equivalent deviate for tail area /g302, C100 /g302(t) is the 100 /g302-th centile, and 
StDev(t)  is the standard deviation at age t (derived from multiplying S(t) by M(t) ).

Centiles and z-scores for weight-for-age, weight-for-length, weight-for-height and BMI-for-age 
The weight-based indicators presented right-skewed distributions. When modelled correctly, right 
skewness in data has the effect of making distances between positive z-scores increase progressively 
the farther away they are from the median, while distances between negative z-scores decrease progressively. The LMS method fits skewed data adequately by using a Box-Cox normal distribution, which follows the empirical data closely. The drawback, however, is that the outer tails of the 
distribution are highly affected by extreme data points even if only very few (e.g. less than 1%). A 
restricted application of the LMS method was thus used for the construction of the WHO weight-based indicators, limiting the Box-Cox normal distribution to the interval corresponding to z-scores where empirical data were available (i.e. between -3 SD and 3 SD). Beyond these limits, the standard 
deviation at each age (or length/height) was fixed to the distance between ±2 SD and ±3 SD, 
respectively. This approach avoids making assumptions about the distribution of data beyond the limits of the observed values. 
As a result of this adjustment, the z-score distribution can depart slightly from normality at the 
extreme tails (beyond ±3 SD), although the expected practical impact is minimal.

- 305 - 8. CONCLUSION 
The goal of the MGRS was to describe the growth of healthy children. Well-defined criteria were 
applied in the study design to achieve this aim. Screening at enrolment using site-specific 
socioeconomic criteria and maternal non-smoking status excluded children likely to experience 
constrained growth. Morbidities that affect growth (e.g. repeated bouts of infectious diarrhoea and Crohn disease) were identified and affected children were excluded from the sample. Application of these criteria resulted in the exclusion of all detectable undernutrition from both the longitudinal and 
cross-sectional samples.  
In the longitudinal sample, the criterion of breastfeeding through 12 months and its close monitoring 
throughout data collection yielded a sample of children with no evidence of overnutrition (i.e. no excessive right skewness). In the cross-sectional sample, however, despite the criterion of at least 
3 months of any breastfeeding, the sample was exceedingly skewed to the right, indicating the need to 
identify and exclude excessively high weights for height if the goal of constructing a standard was to be achieved. A similar prescriptive approach was taken by the developers of the CDC 2000 growth charts for the USA when, for the weight and BMI growth charts, they excluded data from the last 
national survey (i.e. NHANES III) for children aged /g1496 years. Without this exclusion, the 95th and 
85th percentile curves of the CDC charts would have been higher, and fewer children would have been classified as overweight or at risk of overweight (Kuczmarski et al., 2002). 
The construction of the child growth curves followed a careful, methodical process. Rigorous methods 
of data collection, standardized across sites, were followed during the entire study. Sound procedures 
for data management and cleaning were applied (Onyango et al., 2004). As a result, the anthropometric data available for analysis were of the highest possible quality. The selection of the best statistical approach to construct the standards followed a broad consultative process that included a thorough review of 30 available methods. State-of-the-art statistical methodologies were then 
employed to generate the standards (Borghi et al., 2006).  
The Box-Cox-power-exponential (BCPE) method (Rigby and Stasinopoulos, 2004a), with curve 
smoothing by cubic splines, was selected as the approach for constructing the growth curves. The BCPE accommodates various kinds of distributions, from normal to skewed or kurtotic, as necessary. 
There was wide variability in the degrees of freedom required for the cubic splines to achieve the best 
models. Except for length/height-for-age, which followed a normal distribution, all other standards required the modelling of skewness but not kurtosis. A set of diagnostic tools was used to detect possible biases in estimated percentile or z-score curves. These included examining patterns of 
differences between empirical and fitted centiles, and comparing observed and expected proportions of 
children with measurements below selected percentile curves. Percentile and z-score curves for boys and girls aged 0–60 months were generated for length/height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length (45 to 110 cm), weight-for-height (65 to 120 cm) and body mass index-for-age. The last 
indicator is an addition to the previously available set of indicators in the NCHS/WHO reference. 
Appendix A summarizes the specifications of the BCPE models for each of the standards. 
It was possible to construct both length-for-age (birth to 2 years) and height-for-age (2 to 5 years) 
standards fitting a unique model, yet still reflect the average difference between recumbent length and 
standing height. The cross-sectional component included the measurement of both length and height in 
1625 children aged 18 to 30 months, and from these data it was estimated that length was larger by 0.7 cm on average. To fit a single model for the whole age range, 0.7 cm was therefore added to the cross-sectional height values. After the model was fitted, the final curves were shifted downwards by 
0.7 cm for ages 2 years and above to create the height-for-age standards. Coefficient of variation 
values were adjusted to reflect this back-transformation using the shifted medians and standard deviations. The length-for-age standard was derived directly from the fitted model. A similar approach was followed in generating the weight-for-length (45 to 110 cm) and weight-for-height (65 to 120 cm) standards. 
306 Conclusion 
The difference between length and height was handled differently in constructing the BMI-for-age 
standards. Because BMI is a ratio with squared length or height in the denominator, adding 0.7 cm to 
the height values and back-transforming them after fitting was not feasible. The solution adopted was 
to construct the standards for the younger and the older children separately based on two sets of data with an overlapping range of ages below and above 24 months. To construct the BMI-for-age standard based on length (birth to 2 years), the longitudinal sample's length data and the cross-sectional 
sample's height data (18 to 30 months) were combined after adding 0.7 cm to the height values. 
Analogously, to construct the standard from 2 to 5 years, the cross-sectional sample's height plus longitudinal sample's length data (18 to 24 months) were combined after subtracting 0.7 cm from the length values. Thus, a common set of data from 18 to 30 months was used to generate the BMI standards for the younger and the older children. 
Overall, concordance between smoothed curves and empirical centiles was excellent and free of bias 
in both the median range and the tails, indicating that the resulting curves are an adequate description of the true growth of healthy children. The length- and height-for-age standards had the best fit, and the performance was almost as good for the standards based on combinations of weight and length. 
For example, the average absolute difference between smoothed and empirical centiles was 0.13 cm 
for boys' length-for-age (Figure 7) and 0.16 kg for girls' weight-for-height (Figure 84). Taking the sign into account, the average differences are close to zero: -0.03 cm and -0.02 kg, respectively, which indicates lack of bias in the fit between smoothed and empirical percentiles.  
Differences between the previously recommended NCHS/WHO international reference and the new 
WHO standards have been illustrated in this rep ort. As expected, there are notable differences that 
vary by age, sex, anthropometric measure and specific percentile or z-score curve. Differences are particularly important in infancy. Impact on population estimates of child malnutrition will depend on 
age, sex, anthropometric indicator considered, and population-specific anthropometric characteristics. 
Thus, it is impossible to construct an algorithm that can derive prevalence estimates based on the WHO standards directly from estimates obtain ed from the NCHS/WHO reference. A noteworthy 
effect is that estimates of stunting will be higher throughout childhood when assessed using the new 
WHO standards compared to the previous international reference. The growth pattern of breastfed 
infants compared to the NCHS/WHO reference will result in a substantial increase in underweight rates during the first half of infancy (i.e. 0–6 months) and a decrease thereafter. For wasting, the main difference between the new standards and the old reference is during infancy (i.e. up to about 70 cm length) when wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect to 
overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, 
sex and nutritional status of the index population.  
To interpret differences between the WHO standards and the NCHS/WHO reference it is important to 
understand that they reflect differences not only in the populations used but also in the methodologies 
applied to construct the two sets of growth curves. To address the significant skewness of the 
NCHS/WHO samples' weight-for-age and weight-for-height, the developers of the reference calculated separate standard deviations for distributions below and above the median for each of the two indicators (Dibley et al., 1987). This approach is limited in fitting skewed data, especially at the 
extreme tails of the distribution, since it only partially adjusts for the skewness inherent in the weight-
based indicators. When modelled correctly, the right skewness in data has the effect of making distances between positive z-scores increase progressively the farther away they are from the median, while distances between negative z-scores decrease progressively. To fit the skewed data adequately, 
the LMS method (Cole and Green, 1992) fits a Box-Cox normal distribution, which follows the 
empirical data closely. The drawback of this method is that the outer tails of the distribution are highly affected by extreme data points even if very few (e.g. less than 1%). A restricted application of the LMS method was thus used for the construction of the WHO weight-based indicators, limiting the Box-Cox normal distribution to the interval corresponding to z-scores where empirical data were 
Conclusion 307
available (i.e. between -3 SD and 3 SD). Beyond these limits, the standard deviation was fixed to the 
distance between ±2 SD and ±3 SD, respectively. This approach avoids making assumptions about the distribution of the data beyond the limits of the actual data (e.g. the 3 SD corresponds to the 
99.9th percentile). The construction of the CDC 2000 growth charts (Kuczmarski, 2002) was also 
based on the LMS method and, therefore, differences seen in the comparisons between this reference and the WHO standards are largely a reflection of differences in the populations on which the two sets of curves are based. 
The WHO Child Growth Standards provide a technically robust tool for assessing the well-being of 
infants and young children. They were derived from children who were raised in environments that minimized constraints to growth such as poor diets and infection. In addition, their mothers followed healthy practices such as breastfeeding their children and not smoking during and after pregnancy. The 
standards depict normal early childhood growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be 
used to assess children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding. Replacing the NCHS/WHO growth reference, which is based on children from a single country, with one based on an international group of children recognizes the fact that children the world over grow similarly when their health and care needs are met. In the same way, linking physical growth to motor 
development underscores the importance of looking at child development comprehensively. Together, 
three new elements — a prescriptive  approach that moves beyond the development of growth 
references towards a standard, inclusion of children from around the world, and links between physical growth and motor development — provide a solid instrument for helping to meet the health and 
nutritional needs of the world’s children.

In 1993 the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook a 
comprehensive review of the uses and interpretation of 
anthropometric references. The review concluded that the 
NCHS/WHO growth reference, which had been recommended for 
international use since the late 1970s, did not adequately represent 
early childhood growth and that new growth curves were necessary. The World Health Assembly endorsed this recommendation in 1994. 
The WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) was 
undertaken in response to that endorsement and implemented between 
1997 and 2003 to generate new curves for assessing the growth and 
development of children the world over. The MGRS collected primary growth data and related information from 8440 healthy 
breastfed infants and young children from diverse ethnic backgrounds 
and cultural settings (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and USA). 
The growth standards developed based on these data and presented in 
this report provide a technically robust tool that represents the best 
description of physiological growth for children under five years of 
age. The standards depict normal early childhood growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be used to assess children 
everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of 
feeding.
