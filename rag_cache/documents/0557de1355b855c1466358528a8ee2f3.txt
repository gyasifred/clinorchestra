Received 23 March 2019Received in revised form 22 August 2019Accepted 28 August 2019Background: This study compared the performance of a single blood draw of high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT),
high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and conventional troponin I (cTnI) within a modi ﬁed HEART score for
predicting 30-day MACE at Emergency Department (ED) presentation, and established local reference norms
for all three assays by determining the cut-off point which yielded the highest sensitivity and negative predictivevalue for acute myocardial infarction and 30-day MACE.
Methods: This single-center prospective cohort study recruited chest pain patients at the ED, whose hsTnT, hsTnI
and cTnI were taken on admission. Subjects were classi ﬁed into low and non-low risk group according to their
modi ﬁed HEART score, with MACE as the primary endpoint. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were generated, area under the curves (AUCs) were calculated; the performance characteristics were deter-
mined.Results: The performance of modi ﬁed HEART scores was comparable among the three assays for 30-day MACE
(84.9 –87.0% sensitivity, 95.6 –96.0% NPV, 95%CI) and none of these had very high AUC and speci ﬁcity (AUC
0.70 –0.71, 53.7 –56.7% speci ﬁcity, 95% CI). The modi ﬁed HEART score using a single blood draw of either hsTnT
(3.9 ng/L), hsTnI (0.9 ng/L) or cTnI (0.0 ng/L) at presentation yielded a sensitivity of 100% for 30-day MACE.Conclusion: The modi ﬁed HEART score using a single blood draw of either hsTnT, hsTnI or cTnI was equally effec-
tive in risk-stratifying chest pain patients for safe discharge. The theoretical cut-off points yielding 100% sensitiv-ity are potentially useful (when achieved) for safely discharging low risk patients with undifferentiated chestpain in the ED.

1. Introduction
Chest pain is one of the leading presenting complaints in the emer-
gency department (ED) and constitutes approximately 5 –10% of visits
to the emergency department [ 1]. Annually in the United States, 8 –10
million of such patients consume USD $10 - $13 billion for evaluation
of possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI) yielding about a 15% diag-
nosis rate of con ﬁrmed AMI [ 2-5]. Due to medico-legal considerations
around safe discharge, the majority of chest pain patients are kept for
prolonged observation involving phlebotomy for serial cardiac markers
followed by stress testing or cardiac imaging. This strategy is supportedAmerican Journal of Emergency Medicine 38 (2020) 1560 –1567

by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Associa-
tion [ 6]. However, this practice leads to increased costs and ED
overcrowding which is associated with worse outcomes [ 7,8]. Further-
more, false positives occur when low-risk patients are evaluated with
unnecessary cardiac investigation [ 9].
The History, Electrocardiograph (ECG), Age, Risk, cardiac Troponin
(HEART) score, is a well-established widely validated risk-strati ﬁcation tool for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among pa-
tients presenting with undifferentiated chest pain at the ED, yielding ascore of 0 (very low risk) up to 10 (very high risk) [ 10,11]. Although
other studies have recently investigated the utility of a HEART Score in-corporating a high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) assay in the algorithm for
rapid rule out of AMI in the ED setting [ 12], this is the ﬁrst Asian cohort
that compares 3 troponin assays, i.e. hsTnT, hsTnI and a conventionalTnI (cTnI) applied in a modi ﬁed HEART score to look at safely
discharging low risk patients with a single blood draw.
The objective of this study was to determine the performance of a
modi ﬁed HEART score using a single blood draw of three different
cardiac troponin assays at presentation in predicting 30-day MACE.
The secondary objective was to establish local reference norms by
determining the cut-off point which yielded the highest sensitivity
and negative predictive value (NPV) for AMI and 30-day MACE for
each of the assays used. In this study, we evaluated hsTnT at
14 ng/L (being the 99th percentile URL as per manufacturer's recom-
mendation), as well as the current 30 ng/L as the cut-off for myocar-
dial necrosis. This study is also an opportunity to evaluate other cut
offs using troponin I in the analysis.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and population
This single-center cohort study prospectively consented chest pain
patients recruited from October 2015 –November 2017 at the ED. Pa-
tients were included if they were age 21 years and above, able to pro-
vide written consent, presented with a chief complaint of chest pain
to the ED and were deemed to be having symptoms suggestive of ACS
or angina equivalent, had a troponin test ordered in the ED, and were el-
igible for chest pain protocol. Patients were excluded if they were diag-
nosed with a clear-cut ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), had
poor pre-morbid conditions e.g. bed-ridden, or had terminal illness or
malignancy. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient
recruited in the ED following initial triage and exclusion of STEMI and
within 1 h of initial blood draw at presentation. This study was ap-
proved by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (cIRB).A standardized screening case report form (CRF) was used as a
data collection tool, which comprises clinical data such as chestpain status, exacerbating factors, relieving factors, symptom onset,
duration, radiation, characteristic, severity, current Canadian Car-
diovascular Score, associated symptoms, 12 ‑lead ECG at 0- and 2-
hour, ﬁnal diagnosis, disposition, medical history, oral concomitant
medication, laboratory results as well as risk strati ﬁcation scoring
systems (GRACE, HEART, TIMI and EDAC). These data were stored
digitally.
Data collection was done by the study coordinators who were re-
search of ﬁcers trained during the site initiation visit before the study
ofﬁcially commenced. They had further worked on the study prior to
commencement. New coordinators who subsequently came on
board were trained by existing ones before working on the study.
Nevertheless, all of them required ethics approval prior to handling
the study.
2.2. Investigational hsTn analysis
All patients presenting with chest pain had their blood sample taken
at presentation for hsTnT as per current standard of care. A serial blood
draw for hsTnT at 2 h after presentation was taken for patient with
suspected ACS but for the purpose of this study, only the 0-hour sample
was considered. Patients were consented for additional blood to be
drawn for hsTnI and cTnI. After centrifugation, sera were analysed for
hsTnT routinely on the Roche e602 analyser (Troponin T hs STAT). Spec-
imens for hsTnI (Abbott i2000SR; STAT high sensitive troponin-I) and
cTnI (Beckman Coulter DxI800; Access AccuTnI+3 reagent) analyses
were stored at -80 °C up to 1 month before analysis. The performanceo
f the assays claimed by the manufacturers for their Limits of Detection
(LoD; hsTnT-5 ng/L, hsTnI-2 ng/L and cTnI-10 ng/L) and LoQ (hsTnT-13 ng/L, hsTnI-10 ng/L and cTnI-20 ng/L) have been veri ﬁed mostly.
Test runs and analysis are based on valid calibration speci ﬁcations and
acceptable quality control on day of run.
Based on clinical experience with our local cohort, we have contin-
ued to use 30 ng/L for hsTnT assay as the cut-off granting the Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) is 13 ng/L and a 99th percentile upper limit of
14 ng/L in the healthy population. This was supported by Januzzi JL Jnr
et al. (2010) on the diagnostic accuracy of hsTnT assay and the cTnTassay in patients with angina pectoris without MI [ 13]; cTnT at 0.03
μg/L cut-off demonstrated a PPV-55% and NPV-94% and hsTnT at
13 ng/L yielded PPV-30% and NPV-96%. The study showed better out-
come with the use of cTnT at 0.01 μg/L (equivalent to hsTnT 30 ng/L
[14]) as it gave PPV-55% and NPV-95%.

2.3. Modi ﬁed HEART score criteria
Several prior studies have described the components of the conven-
tional HEART score, which includes history, ECG, age risk factors and a
conventional troponin. In this study, modi ﬁcation was made to thetroponin component by using a single blood draw of hsTn instead
of conventional troponins at presentation for Roche and Abbott tro-
ponin assays. Each of these components was assigned a score of 0 to
2(Table 1 ). For the history component, three chest pain criteria
were used, namely pain site, exacerbating factors and relieving fac-tors. Along with other components in the scoring system, these
scores were subsequently added to yield a composite score of0–10, which were calculated retrospectively by study investigators
for each patient. Patients were subsequently classi ﬁed into low
risk if the modi ﬁed HEART score is 3 or less and non-low risk if the
score is 4 –10.
2.4. Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of MACE –deﬁned as a
composite of AMI, unstable angina (UAP), stroke, all-cause mortality, per-
cutaneous intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),
during or within 30 days from index visit. The diagnosis of AMI was de-
ﬁned as recommended by current guidelines, i.e. the detection of a rise
and/or fall of cardiac troponins with at least one value above the 99th per-centile upper reference limit (URL) in addition to at least one of the fol-
lowing: 1) symptoms of ischemia; 2) new electrocardiogram (ECG)
changes of ST-T segments, new left bundle branch block or development
of pathological Q waves; 3) imaging evidence of new regional wall mo-
tion abnormality or loss of viable myocardium; and/or 4) identi ﬁcation
of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy [ 15]. UAP was
deﬁned as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the absence of bio-
chemical evidence of myocardial damage, i.e. normal troponin level andoften normal ECG ﬁnding for this study. The ﬁnal diagnosis for each pa-
tient was adjudicated by an independent cardiologist and an ED physi-cian, both of whom had access to all clinically-reported data of
recruited patients as documented in the electronic medical record includ-
ing history, physical examination ﬁndings, discharge summary, ECG re-
ports, lab results including hsTnT results (which is part of currentclinical practice to distinguish between NSTEMI from UAP), stress
test data, radiology tests, coronary angiography, provider and con-
sultant notes. However, they were blinded to hsTnI and cTnI results
for the purpose of this study. Patients were adjudicated into one of
the four diagnostic categories: 1) NSTEMI; 2) UAP; 3) Stable angina;
4) Non-cardiac chest pain. A second cardiologist was engaged to re-
view the adjudication in case of disagreement. Patients were
followed up via telephone and medical records for MACE informa-
tion at 30 days after discharge.
We also took the opportunity to evaluate the utility of a standalone
hsTnT assay in the absence of other clinical parameters and history.
Hence the secondary outcome in this study was to compare this againstincorporating hsTnT assay value into the modi ﬁed HEART score.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Clinical characteristics were summarized using mean ± standard
deviation (SD) for continuous data and proportion for categorical data.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, with
calculation of area under the curve (AUC) and estimation of sensitivity,speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value

(83.9%) agreed for additional blood draw for hsTnI and cTnI specimens.
However, no patient was lost to follow up. The patient ﬂow chart is illus-
trated in Fig. 1 , and the baseline patient characteristics are illustrated in
Table 2 .
Of the 1002 patients analysed, a total of 143 (14.3%) had MACE on
index admission (Table 3 ). Of the 859 discharged patients, 3 (0.4%) de-
veloped ACS within 30 days follow-up. Of the 143 patients who had
MACE on index visit, 78 (54.5%) patients were diagnosed to have UAP,
28 (35.9%) of whom had revascularization at index visit itself while 12
(15.4%) had either staged or re-revascularization done at 30 days.
Sixty (42.0%) patients were diagnosed with NSTEMI among those who
had MACE on index visit, 11 (18.3%) of whom had revascularization
done at index visit while 1 (1.7%) had staged revascularisation done at
30 days.
Patients with modi ﬁed HEART score of 3 or less (low risk) had signif-
icantly lower rate of MACE than those with score of 4 and above (non-
low risk) in all three assays ( pb0.0001) ( Table 4 ). For hsTnT
(b14 ng/L), the rate of MACE among low risk patient was signi ﬁcantly
much lower than that of non-low risk patients, i.e. 4.0% and 24.3% re-
spectively. Similarly, these rates were 4.4% and 24.95% for hsTnT
(b30 ng/L), 4.2% and 24.9% for hsTnI as well as 4.2% and 25.9% for cTnI.
Non-low risk group constituted approximately 85% of all 30-dayMACE across all assays, i.e. 87% by hsTnT ( b14 ng/L), 84.9% by hsTnT
(b30 ng/L), 85.5% by hsTnI and 85.8% by cTnI.
The performance of modi ﬁed HEART scores in predicting 30-day
MACE was comparable among the three assays ( Table 5 ). The hsTnT
assay ( b14 ng/L) yielded the highest sensitivity of 87.0% (80.4 –92%;
95% Cl), followed by cTnI, hsTnI and hsTnT ( b30 ng/L) assays at 85.8%
(78.9 –91.1%; 95% Cl), 85.5% (78.5 –90.9%; 95% Cl) and 84.9%
(78.1 –90.3%; 95% Cl) respectively. Speci ﬁcity was low across all assays,ranging from 53.7 to 56.7% at 95% CI. The PPVs were comparably lowamong all assays ranging from 24.3 to 25.9% at 95% CI, while the NPVs
were comparably high, with the highest yielded by hsTnT assay
(b14 ng/L) at 96.0% (93.9 –97.6%), followed by hsTnI and cTnI both at
95.8% (93.6 –97.4%), and hsTnT ( b30 ng/L) at 95.6% (93.5 –97.3%). ROC
curves for all assays showed no difference across the three assays
(Figs. 2-5 ), with AUC values in the range of 0.70 –0.71 at 95% CI.
Further analysis also showed that a modi ﬁed HEART score using a
single blood draw of either hsTnT (3.9 ng/L), hsTnI (0.9 ng/L) or cTnI(0.0 ng/L) at presentation could yield a sensitivity of 100% for 30-day
MACE ( Figs. 6-8 ). Proportion of patients having such low values of
these assays are illustrated in Table 6 .
A
comparison of the performance of modi ﬁed HEART score using
hsTnT assay to that of standalone hsTnT value in predicting 30-DayMACE, but only a slight difference was found between the two, i.e.
AUC value of 0.79 and 0.81 respectively ( Figs. 8-9 ).
4. Discussion
In a study on patients managed in an observation unit, Hartsell et al.,
reported false-positive rates of 42.9%, 66.7% and 75.0% for coronary
computed tomography angiography (CCTA), myocardial perfusion im-
aging and stress echocardiography respectively [ 9]. Hoffman et al., re-
ported that low-risk chest pain patients randomized to CCTA receivedN2.5 times more radiation exposure, although mean length of hospital
stay was reduced by 7.6 h and more were discharged directly from the
ED [16]. The increased radiation exposure from the increased use of
CCTA has been estimated to be associated with 2% of all cancers in theUS [17]. In light of the above, we advocate the use of a suitable and

reliable troponin assay as a ﬁrst line test to safely rule out AMI in the ED
setting.
Patients who attended ED with chest pain in our local setting with a
non-low risk ( N3) modi ﬁed HEART score had a 85% 30-day MACE rate
and should either be admitted or have a protocol for early rule out of un-
derlying symptomatic coronary artery disease within 48 h if they are
discharged from the ED. The PPVs and NPVs for all three assays whichwere approximately 25% and 96% respectively, were statistically non-
signiﬁcant between the assays.
Our institutional practice of using hsTnT b30 ng/L instead of b14 ng/L
shifted three patients from non-low risk into the low risk modi ﬁed
HEART score classi ﬁcation ( Table 4 ), dropping the assay sensitivity
from 87.0% to 84.9% although the NPV and PPV were not signi ﬁcantly al-
tered ( Table 5 ). Among 859 patients discharged at index visit, three
were not picked up by all three assays and suffered a 30-day MACE
(i.e. a 0.4% 30-day MACE with a single blood draw) –one with low
risk and two with non-low risk. It is worthy to note that the low-risk pa-tient missed had a normal ECG with unremarkable troponins on his
index visit, but in view of his symptomatology which included a left-
sided chest pain associated with diaphoresis, a myocardial perfusion
scan was done two days later which revealed moderate ischemia. The
patient had an adjudicated diagnosis of unstable angina. Thus, while
this patient was strictly not picked up on index visit, his ACS was picked
up relatively soon after his visit and not towards the end of the 30-day
window period.
The identi ﬁed required assay values for hsTnT, hsTnI and cTnI, for
which a 100% sensitivity was obtained with regards to safe discharge
of chest pain presenters were very low ( Figs. 5-7 ), which might notseem to be clinically meaningful initially. These levels are near orlower than the assays present LoDs, a performance not yet near the rou-
tine reportable quantitation levels needed. Akin to the development of
new generation assays for thyroid-stimulating hormone, the achievable
utility of troponins will have to wait for the next generation of high-
sensitivity troponin assays. However, as noted in Table 6 , a considerable
10–25% of chest pain presenters could be safely discharged with a single
assay value when combined with the modiﬁ ed HEART score at initial
presentation, thus reducing the patient load at the ED by potentiallyup to a quarter.
The slight difference between the performance of modi ﬁed HEART
score using hsTnT assay and that of standalone hsTnT value in
predicting 30-Day MACE ( Figs. 9-10 ) may seemingly imply that
standalone hsTnT value performs marginally better as compared to in-corporating it within a risk-scoring system. Nevertheless, by no means
are we advocating the use of biochemical markers alone in the absence
of clinical judgment involving synthesizing the patient's history and
physical ﬁndings to diagnose ACS. A remarkable example would be
the two non-low risk patients missed from the single blood draw at pre-sentation, which serves to further emphasize the importance of risk-

scoring system over sole reliance on biochemical markers alone for di-
agnosis of ACS. Further studies need to be done to explore the likely
cause of the seemingly better performance of standalone hsTnT value
as compared to its incorporation into a risk-scoring system.
This study was limited by its small sample size. Also, although all pa-
tients had hsTnT values at presentation, about 5% of patients had miss-
ing data on hsTnI assay levels due to insuf ﬁcient blood draw. There were
three cases requiring input of the second cardiologist to resolve dis-agreements between the two primary adjudicators. However, interob-
server disagreement was not formally measured.
In summary, the modi ﬁed HEART score using a single blood draw of
either hsTnT (either 14 or 30 ng/L), hsTnI or cTnI was equally effective in
risk stratifying chest pain patients for safe discharge. In view that hsTnT/I performed similarly to cTnI, it is seemingly implied that hsTnT may notbe as great compared to conventional test as it is touted to be. Although
none of the tests had very high AUC and speci ﬁcity, the theoretical cut-
off point which yielded 100% sensitivity and the highest NPV for AMIand 30-day MACE for each of these assays establishes the desired local
reference norms which are potentially useful for safely discharging
low risk patients with undifferentiated chest pain in the ED.
