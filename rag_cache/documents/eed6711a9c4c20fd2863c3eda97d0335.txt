Abstract
Mortality risk in COVID-19 patients is determined by several factors. The aim of our study was to adopt an integrated 
approach based on clinical, laboratory and chest x-ray (CXR) findings collected at the patient’s admission to Emergency 
Room (ER) to identify prognostic factors. Retrospective study on 346 consecutive patients admitted to the ER of two North-
Western Italy hospitals between March 9 and April 10, 2020 with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase reaction chain test (RT-PCR), CXR performed within 24 h (analyzed with two different scores) and 
recorded prognosis. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Statistical analysis on the features of 83 in-hospital dead 
vs 263 recovered patients was performed with univariate (uBLR), multivariate binary logistic regression (mBLR) and ROC 
curve analysis. uBLR identified significant differences for several variables, most of them intertwined by multiple correla-
tions. mBLR recognized as significant independent predictors for in-hospital mortality age > 75 years, C-reactive protein 
(CRP) > 60 mg/L,  PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 250 and CXR “Brixia score” > 7. Among the patients with at least two predictors, 
the in-hospital mortality rate was 58% against 6% for others [p  < 0.0001; RR = 7.6 (4.4–13)]. Patients over 75 years had 
three other predictors in 35% cases against 10% for others [p  < 0.0001, RR = 3.5 (1.9–6.4)]. The greatest risk of death from 
COVID-19 was age above 75 years, worsened by elevated CRP and CXR score and reduced P/F. Prompt determination of 
these data at admission to the emergency department could improve COVID-19 pretreatment risk stratification.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
Medical symptoms vary from asymptomatic inflammation  * Marco Gatti

to a wide range of systemic and/or respiratory manifesta-
tions, causing a mortality rate of about 2.4% according to 
the World Health Organization (WHO) [1 ]. Recent data 
suggest that the mortality risk is higher in patients with 
advanced age, presence of systemic comorbidities, inflam-
matory markers and extent of lung anomalies [2 –5]. An early 
and comprehensive assessment of all these parameters is 
therefore, crucial as soon as a suspected COVID-19 patient 
arrives to the emergency room.
Imaging plays a key role in the evaluation of COVID-19 
patients by assessing the extent of pulmonary involvement. 
Even if computed tomography (CT) is the technique with the 
highest sensitivity for the evaluation of the patient’s progno-
sis [6 –9], the Fleischner Society’s Multinational Consensus 
Statement [10] stated that the CT scan should not be used 
for screening or as a first-line diagnostic test for COVID-19, 
also because the use of a non-dedicated CT scanner requires 
time-consuming and laborious decontamination procedures 
to reduce the risk of cross-infection. Chest x-ray (CXR) suf-
fers from low sensitivity [11]; on the other hand, it has the 
advantage of the ease and speed of equipment cleaning and 
the wide availability of portable devices. Therefore, many 
radiological societies [12, 13] recommend the use of CXR as 
a first-line imaging tool in emergency departments, reserv -
ing specific roles for chest CT, as identifying typical features 
of COVID-19 pneumonia in selected cases. In this perspec-
tive, a few studies have evaluated the contribution of CXR 
to the prognostic assessment of patients with COVID-19 
[14–16], confirming that extensive lung involvement is asso-
ciated with several demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the patients leading to a worse prognosis.
Even if the evaluation of a patient admitted to an emer -
gency room includes a variety of clinical, laboratory and 
CXR findings, to the best of our knowledge there are no 
studies on how the entire set of these data and their relations 
impact on the early COVID-19 patient’s prognostic assess-
ment. We considered the issue worth of further exploration and planned a retrospective study based on an integrated 
approach to the data usually collected in ER to better define 
the comprehensive scenario behind the positive or negative 
outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Study design and population
The study, piloted in agreement with the 1964 Helsinki dec -
laration and its later amendments, was approved by the insti-
tutional review board. The requirement for informed patient 
consent was waived.
This was a retrospective two-center study on 448 consec-
utive patients admitted to the emergency department of two 
large North-Western Italy hospitals between March 9 and 
April 10, 2020, at the peak of the local Covid-19 pandemic 
outburst. The study flow chart is reported in Fig.  1. The 
final study sample was composed of 346 patients who met 
the inclusion criteria of: (1) clinical suspicion of COVID-
19 confirmed by RT-PCR, (2) CXR performed within 24 h 
of the swab execution, (3) official records of the prognosis.
The primary outcome variable was in-hospital mortality; 
primary predictors was the ER data on demographical, clini-
cal and laboratory parameters and CXR outcome.
Clinical and laboratory data
The clinical and laboratory data of the patients were col-
lected in accordance with the structured report released by 
the “Società Italiana di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica 
(SIRM)” [ 17]. Comorbidities included in the analysis were: 
presence of diabetes, obesity (i.e. BMI > 30), hypertension, 
smoke history, ACEi/Sartan or FANS therapy. As for clini-
cal data: fever, cough, rhinitis, dyspnea, anosmia, dysgeusia, 
pharyngodynia, myalgias, asthenia, conjunctivitis, headache,

nausea, vomit and diarrhea. Regarding laboratory data: 
white blood cells (WBC) count (neutrophils, lymphocytes), 
procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehy -
drogenase (LDH), hepatic enzymes, creatine kinase (CK), 
blood pH and arterial partial pressure of oxygen  (PaO2) and 
carbon dioxide  (PaCO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen 
 (FiO2). Moreover, we calculated the neutrophil–to-lympho-
cyte ratio (NLR), the alveolar–arterial gradient (A–a gradi-
ent) and the  PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F). The RT-PCR protocol 
included extraction with  QIAsymphony® DSP Virus/Patho-
gen Midi Kit and amplification with Seegene AllplexTM 
2019-nCoV Assay (target genes E, N, RdRP).
Image acquisition and analysis
CXRs were acquired as computerized or digital radio -
graphs following the local protocols. All CXR studies were 
analyzed by two observers (MC and MG with more than 
5 years’ experience) using a picture archiving and commu-
nication system (PACS) workstation [Carestream Vue PACS 
v11.3.4 (Carestream Health, Inc, Rochester, NY)]. In the few 
cases of disagreement, the decision was reached by consulta-
tion with a senior radiologist (RF with more than 10 years’ 
experience).
CXRs were evaluated using two separate scores: the first 
[14] measured the involvement of each lung field (upper, 
middle and lower) in a binary manner, ranging from 0 to 
6; whereas, the second, the so-called “Brixia score” [18], 
assessed the severity of the involvement of each lung field 
on a scale from 0 to 3, for a total score from 0 to 18. The 
presence of pleural effusion and reduction of lung volumes 
were also evaluated.
Statistical analysis
The first step of the statistical analysis of the set of data 
included univariate tests. Continuous variables were checked 
for normality with the Shapiro–Wilks W test. Age was nor -
mal and was thus expressed as mean and standard deviation. 
Normality was rejected for all other data, which were thus 
expressed as median with first (Q1) and third (Q3) quar -
tile; categorical variables were presented as absolute num-
bers and percentages. Univariate binary logistic regression 
(uBLR) was run on all variables, with an outcome expressed 
by the beta coefficient, which describes the size and the 
direction of the relationship between predictor and the 
response variable (in this case in-hospital mortality), p  value 
and odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Continuous variables with significant differences assessed 
by uBLR were tested for their ability to discriminate between 
event and no-event by means of the ROC curve [plot of sen -
sitivity vs (1 − specificity)]. Only variables for which the 
area under the curve (AUC) was ≥ 0.80, corresponding to good discrimination (AUC  = 0.50 corresponds to chance) 
were dichotomized, setting the threshold at the value which 
satisfied the triple condition of: (1) maximization of the 
harmonic mean of sensitivity (SNS) and specificity (SPC), 
(2) maximation of Youden’s index (SNS + SPSC-1), and (3) 
minimization of the distance of the curve from the upper left 
corner (SNS = SPC = 1).
The dichotomous and dichotomized variables determined 
significant by the univariate analysis were then analyzed 
with a multivariate binary logistic regression (mBLR) to 
adjust for correlations between variables and extract the 
independent significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.
Correlation between variables was studied with the non-
parametric Spearman correlation coefficient rho (range 
− 1:1).
Significance corresponded to p  < 0.05 and 95% CI for RR 
and OR not including 1; 95% CI > 1 and beta > 0 indicated 
risk of the event; whereas, 95% CI < 1 and beta < 0 indicated 
protection.
The analysis was run on StatPlus: Mac v.7 (AnalysisSoft.
Walnut.CA,USA).
Results
The study sample of 346 patients was subdivided in two 
groups according to their final prognosis: patients who died 
during hospitalization ( n = 83) and patients discharged after 
recovery (n  = 263).
The baseline characteristics, comorbidities, clinical, labo-
ratory and radiological data of the two groups are reported in 
Table  1 (Comorbidity, clinical, laboratory and radiological 
data of death vs. recovery COVID-19 patients),  subdivided 
for major clarity in four sections: I_Comorbidities, II_Clini-
cal data, III_Laboratory data and IV_CRX. The results of 
the uBLR evidenced several significant differences between 
the two groups.
The continuous variables with significant differences 
were tested for their ability to discriminate between in-hos-
pital death and recovery by computing their ROC curve. 
Age, CXR simplified score, CXR Brixia score, P/F, A–a 
gradient, NLR, CRP, procalcitonin, WBC,  PO2 and LDH, 
had AUC values between 0.75 and 0.90 (see Fig.  2) and 
were thus dichotomized. Both X-ray scores were signifi-
cantly different between patients with good and bad prog-
nosis (p  < 0.0001), but the “Brixia score” had a slightly 
greater discriminating capacity than the simplified score 
(AUC = 0.81 vs. 0.79, p = 0.046). The dichotomization pro-
cedure determined as regions associated with significantly 
increased risk of in-hospital mortality: age  > 75 years, 
Brixia score > 7, P/F < 250, A–a gradient > 50 mmHg, 
NLR > 4, CRP > 60 mg/L, procalcitonin > 0.20 ng/mL, 
WBC > 10 ×  109/L,  PO2 < 65 mmHg and LDH  ≥ 400 UI/L.

The results on the dichotomized variable are reported in 
Table  1 in the line under the correspondent continuous one.
The mBLR run on the ensemble of dichotomous or 
dichotomized variables determined significant by univari-
ate analysis yielded four independent significant predic-
tors for in-hospital mortality: age > 75 years, Brixia > 7, 
P/F < 250 and CRP > 60 mg/L. Their number was limited 
by the intricate pattern of correlations among the vari-
ables of Table  1. As examples, age > 75 is directly cor -
related with hypertension (rho = 0.24), diabetes (0.18), 
oncological history (0.28), A–a gradient > 50 mmHg (0.24) 
and  PO2 < 65 mmHg (0.30); Brixia > 7 is correlated with LDH > 400 (0.39), procalcitonin > 0.20 ng/mL (0.30) and 
NLR > 4 (0.30); CRP > 60 is correlated with  PO2 < 65 mmHg 
(0.46) and LDH > 400UI/L (0.44); finally, P/F < 250 cor -
relates with A–a gradient > 50 mmHg (0.60) and with 
 PO2 < 65 mmHg(0.26). The main parameters of the mBLR 
outcome for the four independent predictors and two protec-
tors are reported in Table  2 (outcome of multivariate binary 
logistic regression: predictors and protectors of in-hospital 
mortality) and show that age > 75 years was the factor most 
heavily associated with in-hospital mortality.
The total number of independent prognostic factors diag-
nosed for each patient was NTOT = 1(0–2). The distributions Significant differences were reported in italics

discriminating ability of NTOT is shown in Fig.  3, bottom

Discussion
Our study investigated the relationship of the set of demo-
graphics, clinical, laboratory and CXR data of 346 patients 
with COVID-19 as collected at their admission to the ER 
with their final prognosis (83 dead and 263 recovered). The 
intra-hospital mortality rate of 23% is in line with a recent 
meta-analysis that analyzed 60 studies and 51,225 hospital-
ized patients finding an in-hospital mortality rate of 24.3% 
[19].
Multivariate analysis determined the existence of 
four independent predictors for in-hospital mortality: 
age > 75 years, CRP > 60 mg/L, P/F < 250 and CXR “Brixia 
score” > 7. All these predictors had significant direct cor -
relations with several other variables with prognostic value 
at the univariate analysis. The key finding was that a patient 
with a number of prognostic predictors NTOT ≥ 2 had an 
eightfold higher risk of in-hospital mortality than patients 
with a minor number of predictors (58% vs 6%, p  < 0.0001).The result on age agrees with previous studies [5 , 15, 
20–22]. Older age is significantly associated with an 
increasing presence of several comorbidities such as diabe-
tes, hypertension, oncological history, cardiovascular and 
kidney diseases, each of which tends to enhance the death 
risk. In particular, the age range > 75 years we determined 
associated with the worst prognosis is consistent with the 
data of Borghesi et al. [15], who identified in a population 
of the same ethnicity and with similar socio-demographic 
characteristics a cut-off of 71 years.
Among laboratory parameters, regression analysis 
showed elevated CRP values and low P/F (in our sample 
of patients, respectively, > 60 mg/L and < 250) as predic-
tors for worse prognosis. An elevation of the concentration 
of CRP is often observed in COVID-19 patients. The study 
of Guan et al. [5 ] found that laboratory parameters that 
assessed inflammation and cell damage, such as CRP, were 
significantly higher in patients with a severe disease than 
in patients with a non-severe disease. CRP level signifi-
cantly increases in COVID-19 patients due to inflamma -
tory reaction and tissue destruction. High concentrations 
of CRP were reported to indicate more severe illness-cor -
related with lung damage and worse prognosis [21, 23].
The severity of respiratory failure appears to be the 
driving force behind the prognosis of COVID-19. Indeed, 
the clinical situation in the advanced stages of COVID19 is 
that of hypoxemic respiratory failure (hypo or hypercapnic 
depending on the phase and comorbidities). This results 
in severe arterial hypoxemia refractory to supplementary 
 O2 therapy. The cause is the formation of intrapulmonary 
shunts as a result of interstitial involvement. This is also 
confirmed by our finding on the direct correlation between 
Brixia score and A–a gradient and the inverse correla-
tion between Brixia score and P/F (Brixia vs A–a gradient 
Fig. 4  a 62-Year-old man who had the following values for the 
risk predictors when admitted to the emergency room: P/F = 417, 
CRP = 25.6  mg/L and Brixia score 2. Overall, the patient had no 
risk factor and he was discharged after recovery without the need of 
intensive care unit. b 67-Year-old man who had the following values: P/F = 314, CRP = 92.3 mg/L and Brixia score 7. Overall, the patient 
had one risk factor and was discharged after discharged after need of 
the intensive care unit. c 87-Year-old female who had the following 
values: P/F = 262, CRP = 91.2 mg/L and Brixia score 13. Overall, the 
patients had three risk factors and died during hospitalization

rho = 0.27, vs P/F rho = − 0.36; Brixia > 7 vs P/F < 250, 
rho = 0.29). Our data confirmed P/F as an independent 
parameter for determining the severity and prognosis of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome [24]. The importance 
of P/F in these patients was recently stressed by Kishaba 
et al. [25], who demonstrated that serial monitoring of P/F 
was useful for predicting short-term prognosis in COVID-
19 patients. [25]
Regarding radiological data, our study confirmed the use-
fulness of CXR classification as a prognostic factor, with 
a greater extension of lung involvement corresponding to 
a worse prognosis [14– 16]. Toussie et al. [14] evaluated 
demographic, clinical and radiological data, without includ-
ing laboratory data, and firstly demonstrated that baseline 
CXR, when using a lung zone severity score, could pre -
dict outcomes in young and middle-aged adults affected by 
COVID-19. In their study, the radiological score together 
with obesity resulted predictor of hospitalization, while 
only the radiologic score was predictor of hospitalization in 
intensive care; however, the impact of these data on the final 
outcome of the patients was not evaluated.
Another CXR score created for COVID-19 is the so-
called Brixia score [15], first used for predicting the risk 
of intra-hospital mortality in a sample of 302 patients; 
Brixia score over 8 and age over 71 were associated with an 
increased risk of intra-hospital mortality, but without consid-
ering the laboratory data. In our study, we tested both scores 
and observed that the Brixia score, even if more complex, 
was more discriminating than the score proposed by Toussie 
et al. [14], and was therefore, chosen to be inserted among 
the predictors as Brixia score > 7.
Two of the variables analyzed appeared to be protec -
tive factors. First of all, a short time lapse between onset 
of symptoms and CXR theoretically correspond to an early 
diagnosis (since the CXR was made less than 24 h from 
RT-PCR) which is often synonymous with early treatment 
and was associated with a better prognosis in COVID19 
patients: in particular, Huang et al. [26] found a positive 
correlation of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis 
and treatment and the time to disease resolution. Second, the 
presence of coughing, one of the most prevalent symptoms 
in COVID-19, resulted a protective factor, this data is in 
accordance with the recent meta-analysis of Mesas et al. [19] 
who reported an OR of 0.7 for COVID19 patient with cough.
This study has some limitations. The first is being a ret-
rospective study on a relatively limited number of patients, 
even if it is one of largest in the literature dealing with the 
complex relation between clinical, laboratory, CXR and 
prognosis. The second is the lack of an external validation 
on different samples of patients.
In conclusion, our research indicates a set of early prog-
nostic data for improving the COVID-19 pretreatment 
risk stratification. Even if the greatest risk of death from COVID-19 is aged above 75 years, elevated CXR score, 
high CRP levels and a low P/F at admission to the emer -
gency department represent significant prognostic factors. 
A patient admitted to the emergency department with ≥ 2 
predictors should immediately undergo intensive and aggres-
sive treatments to reduce the risk of a more severe course of 
the disease, which may otherwise lead to an eightfold higher 
in-hospital mortality rate than for patients with a lower num-
ber of predictors.
