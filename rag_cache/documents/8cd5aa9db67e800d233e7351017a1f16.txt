Preamble
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American 
Heart Association (AHA) are committed to the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases through professional education and research for clinicians, providers, and patients. Since 1980, the ACC and AHA have shared a responsibility to translate scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) with recommendations to standardize and improve cardiovascular health. These CPGs, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a corner -
stone of quality cardiovascular care.
In response to published reports from the Institute of 
Medicine
1,2 and the ACC/AHA’s mandate to evaluate new 
knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the 
ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force) 
began modifying its methodology. This modernization effort 
is published in the 2012 Methodology Summit Report3 and 
2014 perspective article.4 The latter recounts the history of 
the collaboration, changes over time, current policies, and

planned initiatives to meet the needs of an evolving health-
care environment. Recommendations on value in proportion 
to resource utilization will be incorporated as high-quality comparative-effectiveness data become available.
5 The rela-
tionships between CPGs and data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere.
4
Intended Use–CPGs provide recommendations applicable 
to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. 
The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but CPGs 
developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although CPGs may be used to inform regula-
tory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve the quality of 
care and be aligned with the patient’s best interest.
Evidence Review–Guideline writing committee (GWC) 
members are charged with reviewing the literature; weighing the strength and quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimating expected health 
outcomes when data exist. In analyzing the data and develop-
ing CPGs, the GWC uses evidence-based methodologies devel-
oped by the Task Force.
6 A key component of the ACC/AHA 
CPG methodology is the development of recommendations on 
the basis of all available evidence. Literature searches focus 
on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include regis-
tries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. 
Only selected references are cited in the CPG. To ensure that 
CPGs remain current, new data are reviewed biannually by the GWCs and the Task Force to determine if recommendations 
should be updated or modified. In general, a target cycle of 5 
years is planned for full revisions.
1
Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy–Recognizing 
advances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovas-
cular diseases, the Task Force designated the term “guideline-
directed medical therapy” (GDMT) to represent recommended medical therapy as defined mainly by Class I measures, gen-
erally a combination of lifestyle modification and drug- and 
device-based therapeutics. As medical science advances, GDMT evolves, and hence GDMT is preferred to “optimal medical therapy.” For GDMT and all other recommended drug 
treatment regimens, the reader should confirm the dosage with 
product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindi-cations and possible drug interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical 
use in the United States.
Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence–Once 
recommendations are written, the Class of Recommendation 
(COR; ie, the strength the GWC assigns to the recommen-dation, which encompasses the anticipated magnitude and judged certainty of benefit in proportion to risk) is assigned by the GWC. Concurrently, the Level of Evidence (LOE) 
rates the scientific evidence supporting the effect of the 
intervention on the basis on the type, quality, quantity, and 
consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports 
(Table 1).
4 Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are 
presented in order by the COR and then the LOE. Where 
comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. 
When more than 1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and there are no comparative data, 
options are listed alphabetically.Relationships With Industry and Other Entities–The 
ACC and AHA exclusively sponsor the work of GWCs with-
out commercial support, and members volunteer their time for this activity. The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise 
through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). 
All GWC members and reviewers are required to fully dis-close current industry relationships or personal interests from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced GWC and requires that both the chair and a majority of GWC members have no rel-evant RWI (see Appendix 1 for the definition of relevance). GWC members are restricted with regard to writing or voting 
on sections to which their RWI apply. In addition, for trans-
parency, GWC members’ comprehensive disclosure informa-
tion is available as an online supplement. Comprehensive 
disclosure information for the Task Force is available as an additional supplement. The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds repre-senting different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, races, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical prac-tice. Selected organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators.
Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated 
Conditions and Comorbidities–The ACC and AHA recog-nize the complexity of managing patients with multiple condi-tions, compared with managing patients with a single disease, and the challenge is compounded when CPGs for evaluation or treatment of several coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting.
7 CPGs attempt to define practices that meet the 
needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and do not replace clinical judgment.
Clinical Implementation–Management in accordance with 
CPG recommendations is effective only when followed; there-fore, to enhance their commitment to treatment and compliance with lifestyle adjustment, clinicians should engage the patient to participate in selecting interventions on the basis of the patient’s individual values and preferences, taking associated conditions and comorbidities into consideration (eg, shared decision making). Consequently, there are circumstances in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.
The recommendations in this CPG are the official policy of 
the ACC and AHA until they are superseded by a published addendum, focused update, or revised full-text CPG.

1. Introduction
1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review
The recommendations listed in this CPG are, whenever pos-sible, evidence based. An extensive evidence review was conducted through October 2012, and other selected refer -
ences published through April 2014 were reviewed by the GWC. Literature included was derived from research involv-ing human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane 
Library, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Reports,

and other selected databases relevant to this CPG. The rel-
evant data are included in evidence tables in the Online Data 
Supplement. Key search words included but were not limited 
to the following: acute coronary syndrome, anticoagulant 
therapy, antihypertensives, anti-ischemic therapy, antiplatelet therapy, antithrombotic therapy, beta blockers, biomarkers, 
calcium channel blockers, cardiac rehabilitation, conserva-
tive management, diabetes mellitus, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, heart failure, invasive strategy, lifestyle modifica-
tion, myocardial infarction, nitrates, non-ST-elevation, P2Y
12 
receptor inhibitor, percutaneous coronary intervention, renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, secondary prevention, 
smoking cessation, statins, stent, thienopyridines, troponins, unstable angina, and weight management. Additionally, the 
GWC reviewed documents related to non-ST-elevation acute 
coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) previously published by 
the ACC and AHA. References selected and published in this 
document are representative and not all-inclusive.
1.2. Organization of the GWC
The GWC was composed of clinicians, cardiologists, inter -
nists, interventionists, surgeons, emergency medicine special-ists, family practitioners, and geriatricians. The GWC included 
representatives from the ACC and AHA, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency 
Physicians, American College of Physicians, Society for Table 1.  Applying Classification of Recommendations and Level of Evidence
 
A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the clinical practice 
guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or 
therapy is useful or effective.
*Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as sex, age, history of diabetes mellitus, history of prior 
myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use.
†For comparative-effectiveness recommendations (Class I and IIa; Level of Evidence A and B only), studies that support the use of comparator verbs should involve 
direct comparisons of the treatments or strategies being evaluated.

1.4. Scope of the CPG
The 2014 NSTE-ACS CPG is a full revision of the 2007 
ACCF/AHA CPG for the management of patients with unsta-
ble angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (NSTEMI) and the 2012 focused update.8 The new title, 
“Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes,” emphasizes 
the continuum between UA and NSTEMI. At presentation, 
patients with UA and NSTEMI can be indistinguishable and are therefore considered together in this CPG.
In the United States, NSTE-ACS affects >625 000 patients 
annually,* or almost three fourths of all patients with acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS).
9 In selecting the initial approach to 
care, the term “ischemia-guided strategy” has replaced the pre-vious descriptor, “initial conservative management,” to more 
clearly convey the physiological rationale of this approach.
The task of the 2014 GWC was to establish a contempo-
rary CPG for the optimal management of patients with NSTE-ACS. It incorporates both established and new evidence from published clinical trials, as well as information from basic 
science and comprehensive review articles. These recommen-
dations were developed to guide the clinician in improving 
outcomes for patients with NSTE-ACS. Table 2 lists docu-
ments deemed pertinent to this effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating the need to repeat extant CPG 
recommendations.
The GWC abbreviated the discussion sections to include an 
explanation of salient information related to the recommenda-tions. In contrast to textbook declaratory presentations, expla-
nations were supplemented with evidence tables. The GWC 
also provided a brief summary of the relevant recommenda-tions and references related to secondary prevention rather 
than detailed reiteration. Throughout, the goal was to provide 
the clinician with concise, evidence-based contemporary rec-
ommendations and the supporting documentation to encour -
age their application.2. Overview Of ACS
2.1. Definition of Terms
ACS has evolved as a useful operational term that refers 
to a spectrum of conditions compatible with acute myocar -
dial ischemia and/or infarction that are usually due to an abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow (Figure 1). A key branch point is ST-segment elevation (ST-elevation) or new 
left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram (ECG), 
which is an indication for immediate coronary angiography to determine if there is an indication for reperfusion ther -
apy to open a likely completely occluded coronary artery. Separate CPGs have been developed for ST-elevation myo-cardial infarction (STEMI).
17
The absence of persistent ST-elevation is suggestive of NSTE-
ACS (except in patients with true posterior myocardial infarc-tion [MI], Sections 3.3.2.4, 4.3.2, and 7.2.2). NSTE-ACS can be further subdivided on the basis of cardiac biomarkers of necro-sis (eg, cardiac troponin, Sections 3.2.4 and 3.4). If cardiac bio-
markers are elevated and the clinical context is appropriate, the 
patient is considered to have NSTEMI
34; otherwise, the patient 
is deemed to have UA. ST depression, transient ST-elevation, 
and/or prominent T-wave inversions may be present but are 
not required for a diagnosis of NSTEMI. Abnormalities on the ECG and elevated troponins in isolation are insufficient to make the diagnosis of ACS but must be interpreted in the appropri-ate clinical context. Thus, UA and NSTEMI are closely related 
conditions whose pathogenesis and clinical presentations are 
similar but vary in severity. The conditions differ primarily by whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause myocardial damage leading to detectable quantities of myocardial injury biomarkers. The term “possible ACS” is often assigned during initial evaluation if the ECG is unrevealing and troponin data are not yet available. UA can present without any objective data 
of myocardial ischemic injury (normal ECG and normal tropo-
nin), in which case the initial diagnosis depends solely on the patient’s clinical history and the clinician’s interpretation and judgment. However, with the increasing sensitivity of troponin assays, biomarker-negative ACS (ie, UA) is becoming rarer.
39 
The pathogenesis of ACS is considered in the “Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.”

MI caused by a primary coronary artery process such as spon-taneous plaque rupture as MI type 1 and one related to reduced myocardial oxygen supply and/or increased myocardial oxygen demand (in the absence of a direct coronary artery process) as a MI type 2 (Appendix 4, Table A and Section 3.4 for an addi-tional discussion on the diagnosis of MI).
2.2. Epidemiology and Pathogenesis
2.2.1. EpidemiologyIn the United States, the median age at ACS presentation is 68 years (interquartile range 56 to 79), and the male-to-female 
ratio is approximately 3:2.
40 Some patients have a history of 
stable angina, whereas in others, ACS is the initial presenta-
tion of coronary artery disease (CAD). It is estimated that in the United States, each year, >780 000 persons will experience 
an ACS. Approximately 70% of these will have NSTE-ACS.
9 
Patients with NSTE-ACS typically have more comorbidities, both cardiac and noncardiac, than patients with STEMI.

2.2.2. Pathogenesis
The hallmark of ACS is the sudden imbalance between myo-
cardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and demand, which is 
usually the result of coronary artery obstruction. The imbalance 
may also be caused by other conditions, including excessive myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of a stable flow-lim-
iting lesion; acute coronary insufficiency due to other causes (eg, vasospastic [Prinzmetal] angina [Section 7.11], coronary embolism, coronary arteritis); noncoronary causes of myo-
cardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (eg, hypotension, severe anemia, hypertension, tachycardia, hypertrophic car -
diomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis); nonischemic myocardial injury (eg, myocarditis, cardiac contusion, cardiotoxic drugs); 
and multifactorial causes that are not mutually exclusive (eg, 
stress [Takotsubo] cardiomyopathy [Section 7.13], pulmonary 
embolism, severe heart failure [HF], sepsis).

Figure 1. Acute Coronary Syndromes. The top half of the figure illustrates the progression of plaque formation and onset and 
complications of NSTE-ACS, with management at each stage. The numbered section of an artery depicts the process of atherogenesis 
from 1) normal artery to 2) extracellular lipid in the subintima to 3) fibrofatty stage to 4) procoagulant expression and weakening of the fibrous cap. ACS develops with 5) disruption of the fibrous cap, which is the stimulus for thrombogenesis. 6) Thrombus resorption may be  
followed by collagen accumulation and smooth muscle cell growth. Thrombus formation and possible coronary vasospasm reduce blood flow in the affected coronary artery and cause ischemic chest pain. The bottom half of the figure illustrates the clinical, pathological, electrocardiographic, and biomarker correlates in ACS and the general approach to management. Flow reduction may be related to a completely occlusive thrombus (bottom half, right side) or subtotally occlusive thrombus (bottom half, left side). Most patients with ST-elevation (thick white arrow in bottom panel) develop QwMI, and a few (thin white arrow) develop NQMI. Those without ST-elevation have either UA or NSTEMI (thick red arrows), a distinction based on cardiac biomarkers. Most patients presenting with NSTEMI develop NQMI; a few may develop QwMI. The spectrum of clinical presentations including UA, NSTEMI, and STEMI is referred to as ACS. This NSTE-ACS CPG includes sections on initial management before NSTE-ACS, at the onset of NSTE-ACS, and during the hospital phase. Secondary prevention and plans for long-term management begin early during the hospital phase. Patients with noncardiac etiologies make up the largest group presenting to the ED with chest pain (dashed arrow). *Elevated cardiac biomarker (eg, troponin), Section

outcome(s) to decide on the need for hospitalization 
and assist in the selection of treatment options.42–44 
(Level of Evidence: B)
Patients with suspected ACS must be evaluated rapidly to 
identify those with a life-threatening emergency versus those 
with a more benign condition. The goal of the initial evalua-
tion focuses on answering 2 questions:
1. What is the likelihood that the symptoms and signs rep-
resent ACS?
2. What is the likelihood of adverse clinical outcome(s)?
Risk assessment scores and clinical prediction algorithms 
using clinical history, physical examination, ECG, and car -
diac troponins have been developed to help identify patients 
with ACS at increased risk of adverse outcome(s). Common risk assessment tools include the TIMI (Thrombolysis In 
Myocardial Infarction) risk score,
42 the PURSUIT (Platelet 
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy) risk score,
43 the 
GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score,
44 and the NCDR-ACTION (National Cardiovascular 
Data Registry-Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) registry (https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/action/). These assessment tools have been applied with vari-
able efficacy to predict outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with undifferentiated chest pain 
(“pain” encompasses not only pain, but also symptoms such as 
discomfort, pressure, and squeezing).
45–48 The Sanchis score,49 
Vancouver rule,50 Heart (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, 
and Troponin) score,51 HEARTS3 score,52 and Hess prediction 
rule53 were developed specifically for patients in the ED with 
chest pain. Although no definitive study has demonstrated the 
superiority of risk assessment scores or clinical prediction 
rules over clinician judgment, determination of the level of 
risk on initial evaluation is imperative to guide patient man-
agement, including the need for additional diagnostic testing 
and treatment. See Section 3.2.2 for a discussion of risk strati-
fication variables.
See Online Data Supplement 1 for additional information 
on clinical assessment and initial evaluation.
3.1.1. ED or Outpatient Facility Presentation: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. Patients with suspected ACS and high-risk features 
such as continuing chest pain, severe dyspnea, syn-cope/presyncope, or palpitations should be referred 
immediately to the ED and transported by emer -
gency medical services when available. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIb
1. Patients with less severe symptoms may be considered 
for referral to the ED, a chest pain unit, or a facility capable of performing adequate evaluation depend-
ing on clinical circumstances. (Level of Evidence: C)Patients with suspected ACS and high-risk features should be 
transported to the ED by emergency medical services when 
available. Hospitals and outpatient facilities should provide 
clearly visible signage directing patients transported by pri-vate vehicle to the appropriate triage area. Outpatient facili-ties should have the capacity for ECG and cardiac troponin measurements with immediate ED referral for those consid-ered to have ACS.
3.2. Diagnosis of NSTE-ACS
Differential diagnosis of NSTE-ACS includes41:
•	Nonischemic cardiovascular causes of chest pain (eg, 
aortic dissection, expanding aortic aneurysm, pericardi-tis, pulmonary embolism)
•	Noncardiovascular causes of chest, back, or upper abdominal discomfort include:
 ◦Pulmonary causes (eg, pneumonia, pleuritis, pneumothorax)
 ◦Gastrointestinal causes (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal spasm, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, biliary 
disease)
 ◦Musculoskeletal causes (eg, costochondritis, cervical 
radiculopathy)
 ◦Psychiatric disorders
 ◦Other etiologies (eg, sickle cell crisis, herpes zoster)
In addition, the clinician should differentiate NSTE-ACS 
from acute coronary insufficiency due to a nonatherosclerotic 
cause and noncoronary causes of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch
41 (Section 2.2.2).
3.2.1. History
NSTE-ACS most commonly presents as a pressure-type chest 
pain that typically occurs at rest or with minimal exertion lasting ≥10 minutes.
41 The pain most frequently starts in the 
retrosternal area and can radiate to either or both arms, the 
neck, or the jaw. Pain may also occur in these areas indepen-
dent of chest pain. Patients “with NSTE-ACS may also present with diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain, or syn-cope. Unexplained new-onset or increased exertional dyspnea is the most common angina equivalent. Less common presen-tations include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, unexplained fatigue, and syncope. Factors that increase the probability of 
NSTE-ACS are older age, male sex, positive family history of 
CAD, and the presence of peripheral arterial disease, diabe-tes mellitus, renal insufficiency, prior MI, and prior coronary revascularization. Although older patients (≥ 75 years of age) 
and women usually present with typical symptoms of ACS, 
the frequency of atypical presentations is increased in these 
groups as well as in patients with diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, and dementia.
54,55 Atypical symptoms, includ-
ing epigastric pain, indigestion, stabbing or pleuritic pain, and increasing dyspnea in the absence of chest pain should raise concern for NSTE-ACS.
56 Psychiatric disorders (eg, somato-
form disorders, panic attack, anxiety disorders) are noncardiac 
causes of chest pain that can mimic ACS.57
3.2.2. Physical Examination
The physical examination in NSTE-ACS can be normal, but 
signs of HF should expedite the diagnosis and treatment of

this condition. Acute myocardial ischemia may cause a S4, a 
paradoxical splitting of S2, or a new murmur of mitral regur -
gitation due to papillary muscle dysfunction. However, these 
signs may also exist without NSTE-ACS and thus are nonspe-cific. The coupling of pain on palpation suggesting musculo-skeletal disease or inflammation with a pulsatile abdominal 
mass suggesting abdominal aortic aneurysm raises concern 
for nonischemic causes of NSTE-ACS. The physical exami-nation can indicate alternative diagnoses in patients with chest 
pain, several of which are life threatening. Aortic dissection 
is suggested by back pain, unequal palpated pulse volume, a 
difference of ≥15 mm Hg between both arms in systolic blood 
pressure (BP), or a murmur of aortic regurgitation. Acute peri-carditis is suggested by a pericardial friction rub. Cardiac tam-
ponade can be reflected by pulsus paradoxus. Pneumothorax 
is suspected when acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and dif-ferential breath sounds are present. A pleural friction rub may indicate pneumonitis or pleuritis.
3.2.3. Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead ECG should be performed and interpreted within 
10 minutes of the patient’s arrival at an emergency facility to assess for cardiac ischemia or injury.
21 Changes on ECG 
in patients with NSTE-ACS include ST depression, tran-sient ST-elevation, or new T-wave inversion.
21,58 Persistent 
ST-elevation or anterior ST depression indicative of true pos-terior MI should be treated according to the STEMI CPG.
17 
The ECG can be relatively normal or initially nondiagnostic; if this is the case, the ECG should be repeated (eg, at 15- to 30-minute intervals during the first hour), especially if symp-
toms recur.
21 A normal ECG does not exclude ACS and occurs 
in 1% to 6% of such patients.59–61 A normal ECG may also be 
associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlu-
sions, which can be electrically silent (in which case posterior 
electrocardiographic leads [V7 to V9] may be helpful). Right-
sided leads (V3R to V4R) are typically performed in the case of 
inferior STEMI to detect evidence of right ventricular infarc-
tion. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, bundle-branch blocks with repolarization abnormalities, and ventricular pacing may 
mask signs of ischemia/injury.
62
3.2.4. Biomarkers of Myocardial Necrosis
Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and specific biomark-ers for NSTE-ACS. They rise within a few hours of symptom 
onset and typically remain elevated for several days (but may 
remain elevated for up to 2 weeks with a large infarction). A negative cardiac troponin obtained with more sensitive cardiac troponin assays on admission confers a >95% nega-tive predictive value for MI compared with high-sensitivity assays that confer a negative predictive value ≥ 99%.
63–65 See 
Section 3.4 for a detailed review of biomarkers for the diag-nosis of MI.
3.2.5. Imaging
A chest roentgenogram is useful to identify potential pulmo-nary causes of chest pain and may show a widened mediasti-num in patients with aortic dissection. Computed tomography 
(CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast can help exclude 
pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. Transthoracic 
echocardiography can identify a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology and may also be useful to detect 
regional wall motion abnormalities. Transesophageal echocar -
diography can identify a proximal aortic dissection. In low-risk patients with chest pain, coronary CT angiography can result in a more rapid, more cost-effective diagnosis than stress myocar -
dial perfusion imaging.
66
3.3. Prognosis–Early Risk Stratification: 
Recommendations
See Table 4 for a summary of recommendations from this 
section.
Class I
1. In patients with chest pain or other symptoms sug-
gestive of ACS, a 12-lead ECG should be performed 
and evaluated for ischemic changes within 10 min-
utes of the patient’s arrival at an emergency facility.21 
(Level of Evidence: C)
2. If the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and there is a high clinical sus-picion for ACS, serial ECGs (eg, 15- to 30-minute in-tervals during the first hour) should be performed to 
detect ischemic changes. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. Serial cardiac troponin I or T levels (when a con-
temporary assay is used) should be obtained at pre-
sentation and 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset (see 
Section 3.4, Class I, #3 recommendation if time of symptom onset is unclear) in all patients who pres-
ent with symptoms consistent with ACS to identify a 
rising and/or falling pattern of values.
21,64,67–71 (Level 
of Evidence: A)
4. Additional troponin levels should be obtained beyond 6 hours after symptom onset (see Section 3.4, Class I, #3 recommendation if time of symptom onset is un-clear) in patients with normal troponin levels on seri-
al examination when changes on ECG and/or clinical 
presentation confer an intermediate or high index of suspicion for ACS.
21,72–74 (Level of Evidence: A)
5. Risk scores should be used to assess prognosis in pa-
tients with NSTE-ACS.42–44,75–80 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class IIa
1. Risk-stratification models can be useful in manage-
ment.42–44,75–81 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. It is reasonable to obtain supplemental electrocardio-graphic leads V
7 to V9 in patients whose initial ECG 
is nondiagnostic and who are at intermediate/high 
risk of ACS.82–84 (Level of Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. Continuous monitoring with 12-lead ECG may be a 
reasonable alternative in patients whose initial ECG 
is nondiagnostic and who are at intermediate/high 
risk of ACS.85,86 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide or N-ter -
minal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide may be consid-ered to assess risk in patients with suspected ACS.

3.3.1. Rationale for Risk Stratification and Spectrum of 
Risk: High, Intermediate, and Low
Assessment of prognosis guides initial clinical evaluation and treatment and is useful for selecting the site of care (coronary care 
unit, monitored step-down unit, or outpatient monitored unit), 
antithrombotic therapies (eg, P2Y
12 inhibitors, platelet glycopro-
tein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitors [Sections 4.3.1.2 and 5.1.2.2]), and 
invasive management (Sections 4.4.2.1, 4.3.1, 4.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5). 
There is a strong relationship between indicators of ischemia 
due to CAD and prognosis ( Table 3 and Figure 2). Patients with 
a high likelihood of ischemia due to CAD are at greater risk of a 
major adverse cardiac event (MACE) than patients with a lower 
likelihood of ischemia due to CAD. Risk is highest at the time of presentation but remains elevated past the acute phase. By 6 months, NSTE-ACS mortality rates may equal or exceed those of STEMI.
58 By 12 months, rates of death, MI, and recurrent 
instability in contemporary registries are >10%. Early events are related to the ruptured coronary plaque and thrombosis, and later events are more closely associated with the pathophysiology of chronic atherosclerosis and LV systolic function.
92–98
3.3.2. Estimation of Level of RiskAt initial presentation, the clinical history, anginal symptoms and equivalents, physical examination, ECG, renal function, and cardiac troponin measurements can be integrated into an estimation of the risk of death and nonfatal cardiac ischemic events (Table 3 and Figure 2).
42,78
3.3.2.1. History: Angina Symptoms and Angina EquivalentsIn patients with or without known CAD, clinicians must deter -
mine whether the presentation is consistent with acute isch-emia, stable ischemic heart disease, or an alternative etiology. Factors in the initial clinical history related to the likelihood of acute ischemia include age, sex, symptoms, prior history of 
CAD, and the number of traditional risk factors.
99–105
The characteristics of angina include deep, poorly localized 
chest or arm pain that is reproducibly associated with exertion 
or emotional stress.106 Angina is relieved promptly (ie, in <5 
minutes) with rest and/or short-acting nitroglycerin. Patients with NSTE-ACS may have typical or atypical anginal symp-toms, but episodes are more severe and prolonged, may occur at rest, or may be precipitated by less exertion than the patient previously experienced. Some patients have no chest pain but 
present solely with dyspnea or with arm, shoulder, back, jaw, 
neck, epigastric, or ear discomfort.
107–109
Features not characteristic of myocardial ischemia include:
•	Pleuritic pain (sharp or knifelike pain provoked by res-
piration or cough);
•	Primary or sole location of discomfort in the middle or lower abdomen;
•	Pain localized by the tip of 1 finger, particularly at the 
LV apex or costochondral junction;
•	Pain reproduced with movement or palpation of the 
chest wall or arms;
•	Brief episodes of pain lasting a few seconds or less;
•	Pain that is of maximal intensity at onset; and
•	Pain that radiates into the lower extremities.
Evaluation should include the clinician’s impression of 
whether the pain represents a high, intermediate, or low likeli-
hood of acute ischemia.Although typical characteristics increase the probability of 
CAD, atypical features do not exclude ACS. In the Multicenter 
Chest Pain Study, acute ischemia was diagnosed in 22% of 
patients who presented to the ED with sharp or stabbing pain and 
in 13% of those with pleuritic pain.110 Seven percent of patients 
whose pain was reproduced with palpation had ACS. The ACI-
TIPI (Acute Cardiac Ischemia Time-Insensitive Predictive 
Instrument) project found that older age, male sex, chest or left 
arm pain, and chest pain or pressure were the most important 
findings, and each increased the likelihood of ACS.111,112
The relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin is not predic-
tive of ACS. One study reported that sublingual nitroglycerin 
relieved symptoms in 35% of patients with documented ACS 
compared with 41% of patients without ACS.113 The relief of 
chest pain by “gastrointestinal cocktails” (eg, mixtures of liq-uid antacids, and/or viscous lidocaine, and/or anticholinergic 
agents) does not predict the absence of ACS.
114
3.3.2.2. Demographics and History in Diagnosis and Risk 
Stratification
A prior history of MI is associated with a high risk of obstruc-
tive and multivessel CAD.115 Women with suspected ACS are 
less likely to have obstructive CAD than men. When obstructive 
CAD is present in women, it tends to be less severe than it is in 
men.116 It has been suggested that coronary microvascular dis-
ease and endothelial dysfunction play a role in the pathophysi-ology of NSTE-ACS in patients with nonobstructive CAD.
116 
Older adults have increased risks of underlying CAD,117,118 mul-
tivessel CAD, and a worse prognosis (Section 7.1).
A family history of premature CAD is associated with 
increased coronary artery calcium scores119 and increased risk 
of 30-day cardiac events in patients with ACS.120,121 Diabetes 
mellitus, extracardiac (carotid, aortic, or peripheral) arterial 
disease, and hypertension are major risk factors for poor out-
comes in patients with ACS (Section 6.2) with both STEMI122 
and NSTE-ACS.92
The current or prior use of aspirin at presentation is associated 
with increased cardiovascular risk,42 likely reflecting the greater 
probability that patients who have been prescribed aspirin have 
an increased cardiovascular risk profile and/or prior vascular Table 3.  TIMI Risk Score* for NSTE-ACS

disease. Smoking is associated with a lower risk of death in 
ACS,42,123,124 primarily because of the younger age of smokers 
with ACS and less severe CAD. Overweight and/or obesity at ACS presentation are associated with lower short-term risk of death. The “obesity paradox” may be a function of younger age at presentation, referral for angiography at an earlier stage of dis-ease, and more aggressive management of ACS.
123 These indi-
viduals, especially those with severe obesity (body mass index >35), have a higher long-term total mortality risk.
124–129
Cocaine use can cause ACS by inducing coronary vaso-
spasm, dissection, thrombosis, positive chronotropic and hypertensive actions, and direct myocardial toxicity (Section 7.10).
130 Methamphetamines are also associated with ACS.131 
Urine toxicology screening should be considered when sub-stance abuse is suspected as a cause of or contributor to ACS, especially in younger patients (<50 years of age).
132
3.3.2.3. Early Estimation of RiskThe TIMI risk score is composed of 7, 1-point risk indicators rated on presentation (Table 3).
42 The composite endpoints 
increase as the score increases. The TIMI risk score has been validated internally within the TIMI 11B trial and in 2 separate cohorts of patients from the ESSENCE (Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non–Q-Wave Coronary Event) trial.
133 The TIMI risk score calculator is available at 
www.timi.org. The TIMI risk index is useful in predicting 30-day and 1-year mortality in patients with NSTE-ACS.
134 
For patients with a TIMI risk score of 0 and normal high-sen-sitivity cardiac troponin 2 hours after presentation, accelerated diagnostic protocols have been developed that predict a very low rate of 30-day MACE (Section 3.4.3).
65
The GRACE risk model predicts in-hospital and post-
discharge mortality or MI.44,78,79,81 The GRACE tool was 
developed from 11 389 patients in GRACE and validated 
in subsequent GRACE and GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) IIb cohorts. The sum of scores is applied to a reference nomogram to determine all-cause mortality from hospital discharge to 6 months. The GRACE clinical applica-tion tool is a web-based downloadable application available at http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/ (Figure 2).
44,135
Among patients with a higher TIMI risk score (eg, ≥ 3), 
there is a greater benefit from therapies such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH),
133,136 platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors,137 
and an invasive strategy.138 Similarly, the GRACE risk model 
can identify patients who would benefit from an early invasive strategy.
139 Patients with elevated cardiac troponin benefit from 
more aggressive therapy, whereas those without elevated car -
diac troponins may not.140 This is especially true for women in 
whom some data suggest adverse effects from invasive thera-pies in the absence of an elevated cardiac troponin value.
141 
Although B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide are not useful for the diagnosis of ACS per se (but rather HF, which has many etiologies), they add prognostic value.
87–91
3.3.2.4. ElectrocardiogramThe 12-lead ECG is pivotal in the decision pathway for the eval-uation and management of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of ACS.
58,59,85 Transient ST changes (≥ 0.5 mm [0.05 
mV]) during symptoms at rest strongly suggest ischemia and underlying severe CAD. Patients without acute ischemic changes on ECG have a reduced risk of MI and a very low risk of in-hospital life-threatening complications, even in the presence of confounding electrocardiographic patterns such as LV hypertro-phy.
143–145 ST depression (especially horizontal or downsloping) 
is highly suggestive of NSTE-ACS.21,146,147 Marked symmetrical 
precordial T-wave inversion (≥ 2 mm [0.2 mV]) suggests acute 
ischemia, particularly due to a critical stenosis of the left anterior 
descending coronary artery148,149; it may also be seen with acute 
pulmonary embolism and right-sided ST-T changes.

tion of <0.5 mm [0.05 mV] or T-wave inversion of <2 mm

are less helpful, although by suggesting prior MI, they indi-
cate a high likelihood of significant CAD. Isolated Q waves 
in lead 3 are a normal finding. A completely normal ECG in a 
patient with chest pain does not exclude ACS, because 1% to 
6% of such patients will have a MI, and at least 4% will have 
UA.59–61 Fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated for patients 
with ACS without ST-elevation, except for those with electro-
cardiographic evidence of true posterior MI (ie, ST-elevation 
in posterior chest leads [V7 to V9]). This can be evaluated 
when acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is suspected but 
electrocardiographic changes are modest or not present82–84; 
a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for posterior wall motion abnormalities may also be helpful in this setting.
Alternative causes of ST-T changes include LV aneurysm, 
pericarditis, myocarditis, bundle-branch block, LV hypertro-
phy, hyperkalemia, Prinzmetal angina, early repolarization, 
apical LV ballooning syndrome (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, Section 7.13), and Wolff-Parkinson-White conduction. Central 
nervous system events and therapy with tricyclic antidepres-sants or phenothiazines can cause deep T-wave inversion.
3.3.2.5. Physical Examination
The physical examination is helpful in assessing the hemodynamic impact of an ischemic event. Patients with suspected ACS should 
have vital signs measured (BP in both arms if dissection is sus-
pected) and should undergo a thorough cardiovascular examination. 
Patients with evidence of LV dysfunction on examination (eg, rales, 
S
3 gallop) or acute mitral regurgitation have a higher likelihood of 
severe underlying CAD and are at high risk of a poor outcome. 
In the SHOCK (Should we Emergently Revascularize Occluded 
Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) study, NSTEMI accounted for 
approximately 20% of cardiogenic shock complicating MI.150 Other 
trials have reported lower percentages.92,151 The physical examina-
tion may also help identify comorbid conditions (eg, occult GI bleeding) that could impact therapeutic risk and decision making.

3.4. Cardiac Biomarkers and the Universal 
Definition of MI: Recommendations
See Table 5 for a summary of recommendations from this sec-
tion and Online Data Supplement 3 for additional information 
on cardiac injury markers and the universal definition of AMI.
3.4.1. Biomarkers: Diagnosis
Class I
1. Cardiac-specific troponin (troponin I or T when a 
contemporary assay is used) levels should be mea-
sured at presentation and 3 to 6 hours after symp-
tom onset in all patients who present with symptoms consistent with ACS to identify a rising and/or falling pattern.
21,64,67–71,152–156 (Level of Evidence: A)
2. Additional troponin levels should be obtained beyond 
6 hours after symptom onset in patients with normal 
troponins on serial examination when electrocardio-
graphic changes and/or clinical presentation con-
fer an intermediate or high index of suspicion for ACS.
21,72–74,157 (Level of Evidence: A)3. If the time of symptom onset is ambiguous, the time of 
presentation should be considered the time of onset for assessing troponin values.
67,68,72 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class III: No Benefit
1. With contemporary troponin assays, creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) and myoglobin are not 
useful for diagnosis of ACS.
158–164 (Level of  Evidence: A)
3.4.2. Biomarkers: Prognosis
Class I
1. The presence and magnitude of troponin elevations 
are useful for short- and long-term prognosis.71,73,165,166 
(Level of Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. It may be reasonable to remeasure troponin once on day 3 or day 4 in patients with MI as an index of infarct size and dynamics of necrosis.
164,165 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
2. Use of selected newer biomarkers, especially B-type 
natriuretic peptide, may be reasonable to provide 
additional prognostic information.87,88,167–171 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
Cardiac troponins are the mainstay for diagnosis of ACS and for 
risk stratification in patients with ACS. The primary diagnostic 
biomarkers of myocardial necrosis are cardiac troponin I and 
cardiac troponin T. Features that favor troponins for detection of ACS include high concentrations of troponins in the myo-cardium; virtual absence of troponins in nonmyocardial tissue; 
high-release ratio into the systemic circulation (amount found 
in blood relative to amount depleted from myocardium); rapid release into the blood in proportion to the extent of myocardial 
injury; and the ability to quantify values with reproducible, 
inexpensive, rapid, and easily applied assays. The 2012 Third Universal Definition of MI provides criteria that classify 5 clini-
cal presentations of MI on the basis of pathological, clinical, 
and prognostic factors.
21 In the appropriate clinical context, MI 
is indicated by a rising and/or falling pattern of troponin with ≥1 value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference level 
and evidence for serial increases or decreases in the levels of troponins.
67,68,156 The potential consequences of emerging high-
sensitivity troponin assays include increases in the diagnosis of NSTEMI
152,172,173 influenced by the definition of an abnormal tro-
ponin.67,153,174,175 The recommendations in this section are formu-
lated from studies predicated on both the new European Society of Cardiology/ACC/AHA/World Health Organization criteria
21 
and previous criteria/ redefinitions of MI based on earlier-gener -
ation troponin assays (Appendix 4, Table A).
3.4.3. Cardiac Troponins
See Online Data Supplement 4 for additional information on 
cardiac troponins.
Of the 3 troponin subunits, 2 subunits (troponin I and troponin T) 
are derived from genes specifically expressed in the myocardium. Cardiac troponin measurements provide highly sensitive results 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on November 12, 2025

e358  Circulation  December 23/30, 2014
specific for detecting cardiomyocyte necrosis.34,173 Highly sensitive 
assays can identify cardiac troponin not only in the blood of patients 
with acute cardiac injury, but also in the blood of most healthy peo-ple.
64,68,70,166,176,177 As assay sensitivity increases, a greater proportion 
of patients will have detectable long-term elevations in troponin, 
thus requiring consideration of serial changes for the diagnosis of 
MI. Clinicians should be aware of the sensitivity of the tests used for troponin evaluation in their hospitals and cutpoint concentrations for clinical decisions. Markedly elevated values are usually related to MI, myocarditis, rare analytical factors, or chronic elevations in 
patients with renal failure and in some patients with HF.
CPGs endorse the 99th percentile of the upper reference 
level as the appropriate cutpoint for considering myocardial 
necrosis.
21,22 For the diagnosis of acute myocardial necrosis, 
it is important to determine not only the peak troponin value, but also serial changes:
1. A troponin value above the 99th percentile of the upper 
reference level is required. Additionally, evidence for a serial increase or decrease ≥20% is required if the initial value is elevated.
21,178
2. For any troponin values below or close to the 99th percentile, evidence for acute myocardial necrosis is indicated by a change of ≥3 standard deviations of the variation around the initial value as determined by the individual laboratory.
21,179
3. Clinical laboratory reports should indicate whether sig-nificant changes in cardiac troponin values for the par -
ticular assay have occurred.
Absolute changes in nanograms per liter of high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin T levels appear to have a significantly higher 
diagnostic accuracy for AMI than relative changes and may distinguish AMI from other causes of high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T elevations.
71 This has also been suggested for some 
contemporary assays.71 Troponins are elevated in MI as early as 
2 to 4 hours after symptom onset,64,70 and many medical centers 
obtain troponins at 3 hours. Depending on the assay, values may 
not become abnormal for up to 12 hours. In the vast majority of patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS, MI can be excluded 
or confirmed within 6 hours, because very few patients present immediately after symptom onset. In high-risk patients, mea-
surements after 6 hours may be required to identify ACS.
Solitary elevations of troponin cannot be assumed to be due 
to MI, because troponin elevations can be due to tachyarrhyth-mia, hypotension or hypertension, cardiac trauma, acute HF, myocarditis and pericarditis, acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, and severe noncardiac conditions such as sepsis, burns, 
respiratory failure, acute neurological diseases, and drug toxicity 
(including cancer chemotherapy). Chronic elevations can result from structural cardiac abnormalities such as LV hypertrophy or ventricular dilatation and are also common in patients with renal 
insufficiency.
34 Patients with end-stage renal disease and no clini-
cal evidence of ACS frequently have elevations of cardiac tropo-
nin.180–182 With conventional assays, this is more common with 
cardiac troponin T than with cardiac troponin I.180 In the diagnosis 
of NSTEMI, cardiac troponin values must manifest an acute pat-
tern consistent with the clinical events, including ischemic symp-
toms and electrocardiographic changes. Troponin elevations may persist for up to 14 days or occasionally longer. There is a paucity of guidelines for establishment of reinfarction during the acute 
infarct period on the basis of troponin measurements. References 
suggest that an increase of >20% of previous troponin levels or an absolute increase of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T values (eg, >7 ng/L over 2 hours) may indicate reinfarction.
183–185
During pregnancy, troponin values are within the normal 
range in the absence of cardiovascular morbidities. There is 
controversy as to whether troponin levels are elevated in pre-
eclampsia, eclampsia, or gestational hypertension.186–189 When 
present, cardiac troponin elevations reflect myocardial necrosis.
Point-of-care troponin values may provide initial diagnostic 
information, although their sensitivity is substantially below that of central laboratory methods.
154,155,190–192 In addition, the 
rigorous quantitative assay standardization needed for routine diagnosis favors central laboratory testing.
3.4.3.1. Prognosis
Troponin elevations convey prognostic assessment beyond that 
of clinical information, the initial ECG, and the predischarge stress test.
71 In addition, troponin elevations may provide infor -
mation to direct therapy. Patients with cardiac troponin elevations Table 5.  Summary of Recommendations for Cardiac Biomarkers and the Universal Definition of MI

are at high risk and benefit from intensive management and early 
revascularization.193–195 High risk is optimally defined by the 
changing pattern as described in Section 3.4.3. Cardiac troponin elevations correlate with estimation of infarct size and risk of 
death; persistent elevation 72 to 96 hours after symptom onset 
may afford relevant information in this regard.
164 Elevations of 
cardiac troponin can occur for multiple reasons other than MI. In these cases, there is often substantial risk of adverse outcomes, as troponin elevation indicates cardiomyocyte necrosis.
181
3.4.4. CK-MB and Myoglobin Compared With Troponin
Previously, CK-MB was used for early evidence of myocar -
dial injury. Because myoglobin is a relatively small molecule, it is rapidly released from infarcted myocardium. CK-MB is 
much less sensitive for detection of myocardial injury than tro-
ponin, and substantially more tissue injury is required for its 
detection. With the availability of cardiac troponin, CK-MB, 
myoglobin, and other diagnostic biomarkers are no longer 
necessary.
158,160–163,196–198 CK-MB may be used to estimate MI 
size. Detection of MI after percutaneous coronary interven-tion (PCI) remains an area of controversy. Because of the 
increased sensitivity of cardiac troponin, the prognostic value 
associated with varying degrees of elevation remains unclear.
See Online Data Supplements 5, 6, and 7 for additional 
information on cardiac injury markers.
3.5. Immediate Management
3.5.1. Discharge From the ED or Chest Pain Unit: 
Recommendations
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to observe patients with symptoms 
consistent with ACS without objective evidence of 
myocardial ischemia (nonischemic initial ECG and normal cardiac troponin) in a chest pain unit or te-
lemetry unit with serial ECGs and cardiac troponin at 
3- to 6-hour intervals.
196,197,199–201 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who 
have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to 
have a treadmill ECG200–202 (Level of Evidence: A), 
stress myocardial perfusion imaging,200 or stress 
echocardiography203,204 before discharge or within 72 
hours after discharge. (Level of Evidence: B)
3. In patients with possible ACS and a normal ECG, normal cardiac troponins, and no history of CAD, it is reasonable to initially perform (without serial ECGs 
and troponins) coronary CT angiography to assess 
coronary artery anatomy
205–207 (Level of  Evidence: A) 
or rest myocardial perfusion imaging with a techne-tium-99m radiopharmaceutical to exclude myocar -
dial ischemia.
208,209 (Level of Evidence: B)
4. It is reasonable to give low-risk patients who are 
referred for outpatient testing daily aspirin, short-
acting nitroglycerin, and other medication if ap-propriate (eg, beta blockers), with instructions 
about activity level and clinician follow-up. (Level of 
 Evidence: C)
The majority of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain 
do not have ACS (Figure 1), and most are at low risk for major morbidity and mortality.
35 Low-risk patients are usually identi-
fied by an absence of history of cardiovascular disease, normal 
or near-normal initial ECG, normal initial troponin, and clinical stability.
35,202 The utility of an accelerated diagnostic protocol 
for detecting patients with benign conditions versus those who 
require admission for serious disease has been established.35 At 
minimum, these protocols involve serial ECGs and troponin measurements, both of which can be performed in the ED, a 
separate chest pain unit, or a telemetry unit. A 30-day negative predictive value >99% for ACS has been reported for patients 
presenting to the ED with chest pain who undergo a 2-hour accel-
erated diagnostic protocol composed of a TIMI risk score of 0, normal ECG, and normal high-sensitivity troponin at 0 hours and 2 hours (assuming appropriate follow-up care).
65,210 Some pro-
tocols also call for a functional or anatomic test (eg, treadmill 
test, rest scintigraphy, coronary CT angiography, stress imaging). 
Coronary CT angiography is associated with rapid assessment, high negative predictive value, decreased length of stay, and 
reduced costs
205–207; however, in the latter studies, it increased the 
rate of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization with uncertain long-term benefits in low-risk patients without ECG or 
troponin alterations.
211 Accelerated diagnostic protocols are also 
potentially applicable in intermediate-risk patients, whose pre-
sentation includes a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes 
mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or advanced age.202
See Online Data Supplement 8 for additional information 
on discharge from the ED or chest pain unit.
4. Early Hospital Care
The standard of care for patients who present with NSTE-ACS, including those with recurrent symptoms, ischemic electrocardio-graphic changes, or positive cardiac troponins, is admission for 
inpatient management. The goals of treatment are the immediate 
relief of ischemia and the prevention of MI and death. Initially, stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS are admitted to an interme-
diate (or step-down) care unit. Patients undergo continuous elec-
trocardiographic rhythm monitoring and observation for recurrent ischemia. Bed or chair rest is recommended for patients admit-ted with NSTE-ACS. Patients with NSTE-ACS should be treated with antianginal (Section 4.1.2.5), antiplatelet, and anticoagulant 
therapy (Section 4.3). Patients are managed with either an early 
invasive strategy or an ischemia-guided strategy (Section 4.4).
Patients with continuing angina, hemodynamic instability, 
uncontrolled arrhythmias, or a large MI should be admitted to a coronary care unit. The nurse-to-patient ratio should be sufficient 
to provide 1) continuous electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring, 
2) frequent assessment of vital signs and mental status, and 3) abil-ity to perform rapid cardioversion and defibrillation. These patients 
are usually observed in the coronary care unit for at least 24 hours. 
Those without recurrent ischemia, significant arrhythmias, pul-monary edema, or hemodynamic instability can be considered for 
admission or transfer to an intermediate care or telemetry unit.
An assessment of LV function is recommended because 
depressed LV function will likely influence pharmacological 
therapies (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors for depressed left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]), may sug-gest the presence of more extensive CAD, and may influence the 
choice of revascularization (PCI versus coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery [CABG]). Because significant valvular disease may

also influence the type of revascularization, echocardiography 
rather than ventriculography is often preferred for assessment of 
LV function.
4.1. Standard Medical Therapies.
See Table 6 for a summary of recommendations from this 
section.
4.1.1. Oxygen: Recommendation
Class I
1. Supplemental oxygen should be administered to pa-
tients with NSTE-ACS with arterial oxygen satura-
tion less than 90%, respiratory distress, or other high-
risk features of hypoxemia. (Level of Evidence: C)
Patients with cyanosis, arterial oxygen saturation <90%, respira-
tory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia are treated with supplemental oxygen. The 2007 UA/NSTEMI CPG recom-
mended the routine administration of supplemental oxygen to all patients with NSTE-ACS during the first 6 hours after presenta-tion on the premise that it is safe and may alleviate hypoxemia.
212 
The benefit of routine supplemental oxygen administration in normoxic patients with NSTE-ACS has never been demonstrated. At the time of GWC deliberations, data emerged that routine use 
of supplemental oxygen in cardiac patients may have untoward 
effects, including increased coronary vascular resistance, reduced coronary blood flow, and increased risk of mortality.

which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin if not contraindicat-ed.
216–218 (Level of Evidence: C)

tent ischemia, HF, or hypertension.

Class III: Harm
1. Nitrates should not be administered to patients with 
NSTE-ACS who recently received a phosphodiester -
ase inhibitor, especially within 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or within 48 hours of tadalafil.
225–227 
(Level of Evidence: B)
Nitrates are endothelium-independent vasodilators with 
peripheral and coronary vascular effects. By dilating the capac-itance vessels, nitrates decrease cardiac preload and reduce ventricular wall tension. More modest effects on the arterial circulation result in afterload reduction and further decrease in MVO
2. This may be partially offset by reflex increases in heart 
rate and contractility, which counteract the reduction in MVO2 
unless a beta blocker is concurrently administered. Nitrates also dilate normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries and increase coronary collateral flow. Nitrates may also inhibit platelet aggregation.
228
RCTs have not shown a reduction in MACE with nitrates. 
The rationale for nitrate use in NSTE-ACS is extrapolated from pathophysiological principles and extensive (although uncontrolled) clinical observations, experimental studies, and clinical experience. The decision to administer nitrates should not preclude therapy with other proven mortality-reducing interventions such as beta blockers.
Intravenous nitroglycerin is beneficial in patients with HF, 
hypertension, or symptoms that are not relieved with sublin-gual nitroglycerin and administration of a beta blocker.
219,221–224 
Patients who require intravenous nitroglycerin for >24 hours may require periodic increases in the infusion rate and use of nontolerance-producing regimens (eg, intermittent dosing) to maintain efficacy. In current practice, most patients who require continued intravenous nitroglycerin for the relief of angina undergo prompt coronary angiography and revascular -
ization. Topical or oral nitrates are acceptable alternatives to intravenous nitroglycerin for patients who do not have refrac-tory or recurrent ischemia.
229,230 Side effects of nitrates include 
headache and hypotension. Nitrates should not be adminis-tered to patients with hypotension or to those who received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and are administered with caution to patients with right ventricular infarction.
231
See Online Data Supplement 9 for additional information 
on nitrates.
4.1.2.2. Analgesic Therapy: Recommendations
Class IIb
1. In the absence of contraindications, it may be reason-
able to administer morphine sulfate intravenously to patients with NSTE-ACS if there is continued ischemic chest pain despite treatment with maximally tolerated 
anti-ischemic medications.
232,233 (Level of Evidence: B)
Class III: Harm
1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ex-cept aspirin) should not be initiated and should be 
discontinued during hospitalization for NSTE-ACS because of the increased risk of MACE associated with their use.
234,235 (Level of Evidence: B)
The role of morphine sulfate was re-evaluated for this CPG 
revision, including studies that suggest the potential for 
adverse events with its use.232 Morphine sulfate has potent 
analgesic and anxiolytic effects, as well as hemodynamic 
actions, that are potentially beneficial in NSTE-ACS. It 
causes venodilation and produces modest reductions in heart 
rate (through increased vagal tone) and systolic BP. In patients 
with symptoms despite antianginal treatment, morphine  
(1 mg to 5 mg IV) may be administered during intravenous nitroglycerin therapy with BP monitoring. The morphine dose 
may be repeated every 5 to 30 minutes to relieve symptoms and maintain the patient’s comfort. Its use should not preclude 
the use of other anti-ischemic therapies with proven benefits 
in patients with NSTE-ACS. To our knowledge, no RCTs have 
assessed the use of morphine in patients with NSTE-ACS or 
defined its optimal administration schedule. Observational 
studies have demonstrated increased adverse events associ-
ated with the use of morphine sulfate in patients with ACS and 
acute decompensated HF.
232,233,236 Although these reports were 
observational, uncontrolled studies limited by selection bias, 
they raised important safety concerns.
Although constipation, nausea, and/or vomiting occur in 
>20% of patients, hypotension and respiratory depression are the most serious complications of excessive use of mor -
phine. Naloxone (0.4 mg to 2.0 mg IV) may be adminis-tered for morphine overdose with respiratory or circulatory 
depression.
Traditional NSAIDs and selective cyclooxygenase 
(COX)-2 inhibitors markedly block endothelial prostacyclin production, which leads to unopposed platelet aggregation by platelet-derived thromboxane A
2. Both types of NSAIDs 
prevent the beneficial actions of aspirin and interfere with the inhibition of COX-1, thromboxane A
2 production, and platelet 
aggregation. Because of their inhibitory activity on the ubiq-
uitous COXs, NSAIDs have an extensive adverse side effect profile, particularly renal and gastrointestinal. The increased 
cardiovascular hazards associated with NSAIDs have been 
observed in several studies of patients without ACS.
234,235,237,238 
The PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of 
Celecoxib Integrated Safety Versus Ibuprofen Or Naproxen) 
trial, in progress at the time of publication, is the first study of 
patients with high cardiovascular risk who are receiving long-
term treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor or traditional 
NSAIDs. PRECISION will examine the relative cardiovas-
cular safety profiles of celecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen in patients without ACS.

4.1.2.3. Beta-Adrenergic Blockers: Recommendations
Class I
1. Oral beta-blocker therapy should be initiated with-
in the first 24 hours in patients who do not have any of the following: 1) signs of HF, 2) evidence of 
low-output state, 3) increased risk for cardiogenic 
shock, or 4) other contraindications to beta block-ade (eg, PR interval >0.24 second, second- or third-
degree heart block without a cardiac pacemaker, 
active asthma, or reactive airway disease).
240–242 
(Level of Evidence: A)
2. In patients with concomitant NSTE-ACS, stabilized 
HF, and reduced systolic function, it is recommended 
to continue beta-blocker therapy with 1 of the 3 drugs 
proven to reduce mortality in patients with HF: sus-
tained-release metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, or bi-soprolol. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. Patients with documented contraindications to beta 
blockers in the first 24 hours of NSTE-ACS should be 
re-evaluated to determine their subsequent eligibility. 
(Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to continue beta-blocker therapy in patients with normal LV function with NSTE-
ACS.
241,243 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class III: Harm
1. Administration of intravenous beta blockers is poten-tially harmful in patients with NSTE-ACS who have 
risk factors for shock.
244 (Level of Evidence: B)
Beta blockers decrease heart rate, contractility, and BP, result-
ing in decreased MVO2. Beta blockers without increased 
sympathomimetic activity should be administered orally in the absence of contraindications. Although early administra-tion does not reduce short-term mortality,
241,244 beta blockers 
decrease myocardial ischemia, reinfarction, and the frequency of complex ventricular dysrhythmias,
240,245 and they increase 
long-term survival. Early beta blockade, particularly if given intravenously, can increase the likelihood of shock in patients with risk factors. Risk factors for shock include patients >70 
years of age, heart rate >110 beats per minute, systolic BP <120 mm Hg, and late presentation.
244 In patients with LV dys-
function (LVEF <0.40) with or without pulmonary congestion, beta blockers are strongly recommended before discharge. 
Beta blockers should be used prudently with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with HF. 
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocking agents should be cautiously added in patients with decompensated HF.
246 
Beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity should be used, especially beta-1 blockers such as sustained-
release metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, or carvedilol, a beta-1 and alpha-1 blocker. This is because of their mortality benefit 
in patients with HF and systolic dysfunction.
246,247 In patients 
with chronic obstructive lung disease or a history of asthma, beta blockers are not contraindicated in the absence of active bronchospasm. Beta-1 selective beta blockers are preferred and 
should be initiated at a low dosage.
See Online Data Supplement 11 for additional information 
on beta blockers, including risk factors for shock.
4.1.2.4. Calcium Channel Blockers: Recommendations
Class I
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS, continuing or frequent-
ly recurring ischemia, and a contraindication to beta blockers, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) (eg, verapamil or diltiazem) should be given as initial therapy in the absence of clinically 
significant LV dysfunction, increased risk for cardio-
genic shock, PR interval greater than 0.24 second, or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block with-out a cardiac pacemaker.
248–250 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Oral nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists are recommended in patients with NSTE-ACS who have recurrent ischemia in the absence of contra-indications, after appropriate use of beta blockers and nitrates. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. CCBs† are recommended for ischemic symptoms when beta blockers are not successful, are contrain-dicated, or cause unacceptable side effects. (Level of Evidence: C)
4. Long-acting CCBs and nitrates are recommended in patients with coronary artery spasm. (Level of Evi-
dence: C)
Class III: Harm
1. Immediate-release nifedipine should not be adminis-
tered to patients with NSTE-ACS in the absence of beta-blocker therapy.
251,252 (Level of Evidence: B)
CCBs include dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridines. The 
dihydropyridines (nifedipine and amlodipine) produce the most marked peripheral vasodilation and have little direct effect on 
contractility, atrioventricular conduction, and heart rate. The 
nondihydropyridines (diltiazem and verapamil) have significant negative inotropic actions and negative chronotropic and drom-otropic effects. All CCBs cause similar coronary vasodilation 
and are preferred in vasospastic angina.
253 They also alleviate 
ischemia due to obstructive CAD by decreasing heart rate and 
BP. Verapamil and diltiazem decreased reinfarction in patients 
without LV dysfunction in some248,249,254 but not all studies.255,256 
Verapamil may be beneficial in reducing long-term events 
after AMI in hypertensive patients without LV dysfunction250 
and in patients with MI and HF receiving an ACE inhibitor.257 
Immediate-release nifedipine causes a dose-related increase in mortality in patients with CAD and harm in ACS and is not recommended for routine use in patients with ACS.
251,258 Long-
acting preparations may be useful in older patients with systolic 
hypertension.259 There are no significant trial data on efficacy of 
amlodipine or felodipine in patients with NSTE-ACS.
See Online Data Supplement 12 for additional information 
on CCBs.

avoided.

4.1.2.5. Other Anti-Ischemic Interventions
Ranolazine
Ranolazine is an antianginal medication with minimal effects 
on heart rate and BP.260,261 It inhibits the late inward sodium cur -
rent and reduces the deleterious effects of intracellular sodium 
and calcium overload that accompany myocardial ischemia.262 
Ranolazine is currently indicated for treatment of chronic angina. The MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With 
Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non–ST-Elevation Acute 
Coronary Syndromes-Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction) 
36 trial examined the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in 6560 
patients with NSTE-ACS who presented within 48 hours of 
ischemic symptoms.
263 In a post hoc analysis in women, rano-
lazine was associated with a reduced incidence of the primary 
endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, or recurrent ischemia), 
principally owing to a 29% reduction in recurrent ischemia.116 
In the subgroup with prior chronic angina (n=3565), ranola-zine was associated with a lower primary composite endpoint, a significant reduction of worsening angina, and increased 
exercise duration.
264 Because the primary endpoint of the 
original MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial was not met, all additional 
analyses should be interpreted with caution. The recom-mended initial dose is 500 mg orally twice daily, which can 
be uptitrated to a maximum of 1000 mg orally twice daily. 
Ranolazine is usually well tolerated; its major adverse effects are constipation, nausea, dizziness, and headache. Ranolazine 
prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner, but QTc 
prolongation requiring dose reduction was comparable with ranolazine and placebo in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial.
263
See Online Data Supplement 13 for additional information 
on ranolazine.
Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) Counterpulsation
IABP counterpulsation may be used in patients with NSTE-
ACS to treat severe persistent or recurrent ischemia, especially in patients awaiting invasive angiography and revascular -
ization, despite intensive medical therapy. In experimental studies, IABP counterpulsation increases diastolic BP and 
coronary blood flow and potentially augments cardiac output 
while diminishing LV end-diastolic pressure. The use of IABP for refractory ischemia dates back several decades, and its current application is predominantly driven by clinical experi-
ence and nonrandomized observational studies.
265 When stud-
ied in rigorous RCTs, IABP counterpulsation failed to reduce 
MACE in high-risk elective PCI,266 decrease infarct size after 
primary PCI for acute STEMI,267 or diminish early mortality 
in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI.268
4.1.2.6. Cholesterol Management
Class I
1. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or 
continued in all patients with NSTE-ACS and no con-traindications to its use.
269–273 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to obtain a fasting lipid profile in pa-tients with NSTE-ACS, preferably within 24 hours of presentation. (Level of Evidence: C)Therapy with statins in patients with NSTE-ACS reduces 
the rate of recurrent MI, coronary heart disease mortality, 
need for myocardial revascularization, and stroke. High-risk 
patients, such as those with NSTE-ACS, derive more benefit in reducing these events from high-intensity statins, such as 
atorvastatin which lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels by ≥50% as in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or 
Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) and MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction With Acute Cholesterol Lowering) trials,
273,274 than 
from moderate- or low-intensity statins.18,272 These findings 
provide the basis for high-intensity statin therapy after stabi-lization of patients with NSTE-ACS. In addition, early intro-
duction of this approach can promote improved compliance 
with this regimen.
4.2. Inhibitors of the Renin-Angiotensin-
Aldosterone System: Recommendations
Class I
1. ACE inhibitors should be started and continued in-
definitely in all patients with LVEF less than 0.40 and in those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or sta-ble CKD (Section 7.6), unless contraindicated.
275,276 
(Level of Evidence: A)
2. ARBs are recommended in patients with HF or MI with LVEF less than 0.40 who are ACE inhibitor in-tolerant.
277,278 (Level of Evidence: A)
3. Aldosterone blockade is recommended in patients post–MI without significant renal dysfunction (cre-atinine >2.5 mg/dL in men or >2.0 mg/dL in women) 
or hyperkalemia (K+ >5.0 mEq/L) who are receiving 
therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and have a LVEF 0.40 or less, diabetes mellitus, or HF.
279 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class IIa
1. ARBs are reasonable in other patients with cardiac or other vascular disease who are ACE inhibitor in-tolerant.
280 (Level of Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. ACE inhibitors may be reasonable in all other pa-tients with cardiac or other vascular disease.
281,282 
(Level of Evidence: B)
ACE inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with recent MI, 
primarily those with LV dysfunction (LVEF <0.40) with or without pulmonary congestion.
283–285 In patients with normal 
LV function (including patients with diabetes mellitus), total 
mortality and MACE (including HF) are reduced. It has been 
found that approximately 15% of patients with NSTEMI 
develop HF during hospitalization, with the rate increas-ing to 24% of patients 1 year later.
286 A metaanalysis dem-
onstrated a small but significant (0.48%) absolute benefit of early initiation of an ACE inhibitor on survival at 30 days, with benefit seen as early as 24 hours after admission for 
AMI.
283 An ACE inhibitor should be used cautiously in the

first 24 hours of AMI, because it may result in hypotension 
or renal dysfunction.283 It may be prudent to initially use a 
short-acting ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalapril, in 
patients at increased risk of these adverse events. In patients 
with significant renal dysfunction, it is sensible to stabilize renal function before initiating an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, 
with re-evaluation of creatinine levels after drug initiation. An 
ARB may be substituted for an ACE inhibitor with similar 
benefits on survival.
277,278 Combining an ACE inhibitor and an 
ARB may result in an increase in adverse events.277,278 In a 
study in which patients with AMI with LV dysfunction (LVEF <0.40) with or without HF were randomized 3 to 14 days after 
AMI to receive eplerenone (a selective aldosterone blocker), eplerenone was efficacious as an adjunct to ACE inhibitors 
and beta blockers in decreasing long-term mortality.
279,287 In 
a study of patients with HF, >50% of whom had an ischemic etiology, spironolactone (a nonselective aldosterone inhibitor) 
was beneficial
279; however, RCT data on MI are not available.
See Online Data Supplement 14 for additional information 
on inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
4.3. Initial Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Therapy  
in Patients With Definite or Likely NSTE-ACS
4.3.1. Initial Oral and Intravenous Antiplatelet Therapy 
in Patients With Definite or Likely NSTE-ACS Treated 
With an Initial Invasive or Ischemia-Guided Strategy: 
Recommendations
See Table 7 for a summary of recommendations from this 
section and Online Data Supplement 15 for additional infor -
mation on initial oral and intravenous antiplatelet therapy in 
patients with definite or likely NSTE-ACS treated with an 
early invasive or an ischemia-guided strategy.
Class I‡
1. Non–enteric-coated, chewable aspirin (162 mg to 
325 mg) I should be given to all patients with NSTE-
ACS without contraindications as soon as possible 
after presentation, and a maintenance dose of aspirin 
(81 mg/d to 325 mg/d) should be continued indefinite-
ly.288–290,293,391 (Level of Evidence: A)
2. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are unable to take 
aspirin because of hypersensitivity or major gastro-
intestinal intolerance, a loading dose of clopidogrel 
followed by a daily maintenance dose should be ad-
ministered.291 (Level of Evidence: B)
3. A P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in 
addition to aspirin should be administered for up to 
12 months to all patients with NSTE-ACS without con-
traindications who are treated with either an early in-
vasive§ or ischemia-guided strategy. Options include:
•	Clopidogrel: 300-mg or 600-mg loading dose, then 
75 mg daily289,292 (Level of Evidence: B)
•	Ticagrelor║: 180-mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily
293,294 (Level of Evidence: B)Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clop-
idogrel for P2Y12 treatment in patients with NSTE-
ACS who undergo an early invasive or ischemia-guided strategy.
293,294 (Level of Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with an early inva-sive strategy and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with intermediate/high-risk features (eg, positive troponin), 
a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor may be considered as part of ini-
tial antiplatelet therapy. Preferred options are eptifiba-tide or tirofiban.
43,94,295 (Level of Evidence: B)
Despite the large number of new antiplatelet and antithrombotic 
agents, aspirin, which targets COX and subsequent throm-
boxane A2 inhibition, is the mainstay of antiplatelet therapy. 
Multiple other pathways of platelet activation can be targeted by agents that inhibit the platelet P2Y
12 receptor, including thi-
enopyridine prodrug agents, such as clopidogrel and prasugrel, which require conversion into molecules that bind irreversibly 
to the P2Y
12 receptor. Additional pyrimidine derivatives, includ-
ing ticagrelor, do not require biotransformation and bind revers-
ibly to the P2Y12 receptor, antagonizing adenosine diphosphate 
platelet activation. In addition to these oral agents, intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, including abciximab, eptifiba-
tide, and tirofiban, target the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. In the EARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa 
Inhibition in Patients With Non–ST-Segment Elevation Acute 
Coronary Syndrome) trial, patients were randomly assigned 
to either early, pre–PCI double-bolus eptifibatide or delayed, 
provisional eptifibatide. Seventy-five percent of the patients received upstream, preprocedure clopidogrel. The risk of TIMI 
major bleeding in the early eptifibatide group was 2.6% com-
pared with 1.8% (P =0.02) in the delayed provisional group.
295 
In the GUSTO IV-ACS (Global Use of Strategies To Open 
Occluded Coronary Arteries IV-Acute Coronary Syndromes) 
trial, there was no clinical benefit of abciximab in this popu-lation; in troponin-negative patients, mortality was 8.5% com-
pared with 5.8% in controls (P =0.002).
288,289,296,297
4.3.1.1. Aspirin
Aspirin is the established first-line therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS and reduces the incidence of recurrent MI and 
death.
288,289 A loading dose of non–enteric-coated aspirin 162 
mg to 325 mg is the initial antiplatelet therapy. The subse-quent maintenance dose is 81 mg per day to 162 mg per day; in special circumstances, a higher maintenance dose up to  
325 mg daily has been used.
391 The lower dose is favored and 
all patients treated with ticagrelor should receive only 81 mg per day.
290 In other countries, available low-dose aspirin for -
mations may include 75 mg and 100 mg. High-dose (≥160 mg) versus low-dose (<l60 mg) aspirin is associated with increased 
bleeding risk in the absence of improved outcomes.
298 Most 
NSAIDs reversibly bind to COX-1, preventing inhibition by 
aspirin and by COX-2 and may cause prothrombotic effects. 
Enteric-coated aspirin should be avoided initially because of its delayed and reduced absorption.
299‡See Section 5.1.2.1 for recommendations at the time of PCI.
§See Section 4.3.1.2 for prasugrel indications in either an early invasive 
or ischemia-guided strategy.

4.3.1.2. P2Y12 Receptor Inhibitors
Three P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are approved in the United 
States for treatment of ischemic myocardial disorders, including 
NSTE-ACS. For discontinuation before surgery, see Section 5.
Clopidogrel
Administration of clopidogrel with aspirin was superior to 
administration of aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death and nonfatal MI or stroke both acutely and over the following 11 months.
289,296 There was a slight 
increase in major bleeding events with clopidogrel, including 
a nonsignificant increase in life-threatening bleeding and fatal bleeding.
289 An initial loading dose of 300 mg to 600 mg is rec-
ommended.289,296,300 A 600-mg loading dose results in a greater, 
more rapid, and more reliable platelet inhibition compared with a 300-mg loading dose.
301 Use of clopidogrel for patients 
with NSTE-ACS who are aspirin intolerant is based on a study Table 7.  Summary of Recommendations for Initial Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Definite or Likely NSTE-ACS

in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.291 When pos-
sible, discontinue clopidogrel at least 5 days before surgery.301
Prasugrel
The metabolic conversion pathways of prasugrel produce 
more rapid and consistent platelet inhibition than clopido-
grel.300 In patients with NSTE-ACS and defined coronary 
anatomy undergoing planned PCI, a 60-mg loading dose 
of prasugrel followed by 10 mg daily was compared with a 
300-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily of clopidogrel. The composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke) was reduced in patients treated with prasu-
grel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81; P=0.001). This was driven by 
a risk reduction for MI and stent thrombosis with no differ -
ence in mortality.
302 Counterbalancing the salutary effects of 
prasugrel was a significant increase in spontaneous bleeding, 
life-threatening bleeding, and fatal bleeding in the patients 
treated with prasugrel compared with patients treated with clopidogrel. There was net harm in patients with a history of cerebrovascular events and no clinical benefit in patients 
>75 years of age or those with low body weight (<60 kg).
302 
In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with an ischemia-guided 
strategy, 1 RCT comparing aspirin and either clopidogrel or 
prasugrel evaluated the primary endpoint of death from car -
diovascular causes, MI, or stroke for up to 30 months; there 
were similar bleeding rates and no benefit of treatment with prasugrel when compared with treatment with clopidogrel.
303 
The ACCOAST (A Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at 
the Time of Diagnosis in Patients With Non–ST-Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction) RCT of high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS scheduled to undergo early coronary angiography found that a strategy of administration of prasugrel at the time of 
randomization before angiography did not lead to a reduc-
tion in the composite primary endpoint when compared with a strategy of administration of prasugrel only at the time of PCI; however, it did lead to an increase in bleeding complica-
tions.
304 On the basis of TRITON (Trial to Assess Improvement 
in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition 
with Prasugrel) study design and the results of TRILOGY 
ACS (Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal 
Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) and ACCOAST, prasugrel is not recommended for “upfront” therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS. The use of prasugrel in 
patients undergoing PCI is addressed in Section 5.
Ticagrelor
Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding P2Y
12 inhibitor with 
a relatively short plasma half-life (12 hours). Compared with 
clopidogrel, ticagrelor has a more rapid and consistent onset 
of action and, because it is reversible, it has a faster recovery of platelet function. The loading dose of ticagrelor for patients treated either invasively or with an ischemia-guided strategy 
is 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice 
daily.
293,294 In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with ticagrelor 
compared with clopidogrel, there was a reduction in the com-
posite outcome of death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke 
(reduction: 11.7% to 9.8%; HR: 0.84; P<0.001).293 The mor -
tality rate was also lower in those patients treated with ticagre-lor. Although overall major bleeding was not increased with ticagrelor, a modest increase in major bleeding and non–pro-
cedure-related bleeding occurred in the subgroup of patients 
who did not undergo CABG (major bleeding: 4.5% versus 
3.8%; P=0.02; non-procedure major bleeding: 3.1% versus 
2.3%; P=0.05); however, there was no difference in blood 
transfusion or fatal bleeding.
305 Side effects unique to ticagre-
lor include dyspnea (which occurs in up to 15% of patients 
within the first week of treatment but is rarely severe enough 
to cause discontinuation of treatment)293 and bradycardia. The 
benefit of ticagrelor over clopidogrel was limited to patients taking 75 mg to 100 mg of aspirin.
290 The short half-life 
requires twice-daily administration, which could potentially result in adverse events in non-compliant patients, particularly 
after stent implantation. When possible, ticagrelor should 
be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery.
306 Although 
ticagrelor has not been studied in the absence of aspirin, its 
use in aspirin-intolerant patients is a reasonable alternative.
Intravenous GP IIb/IIIa Receptor Inhibitors
The small molecule GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, tirofiban 
and eptifibatide, bind reversibly to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor. 
Because the drug-to-receptor ratio is high, platelet infusion is not effective in cases of severe bleeding after use of eptifiba-tide or tirofiban, and they must be cleared from the circulation to reduce bleeding. In contrast, with abciximab, the drug-to-
receptor ratio is low, and platelet infusion may be effective.
Several large RCTs evaluated the impact of GP IIb/IIIa 
receptor inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS who were 
committed to an invasive strategy.
295,296,306 The ACUITY (Acute 
Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial evaluated unfractionated heparin (UFH) versus bivalirudin with 
or without GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
295,307 The rates of composite 
ischemia (death, MI, unplanned revascularization) in patients 
who received bivalirudin alone compared with those who 
received UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were similar (9% ver -
sus 8%; P =0.45).307 Fewer patients experienced major bleeding 
with bivalirudin alone than did with heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors (4% versus 7%; relative risk [RR]: 0.52; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.66; P<0.0001).307 The ACUITY 
Timing trial evaluated the benefit of upstream GP IIb/IIIa 
receptor antagonist compared with its deferred use, testing the 
hypothesis that earlier administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
in patients destined for PCI would be superior.308 Composite 
ischemia at 30 days occurred in 7.9% of patients assigned to 
deferred use compared with 7.1% assigned to upstream admin-
istration (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.29; P=0.044 for noninfe-
riority; P=0.13 for superiority). Deferred GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
reduced the 30-day rates of major bleeding compared with 
upstream use (4.9% versus 6.1%; P <0.001).308 Similar results 
were reported by the EARLY ACS investigators, who evaluated 
eptifibatide given upstream versus delayed, provisional admin-
istration in >9000 patients with NSTE-ACS.295 The compos-
ite endpoint of death, MI, recurrent ischemia requiring urgent 
revascularization, or thrombotic complications occurred in 
9.3% of patients in the early-eptifibatide group compared with 
10% in the delayed-eptifibatide group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.06; P =0.23).
308 As in the ACUITY Timing 
trial, the early-eptifibatide group had significantly higher rates of bleeding and red cell transfusions.

4.3.2. Initial Parenteral Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients 
With Definite NSTE-ACS: Recommendations
See Table 7 for a summary of recommendations regarding antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in patients with definite or likely NSTE-ACS and Online Data Supplement 16 for addi-tional information on combined oral anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet therapy in patients with definite NSTE-ACS.
Class I‡
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS, anticoagulation, in ad-
dition to antiplatelet therapy, is recommended for all patients irrespective of initial treatment strategy. 
Treatment options include:
•	Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) every 
12 hours (reduce dose to 1 mg/kg SC once daily 
in patients with creatinine clearance [CrCl]  
<30 mL/min), continued for the duration of hos-
pitalization or until PCI is performed. An initial 
intravenous loading dose of 30 mg has been used 
in selected patients.133,136,309 (Level of Evidence: A)
•	Bivalirudin: 0.10 mg/kg loading dose followed by 
0.25 mg/kg per hour (only in patients managed with an early invasive strategy), continued until 
diagnostic angiography or PCI, with only provi-
sional use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, provided the 
patient is also treated with DAPT.
292,293,310,311 (Level 
of Evidence: B)
•	Fondaparinux: 2.5 mg SC daily, continued for the 
duration of hospitalization or until PCI is per -
formed.312–314 (Level of Evidence: B)
•	If PCI is performed while the patient is on fondaparinux, an additional anticoagulant with 
anti-IIa activity (either UFH or bivalirudin) should 
be administered because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.
313–315 (Level of Evidence: B)
•	UFH IV: initial loading dose of 60 IU/kg (maxi-mum 4000 IU) with initial infusion of 12 IU/kg per hour (maximum 1000 IU/h) adjusted per activated 
partial thromboplastin time to maintain therapeu-
tic anticoagulation according to the specific hospi-
tal protocol, continued for 48 hours or until PCI is 
performed.
316–322 (Level of Evidence: B)
4.3.2.1. Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin
LMWHs have a molecular weight approximately one third that of UFH and have balanced anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity. LMWHs are readily absorbed after subcutaneous administration and have 
less platelet activation.
323 The anticoagulant activity of LMWH 
does not require routine monitoring. The dose of enoxaparin is 1 
mg/kg SC every 12 hours for NSTE-ACS; an initial intravenous loading dose of 30 mg has been used in selected patients. In the presence of impaired renal function (CrCl <30 mL per minute), which is a common finding in older patients, the dose should be reduced to 1 mg/kg SC once daily, and strong consideration should be given to UFH as an alternative. Calculation of CrCl is prudent in patients considered for enoxaparin therapy.
In the ESSENCE trial, in patients with UA or non–Q-wave MI, 
the rates of recurrent ischemic events and invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were significantly reduced by enoxaparin 
therapy in the short term, and benefit was sustained at 1 year.
324
In the SYNERGY (Superior Yield of the New Strategy 
of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors) trial of high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS treated 
with an early invasive strategy, there was no significant difference in death or MI at 30 days between those randomized to enoxapa-
rin versus UFH. There was more TIMI major bleeding in those 
treated with enoxaparin without statistically significant increase in GUSTO severe bleeding or transfusion. Some of the increased bleeding may have been related to patients randomized to enoxa-
parin who received additional UFH at the time of PCI.
325,326
4.3.2.2. Bivalirudin
The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin is administered intra-
venously. Bivalirudin was evaluated in the ACUITY trial, a 
randomized open-label trial, in 13 819 moderate- to high-risk 
patients with NSTE-ACS with a planned invasive strategy. 
Three treatment arms were tested, including UFH or LMWH 
with a GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, bivalirudin with a GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, or bivalirudin alone. The majority of patients received clopidogrel (300 mg) before interven-tion, in addition to aspirin, anticoagulants, and GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors. Bivalirudin alone was noninferior to the standard 
UFH/LMWH combined with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (composite ischemia endpoint 7.8% versus 7.3%; HR: 1.08; P=0.32), but 
there was a significantly lower rate of major bleeding with 
bivalirudin (3.0% versus 5.7%; HR: 0.53; P<0.001).
310 The 
anticoagulant effect of bivalirudin can be monitored in the catheterization laboratory by the activated clotting time.
4.3.2.3. Fondaparinux
Fondaparinux is a synthetic polysaccharide molecule and the only selective inhibitor of activated factor X available for clinical use. Fondaparinux is well absorbed when given sub-cutaneously and has a half-life of 17 hours, enabling once-
daily administration. Because it is excreted by the kidneys, it 
is contraindicated if CrCl is <30 mL per minute. Monitoring of anti-Xa activity is not required, and fondaparinux does not affect usual anticoagulant parameters such as activated partial 
thromboplastin time or activated clotting time. In NSTE-ACS, 
the dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg SC administered daily and continued for the duration of hospitalization or until PCI is per -
formed.
312–314 In the OASIS (Organization to Assess Strategies 
in Ischemic Syndromes)-5 study, patients with NSTE-ACS 
were randomized to receive 2.5 mg SC fondaparinux daily 
or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily for 8 days. The inci-dence of the primary composite ischemic endpoint at 9 days was similar between fondaparinux and enoxaparin, but major 
bleeding was significantly less frequent with fondaparinux. To 
avert catheter thrombosis when fondaparinux is used alone in patients undergoing PCI, an anticoagulant with anti-IIa activ-ity is also administered.
313–315 One regimen is 85 IU/kg of UFH 
loading dose at the time of PCI (reduced to 60 IU/kg if a GP 
IIb/IIIa inhibitor is used concomitantly).314
4.3.2.4. Unfractionated Heparin
Studies supporting the addition of a parenteral anticoagulant 
to aspirin in patients with NSTE-ACS were performed primar -
ily on patients with a diagnosis of “unstable angina” in the era 
before DAPT and early catheterization and revascularization. ‡See Section 5.1.2.1 for recommendations at the time of PCI.
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on November 12, 2025

e368  Circulation  December 23/30, 2014
In general, those studies found a strong trend for reduction in 
composite adverse events with the addition of parenteral UFH 
to aspirin therapy.316–322
Clinical trials indicate that a weight-adjusted dosing regi-
men of UFH can provide more predictable anticoagulation327 
than a fixed initial dose (eg, 5000 IU loading dose, 1000 IU/h 
initial infusion). The recommended weight-adjusted regimen is an initial loading dose of 60 IU/kg (maximum 4000 IU) and an initial infusion of 12 IU/kg/h (maximum 1000 IU/h), adjusted using a standardized nomogram.
4.3.2.5. Argatroban
Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is indicated for pro-phylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, including those undergoing PCI.
328 
Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 3 hours after intravenous administration. Because of its hepatic metab-olism, argatroban can be used in patients with renal insuffi-ciency. The usual dose is 2 mcg/kg per minute by continuous intravenous infusion, adjusted to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time at 1.5 to 3 times baseline (but not >100 s).
4.3.3. Fibrinolytic Therapy in Patients With Definite  
NSTE-ACS: Recommendation
Class III: Harm
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS (ie, without ST-elevation, 
true posterior MI, or left bundle-branch block not known to be old), intravenous fibrinolytic therapy should not be used.
93,329 (Level of Evidence: A)
There is no role for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with NSTE-
ACS. Fibrinolysis with or without subsequent PCI in patients 
with NSTE-ACS was evaluated by the Fibrinolytic Trialists and TIMI investigators.
93,329 There was no benefit for mortality or 
MI. Intracranial hemorrhage and fatal and nonfatal MI occurred more frequently in patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy.
See Online Data Supplement 17 for additional informa-
tion on parenteral anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy in patients with definite NSTE-ACS.
4.4. Ischemia-Guided Strategy Versus Early 
Invasive Strategies
See Figure 3 for the management algorithm for ischemia-
guided versus early invasive strategy.
4.4.1. General Principles
Two treatment pathways have emerged for all patients with NSTE-ACS. The invasive strategy triages patients to an inva-
sive diagnostic evaluation (ie, coronary angiography). In 
contrast, the initial ischemia-guided strategy calls for an inva-
sive evaluation for those patients who 1) fail medical therapy 
(refractory angina or angina at rest or with minimal activity 
despite vigorous medical therapy), 2) have objective evidence 
of ischemia (dynamic electrocardiographic changes, myo-
cardial perfusion defect) as identified on a noninvasive stress test, or 3) have clinical indicators of very high prognostic risk (eg, high TIMI or GRACE scores). In both strategies, patients should receive optimal anti-ischemic and antithrombotic medical therapy as outlined in Section 4.1. A subgroup of patients with refractory ischemic symptoms or hemodynamic or rhythm instability are candidates for urgent coronary angi-
ography and revascularization.
4.4.2. Rationale and Timing for Early Invasive Strategy
This strategy seeks to rapidly risk stratify patients by assess-
ing their coronary anatomy. The major advantages of invasive therapy when appropriate are 1) the rapid and definitive nature 
of the evaluation, 2) the potential for earlier revascularization in appropriate patients that might prevent occurrence of fur -
ther complications of ACS that could ensue during medical 
therapy, and 3) facilitation of earlier discharge from a facility.
4.4.2.1. Routine Invasive Strategy Timing
The optimal timing of angiography has not been conclusively defined. In general, 2 options have emerged: early invasive 
(ie, within 24 hours) or delayed invasive (ie, within 25 to 72 
hours). In most studies using the invasive strategy, angiogra-
phy was deferred for 12 to 72 hours while antithrombotic and anti-ischemic therapies were intensified.
138,332–337 The concept 
of deferred angiography espouses that revascularization may 
be safer once plaque is stabilized with optimal antithrombotic and/or anti-ischemic therapies. Conversely, early angiography 
facilitates earlier risk stratification and consequently speeds 
revascularization and discharge but can place greater logistic 
demands on a healthcare system.
4.4.3. Rationale for Ischemia-Guided Strategy
The ischemia-guided strategy seeks to avoid the routine 
early use of invasive procedures unless patients experience 
refractory or recurrent ischemic symptoms or develop hemo-
dynamic instability. When the ischemia-guided strategy is 
chosen, a plan for noninvasive evaluation is required to detect 
severe ischemia that occurs at a low threshold of stress and to 
promptly refer these patients for coronary angiography and 
revascularization as indicated. The major advantage offered 
by the ischemia-guided strategy is that some patients’ con-
ditions stabilize during medical therapy and will not require 
coronary angiography and revascularization. Consequently, 
the ischemia-guided strategy may potentially avoid costly and 
possibly unnecessary invasive procedures.
4.4.4. Early Invasive and Ischemia-Guided Strategies: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. An urgent/immediate invasive strategy (diagnostic 
angiography with intent to perform revascularization 
if appropriate based on coronary anatomy) is indi-
cated in patients (men and women¶) with NSTE-ACS who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or elec-
trical instability (without serious comorbidities or 
contraindications to such procedures).
42,44,138,338 (Level 
of Evidence: A)
2. An early invasive strategy (diagnostic angiography 
with intent to perform revascularization if appropri-
ate based on coronary anatomy) is indicated in ini-tially stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS (without 
serious comorbidities or contraindications to such 
procedures) who have an elevated risk for clinical 
events (Table 8).

1. It is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy 
(within 24 hours of admission) over a delayed inva-
sive strategy (within 25 to 72 hours) for initially sta-
bilized high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS. For those not at high/intermediate risk, a delayed invasive ap-
proach is reasonable.139 (Level of Evidence: B)

indications to this approach) who have an elevated risk for clinical events.
333,334,338 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. The decision to implement an ischemia-guided strat-
egy in initially stabilized patients (without serious 
comorbidities or contraindications to this approach) may be reasonable after considering clinician and patient preference. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class III: No Benefit
1. An early invasive strategy (ie, diagnostic angiogra-phy with intent to perform revascularization) is not 
recommended in patients with:
 a.  Extensive comorbidities (eg, hepatic, renal, pulmo-nary failure; cancer), in whom the risks of revascular -
ization and comorbid conditions are likely to outweigh 
the benefits of revascularization. (Level of Evidence: C)
 b.  Acute chest pain and a low likelihood of ACS who are troponin-negative (Level of Evidence: C), espe-
cially women.
141 (Level of Evidence: B)
Several studies93,138,334–337 and meta-analyses141, 340 have con-
cluded that a strategy of routine invasive therapy is generally superior to an ischemia-guided strategy or selectively invasive approach. One study reported that the routine invasive strategy resulted in an 18% relative reduction in death or MI, including a significant reduction in MI alone.
341 The routine invasive arm was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (1.8% versus 
1.1%), but this disadvantage was more than compensated for by 
a significant reduction in mortality between discharge and the 
end of follow-up (3.8% versus 4.9%). The invasive strategy was 
also associated with less angina and fewer rehospitalizations. 
Patients undergoing routine invasive treatment also had improved 
quality of life. In an analysis of individual patient data340 that 
reported 5-year outcomes from the FRISC (Framingham and 
Fast Revascularization During Instability in Coronary Artery 
Disease)-II trial,339 ICTUS (Invasive Versus Conservative 
Treatment in Unstable Coronary Syndromes) trial,338 and RITA 
(Randomized Trial of a Conservative Treatment Strategy Versus 
an Interventional Treatment Strategy in Patients with Unstable 
Angina)-3 trial,334 14.7% of patients (389 of 2721) randomized 
to a routine invasive strategy experienced cardiovascular death 
or nonfatal MI versus 17.9% of patients (475 of 2746) in the 
selective invasive strategy (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.93; 
P=0.002). The most marked treatment effect was on MI (10.0% 
routine invasive strategy versus 12.9% selective invasive strat-egy), and there were consistent trends for fewer cardiovascular 
deaths (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.01; P =0.068) and all-cause 
mortality (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.05). There were abso-lute reductions of 2.0% to 3.8% in cardiovascular death or MI 
in the low- and intermediate-risk groups and an 11.1% absolute 
risk reduction in the highest-risk patients. The invasive strategy 
demonstrated its greatest advantage in the highest-risk stratum of patients with no significant benefit on mortality over the 
noninvasive approach in moderate- and low-risk patients.
342 An 
ischemia-guided strategy has been used with favorable results in initially stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS at elevated risk for 
clinical events, including those with positive troponin levels.
338 
One limitation of these studies is the absence of adherence to optimal medical therapy in non-invasively treated patients dur -
ing long-term management. In addition, in FRISC-II, invasive 
management was delayed and patients with markedly positive 
stress tests (up to 2.9-mm exercise-induced ST depression) were 
randomized to noninvasive or invasive therapy.
338
See Online Data Supplement 18 for additional information 
on comparison of early invasive strategy and ischemia-guided 
strategy.
4.4.4.1. Comparison of Early Versus Delayed Angiography
In some studies, early angiography and coronary intervention 
have been more effective in reducing ischemic complications than 
delayed interventions, particularly in patients at high risk (defined 
by a GRACE score >140).139,336 A more delayed strategy is also 
reasonable in low- to intermediate-risk patients. The advantage of early intervention was achieved in the context of intensive back-ground antithrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy. However, this question was also assessed by a meta-analysis of 11 trials (7 RCTs 
and 4 observational studies).
343 Meta-analysis of the RCTs was 
inconclusive for a survival benefit of the early invasive strategy 
(OR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.64 to 1.09]; P =0.180), and there were no sig-
nificant differences in MI or major bleeding; a similar result was found with the observational studies. These data are limited by the small sample size of the individual trials, low event rates, inconsis-
tency in timing of intervention, and heterogeneous patient profiles.

4.4.5. Subgroups: Early Invasive Strategy Versus Ischemia-
Guided Strategy
The TACTICS-TIMI (Treat Angina With Tirofiban and Determine Cost of Therapy With an Invasive or Conservative 
Strategy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) 18 trial 
demonstrated a reduction in the 6-month endpoint of death or MI in older adults with ACS.
138 Controversy exists over revas-
cularization treatment differences between men and women with ACS. The FRISC-II trial showed a benefit of revascu-larization in men for death or MI that was not observed for women.
344 In contrast, death, MI, or rehospitalization rates 
were reduced for both men and women in TACTICS-TIMI 
18.138 RITA-3 showed that the routine strategy of invasive 
evaluation resulted in a beneficial effect in high-risk men that 
was not seen in women.342 A meta-analysis suggests that in 
NSTE-ACS, an invasive strategy has a comparable benefit in 
men and high-risk women for reducing the composite end-
point of death, MI, or rehospitalization.141,345,346 In contrast, an 
ischemia-guided strategy is preferred in low-risk women.141 
Another collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials reported that an early invasive strategy yielded similar RR reductions in overall cardiovascular events in patients with 
and without diabetes mellitus.
347 However, an invasive strat-
egy appeared to reduce recurrent nonfatal MI to a greater 
extent in patients with diabetes mellitus.
4.4.6. Care Objectives
Coronary angiography is designed to provide detailed infor -
mation about the size and distribution of coronary vessels, 
the location and extent of atherosclerotic obstruction, and the 
suitability for revascularization. The LV angiogram, usually performed with coronary angiography, provides an assess-ment of the extent of focal and global LV dysfunction and of the presence and severity of coexisting disorders (eg, valvular or other associated lesions). Patients with NSTE-ACS can be divided into risk groups on the basis of their initial clinical presentation. The TIMI, PURSUIT, and GRACE scores are 
useful tools for assigning risk to patients with NSTE-ACS.
Risk stratification identifies patients who are most likely to 
benefit from subsequent revascularization. Patients with left 
main disease or multivessel CAD with reduced LV function are at high risk for adverse outcomes and are likely to benefit from CABG. Clinical evaluation and noninvasive testing aid in the identification of most patients at high risk because they often have ≥1 of the following high-risk features: advanced 
age (>70 years of age), prior MI, revascularization, ST devia-tion, HF, depressed resting LV function (ie, LVEF ≤0.40) on 
noninvasive study, or noninvasive stress test findings, includ-
ing magnetic resonance imaging.
348 Any of these risk factors 
or diabetes mellitus may aid in the identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from an invasive strategy.
Some patients with NSTE-ACS are not in the very high-
risk group and do not have findings that portend a high risk 
for adverse outcomes. They are not likely to receive the same 
degree of benefit from routine revascularization afforded to high-risk patients, and an invasive study is optional for those at lower risk and can be safely deferred pending further clinical evidence. Decisions about coronary angiography in patients who are not at high risk according to findings on clinical examination and noninvasive testing can be individualized on 
the basis of patient preferences and/or symptoms.
4.5. Risk Stratification Before Discharge for Patients 
With an Ischemia-Guided Strategy of NSTE-ACS: Recommendations
Class I
1. Noninvasive stress testing is recommended in low- 
and intermediate-risk patients who have been free of ischemia at rest or with low-level activity for a mini-
mum of 12 to 24 hours.
349–353 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Treadmill exercise testing is useful in patients able 
to exercise in whom the ECG is free of resting ST 
changes that may interfere with interpretation.349–352 
(Level of Evidence: C)
3. Stress testing with an imaging modality should be 
used in patients who are able to exercise but have ST changes on resting ECG that may interfere with in-terpretation. In patients undergoing a low-level ex-ercise test, an imaging modality can add prognostic 
information.
349–352 (Level of Evidence: B)
4. Pharmacological stress testing with imaging is rec-
ommended when physical limitations preclude ad-equate exercise stress. (Level of Evidence: C)
5. A noninvasive imaging test is recommended to evalu-
ate LV function in patients with definite ACS.
349–352 
(Level of Evidence: C)
The management of patients with NSTE-ACS requires con-
tinuous risk stratification. Important prognostic information is derived from initial assessment, the patient’s course during the 
early days of management, and the response to anti-ischemic 
and antithrombotic therapy. The choice of stress test is based on the patient’s resting ECG and ability to exercise, local 
expertise, and available technologies. The exercise intensity 
of the treadmill test (low level or symptom-limited) is used at the discretion of the attending clinician based on individ-
ual patient assessment. For invasively managed patients with 
residual nonculprit lesions, additional evaluation may be indi-cated to ascertain the significance of such lesions. Refer to the 
PCI CPG for additional details.
26
4.5.1. Noninvasive Test Selection
The goals of noninvasive testing in patients with a low or 
intermediate likelihood of CAD and high-risk patients who 
did not have an early invasive strategy are to detect ischemia and estimate prognosis. This information guides further diag-
nostic steps and therapeutic measures.
Because of its simplicity, lower cost, and widespread famil-
iarity with its performance and interpretation, the standard low-level exercise electrocardiographic stress test remains the most 
reasonable test in patients who are able to exercise and who have a resting ECG that is interpretable for ST shifts. There is evidence that imaging studies are superior to exercise elec-
trocardiographic evaluation in women for diagnosis of CAD.
350 
However, for prognostic assessment in women, treadmill exer -
cise testing has provided comparable results to stress imag-
ing.354 Patients with an electrocardiographic pattern that would 
interfere with interpretation of the ST segment (baseline ST

changes, intraventricular conduction defect, paced rhythm, pre-excitation, and digoxin) should have an exercise test with 
imaging. Patients who are unable to exercise should have a 
pharmacological stress test with imaging. Low- and intermedi-
ate-risk patients with NSTE-ACS may undergo symptom-lim-
ited stress testing, provided they have been asymptomatic and clinically stable at 12 to 24 hours for those with UA and 2 to 5 days for patients at similar risk with NSTEMI.
349 The optimal 
testing strategy in women is less well defined than in men.
4.5.2. Selection for Coronary Angiography
In contrast to noninvasive tests, coronary angiography provides 
detailed structural information for assessment of prognosis 
and appropriate management. When combined with LV angi-
ography, it also provides an assessment of global and regional LV function. Coronary angiography is usually indicated in patients with NSTE-ACS who have recurrent symptoms or ischemia despite adequate medical therapy or who are at high risk as categorized by clinical findings (HF, serious ventricular arrhythmias), noninvasive test findings (significant LV dysfunc-tion with EF <0.40, large anterior or multiple perfusion defects or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, high-risk Duke treadmill score ≤ −11), high-risk TIMI or GRACE scores, 
or markedly elevated troponin levels. Patients with NSTE-ACS who have had previous PCI or CABG should also be considered for early coronary angiography, unless prior coronary angiog-raphy data indicate that no further revascularization is feasible.
The general indications for coronary angiography and 
revascularization should be tempered by individual patient characteristics and preferences (a patient-centered approach). Patient and clinician judgments about risks and benefits are important for patients who might not be candidates for cor -
onary revascularization, such as very frail older adults and 
those with serious comorbid conditions (eg, severe hepatic, 
pulmonary, or renal failure; active or inoperable cancer).
See Online Data Supplement 20 for additional information 
on risk stratification.
5. Myocardial Revascularization
Recommendations about coronary artery revascularization indications, benefits, and choice of revascularization proce-dure (PCI or CABG) for all anatomic subsets have been pub-lished in the 2011 PCI CPG,
26 the 2011 CABG CPG,23 and the 
2012 stable ischemic heart disease CPG and its 2014 focused update.
10,11 The main difference between management of 
patients with stable ischemic heart disease and NSTE-ACS is a stronger impetus for revascularization in those with NSTE-
ACS. Myocardial ischemia in ACS may progress to MI and 
is potentially life threatening. In addition, in patients with 
ACS, angina (including recurrent angina) is more likely to be 
reduced by revascularization than by medical therapy.
26
A “heart team” approach to revascularization deci-
sions, involving an interventional cardiologist and cardio-thoracic surgeon, is used in patients with unprotected left main or complex CAD. Calculation of SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) and STS scores is reasonable in these 
patients to guide the choice of revascularization.
23,26,355Factors that influence the choice of revascularization pro-
cedure include the extent and complexity of CAD; short-term 
risk and long-term durability of PCI; operative mortality 
(which can be estimated by the STS score); diabetes mellitus; 
CKD; completeness of revascularization; LV systolic dys-
function; previous CABG; and the ability of the patient to tol-erate and comply with DAPT. In general, the greater the extent 
and complexity of the multivessel disease, the more com-
pelling the choice of CABG over multivessel PCI.
23,26,356–358  
In patients with NSTE-ACS, PCI of a culprit unprotected left 
main coronary artery lesion is an option if the patient is not a 
candidate for CABG.23,26
See Online Data Supplements 21 and 22 for additional 
information on myocardial revascularization.
5.1. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
5.1.1. PCI—General Considerations: Recommendation
Class IIb
1. A strategy of multivessel PCI, in contrast to cul-
prit lesion–only PCI, may be reasonable in pa-
tients undergoing coronary revascularization as part of treatment for NSTE-ACS.
330,359–364 (Level of 
 Evidence: B)
Approximately half of all PCI procedures are performed in 
patients with UA or NSTEMI, and approximately 32% to 40% of patients with NSTE-ACS will undergo PCI.
365 As 
discussed previously, in patients with NSTE-ACS, a strategy of early angiography and revascularization (primarily with PCI) results in lower rates of recurrent UA, recurrent reho-
spitalization, MI, and death.
366,367 Although PCI of a noncul-
prit lesion is not advocated in patients with STEMI,26 there is 
less agreement on whether nonculprit lesions should undergo intervention at the time of culprit-lesion PCI for NSTE-ACS. 
Most reports,
359–364 but not all,330 comparing culprit lesion–
only PCI with multivessel PCI (eg, PCI of multiple vessels performed at the same time) in patients with NSTE-ACS did not find an increased risk of MACE with multivessel PCI and 
found a reduction in the need for repeat revascularization. 
However, the data consist predominantly of post hoc analysis 
of nonrandomized data with variable duration of follow-up. 
This question has not been resolved and is an area of current investigation.
5.1.2. PCI—Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy5.1.2.1. Oral and Intravenous Antiplatelet Agents: 
Recommendations

5. In patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features 
(eg, elevated troponin) not adequately pretreated 
with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, it is useful to adminis-
ter a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, double-bolus eptifibatide, or high-dose bolus tirofiban) at the time 
of PCI.
379–382 (Level of Evidence: A)
6. In patients receiving a stent (bare-metal stent or 
drug-eluting stent [DES]) during PCI for NSTE-
ACS, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for at 
least 12 months.330 Options include:
 a.  Clopidogrel: 75 mg daily296,331 (Level of Evidence: 
B) or
 b. Prasugrel#: 10 mg daily302 (Level of Evidence: B) or
 c.  Ticagrelor║: 90 mg twice daily293 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to choose ticagrelor over clopido-
grel for P2Y12 inhibition treatment in patients with 
NSTE-ACS treated with an early invasive strategy 
and/or coronary stenting.293,294 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. It is reasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for P2Y
12 treatment in patients with NSTE-ACS who 
undergo PCI who are not at high risk of bleeding 
complications.302,303 (Level of Evidence: B)
3. In patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features 
(eg, elevated troponin) treated with UFH and ad-
equately pretreated with clopidogrel, it is reasonable 
to administer a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, 
double-bolus eptifibatide, or high-bolus dose tirofi-
ban) at the time of PCI.195,383,384 (Level of Evidence: B)
4. After PCI, it is reasonable to use 81 mg per day of aspirin in preference to higher maintenance dos-es.
331,368,385–388 (Level of Evidence: B)
5. If the risk of morbidity from bleeding outweighs the anticipated benefit of a recommended duration of 
P2Y
12 inhibitor therapy after stent implantation, ear -
lier discontinuation (eg, <12 months) of P2Y12 inhibi-
tor therapy is reasonable.330 (Level of Evidence: C)

1. Continuation of DAPT beyond 12 months may be considered in patients undergoing stent implanta-
tion. (Level of Evidence: C)Class III: Harm
1. Prasugrel should not be administered to patients 
with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic 
attack.302 (Level of Evidence: B)
Comprehensive recommendations on the use of antiplatelet 
and anticoagulant therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS under -
going PCI are given in the 2011 PCI CPG.26 Aspirin reduces the 
frequency of ischemic complications after PCI and is ideally 
administered at least 2 hours, and preferably 24 hours, before 
PCI.26,368,369 DAPT, consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, 
in patients treated with coronary stents reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and composite ischemic events.
296,331,372–375,389,390 
Compared with a loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel, a load-ing dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI 
achieves greater platelet inhibition with fewer low responders and decreases the incidence of MACE.
376–378 In patients with 
ACS who have undergone coronary stenting, treatment with prasugrel or ticagrelor, compared with treatment with clopi-
dogrel, results in a greater reduction in composite ischemic 
events and the incidence of stent thrombosis, although at a risk of increased non–CABG bleeding.
293,302 The optimal dura-
tion of DAPT therapy in patients treated with DES is not well 
established.26 However, aspirin is continued indefinitely in all 
patients managed with a bare-metal stent or DES, and DAPT is an option for >12 months in patients who have received a DES. 
This determination should balance the risks of stent thrombo-sis and ischemic complications versus bleeding and should be 
jointly made by the clinician and the patient.
Loading and short-term maintenance doses of clopi-
dogrel were studied in CURRENT–OASIS (Clopidogrel 
Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent Events–Organization to Assess Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes) 
7, which demonstrated a potential benefit of higher-dose 
clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose, 150 mg daily for 6 days, 
75 mg daily thereafter) in patients with NSTE-ACS under -
going an invasive management strategy.
292,391 Although the 
overall trial292 failed to demonstrate a significant difference 
in the primary endpoint between the clopidogrel and aspirin groups (4.2% versus 4.4%), the PCI subset (n=17 263) showed 
significant differences in the clopidogrel arm.
391 Notably, the 
higher-dose clopidogrel therapy increased major bleeding in the entire group (2.5% versus 2.0%; P=0.012) and the PCI 
subgroup (1.1% versus 0.7%; P=0.008). In addition, during the period of several hours required for conversion of clopi-
dogrel to its active metabolite, there is reduced effectiveness. 
However, efficacy is restored following conversion.
Patients undergoing PCI who have previously received a 
loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel and are on a 75-mg 
daily maintenance dose should receive another 300-mg 
loading dose.
315 There are no data appropriate for prasugrel 
because this drug is administered before PCI. For ticagrelor, there are no data on additional loading.

elevated troponin) who are not adequately pretreated #Patients should receive a loading dose of prasugrel, provided that they

with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, it is useful to administer 
a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, double-bolus ep-tifibatide, or high-dose bolus tirofiban) at the time of PCI.
379–382 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class IIa
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features (eg, elevated troponin) treated with UFH and ad-equately pretreated with clopidogrel, it is reasonable to administer a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, double-bolus eptifibatide, or high-dose bolus tirofi-
ban) at the time of PCI.
195,383 (Level of Evidence: B)
GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy in patients with 
NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI reduced the incidence of com-posite ischemic events, primarily through a decrease in 
documented MI, although in some trials this is counter -
balanced by an increased rate of bleeding.
193,195,310,379–382,392 
Most, but not all, randomized trials of the use of GP IIb/IIIa  
inhibitor were conducted in the era before clopidogrel 
therapy.193,195,310,379–383,392 Abciximab, double-bolus eptifiba-
tide, and high-bolus dose tirofiban result in a high degree of 
platelet inhibition, reduce ischemic complications in patients 
undergoing PCI, and appear to afford comparable angio-graphic and clinical outcomes.
26 As trials of the GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors generally excluded patients at high risk of bleed-
ing, recommendations for the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
are best understood as applying to patients not at high risk of bleeding complications. Although GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were used in 27% and 55% of patients, respectively, in the PLATO 
(Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) and TRITON 
studies of ticagrelor and prasugrel, there are insufficient data
293,302,393 (and no RCT data) from which to make specific 
recommendations about GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use in patients 
treated with either of these P2Y12 inhibitors.
See Online Data Supplement 21 for additional information 
on GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
5.1.2.3. Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients Undergoing PCI: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. An anticoagulant should be administered to patients 
with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI to reduce the risk of intracoronary and catheter thrombus formation. (Level of Evidence: C)
2. Intravenous UFH is useful in patients with NSTE-
ACS undergoing PCI. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. Bivalirudin is useful as an anticoagulant with or 
without prior treatment with UFH in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI.
310,394–398 (Level of Evi-
dence: B)
4. An additional dose of 0.3 mg/kg IV enoxaparin should be administered at the time of PCI to pa-tients with NSTE-ACS who have received fewer 
than 2 therapeutic subcutaneous doses (eg, 1 mg/kg  
SC) or received the last subcutaneous enoxaparin 
dose 8 to 12 hours before PCI.
309,399–403 (Level of Evi-
dence: B)5. If PCI is performed while the patient is on 
fondaparinux, an additional 85 IU/kg of UFH should 
be given intravenously immediately before PCI be-
cause of the risk of catheter thrombosis (60 IU/kg IV if a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used with UFH dosing 
based on the target-activated clotting time).
26,313–315,404 
(Level of Evidence: B)
6. In patients with NSTE-ACS, anticoagulant therapy 
should be discontinued after PCI unless there is a 
compelling reason to continue such therapy. (Level of 
Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. In patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI who are 
at high risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to use bivali-
rudin monotherapy in preference to the combination of UFH and a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist.
310,396 
(Level of Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. Performance of PCI with enoxaparin may be reason-able in patients treated with upstream subcutaneous 
enoxaparin for NSTE-ACS.
26,309,399–402,405,406 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
Class III: Harm
1. Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole an-ticoagulant to support PCI in patients with NSTE-
ACS due to an increased risk of catheter thrombo-sis.
26,313–315 (Level of Evidence: B)
Anticoagulant therapy prevents thrombus formation at the 
site of arterial injury, on the coronary guide wire, and in the 
catheters used for PCI.26,407 With rare exceptions, all PCI 
studies have used some form of anticoagulant at the time of PCI.
26 Intravenous UFH and bivalirudin both have Class 
I recommendations in patients undergoing PCI in the 2011 PCI CPG.
26 Patients who have received multiple doses of 
subcutaneously-administered enoxaparin who undergo PCI within 8 hours of the last subcutaneous dose generally have 
received adequate anticoagulation to undergo PCI, but the 
degree of anticoagulation may diminish 8 to 12 hours after 
the last subcutaneous dose. In such patients, as well as in patients who have received fewer than 2 subcutaneous doses 
of enoxaparin, the addition of enoxaparin (0.3 mg/kg IV) at 
the time of PCI provides additional anticoagulation and has 
become standard practice.
26,309,399–403 Patients who undergo 
PCI >12 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of enoxa-
parin are usually treated with full-dose de novo anticoagu-lation with an established regimen (eg, full-dose UFH or 
bivalirudin). Fondaparinux as the sole anticoagulant during PCI has been associated with catheter thrombosis, and use 
of an anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity is recommended when patients treated with fondaparinux undergo PCI.
313–315 
One suggested regimen is UFH 85 IU/kg IV if no GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitor is used and 60 IU/kg IV if a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is 
used with UFH dosing based on the target-activated clotting 
time314,404 (Table 9).26,313–315

5.2. Timing of Urgent CABG in Patients With 
NSTE-ACS in Relation to Use of Antiplatelet Agents: Recommendations

should be administered preoperatively to patients undergoing CABG.
408–410 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. In patients referred for elective CABG, clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be discontinued for at least 5 days before surgery

and prasugrel for at least 7 days before surgery.8,414 
(Level of Evidence: C)
3. In patients referred for urgent CABG, clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be discontinued for at least 24 hours to reduce major bleeding.
8,412,415–417 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
4. In patients referred for CABG, short-acting intrave-nous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide or tirofiban) should be discontinued for at least 2 to 4 hours before surgery
418,419 and abciximab for at least 12 hours be-
fore to limit blood loss and transfusion.389 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
Class IIb
1. In patients referred for urgent CABG, it may be reasonable to perform surgery less than 5 days after clopidogrel or ticagrelor has been discontinued and less than 7 days after prasugrel has been discontin-ued. (Level of Evidence: C)
In-hospital CABG is performed in 7% to 13% of patients 
hospitalized with NSTE-ACS.
420–422 Approximately one third of patients with NSTEMI undergo CABG within 48 hours of 
hospital admission.421 In these patients, CABG was performed 
at a median time of 73 hours after admission (interquartile 
range: 42 to 122 hours).421 In-hospital mortality in patients 
with NSTEMI undergoing CABG is approximately 3.7%.421
Recommendations for management of patients treated 
with oral and intravenous antiplatelet agents who undergo CABG are given in the 2011 CABG CPG.
23 Preoperative 
aspirin reduces operative morbidity and mortality, and CABG can be performed safely in patients on aspirin therapy with 
only a modest increase in bleeding risk.
23,408–410 The use of 
P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS is associated 
with an increase in post–CABG bleeding and the need for 
transfusion.293,302,411,413,423–425 Although it is recommended that 
clopidogrel and ticagrelor be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery and prasugrel at least 7 days before surgery 
in patients referred for elective CABG,
23,411–413 the timing 
of CABG in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with a P2Y12 
inhibitor330 should reflect a balance of the potential increase 
in bleeding against the potential benefits of not delaying sur -
gery 5 to 7 days. The risk of major bleeding complications is increased when CABG is performed <24 hours after dis-
continuation of clopidogrel.
23,416,417 In patients who undergo 
CABG 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of clopidogrel, it 
appears that the incidence of life-threatening bleeding is not 
significantly increased, but an increase in blood transfusions is  
likely.23,415,416,425,426 In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial,302 the inci-
dence of CABG-related major bleeding was higher in patients treated with prasugrel than in patients treated with clopido-
grel.
23,386 In the PLATO trial, the rates of major bleeding and 
transfusion requirements were similar between patients treated with ticagrelor and patients treated with clopidogrel.

6. Late Hospital Care, Hospital Discharge, 
And Posthospital Discharge Care
6.1. General Principles (Cardioprotective Therapy 
and Symptom Management)
The goals of therapy after NSTE-ACS are to restore the patient 
to normal activities to the extent possible and to use the acute 
event to re-evaluate the plan of care, particularly lifestyle and risk factor modification. Aggressive risk factor modifications 
that can prolong survival should be the main goal of long-term 
management of patients with stable CAD. Patients presenting 
with NSTE-ACS represent a high-risk cohort in whom sec-
ondary cardiovascular disease prevention is likely to be par -
ticularly effective ( Table 10). Clinicians have an opportunity 
to provide evidence-based care to this high-risk cohort and to aggressively treat the underlying atherosclerotic process 
through lifestyle modification and effective pharmacological 
therapies.
427 In most cases, the inpatient anti-ischemic medi-
cal regimen should be continued after discharge, and the anti-platelet/anticoagulant medications should be changed to an outpatient regimen. The goals for continued medical therapy 
after discharge relate to potential prognostic benefits (primar -
ily shown for antiplatelet agents, beta blockers, statins, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, espe-
cially for LVEF <0.40). Added benefits are control of ischemic 
symptoms (nitrates, beta blockers, CCBs, and ranolazine) and 
treatment of major risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes mel-
litus.
427 Selection of a medical regimen should be individual-
ized to each patient on the basis of in-hospital findings, risk factors for CAD, drug tolerability, and recent procedural inter -
ventions. The mnemonic “ABCDE” (Aspirin, Antianginals, 
and ACE Inhibitors; Beta Blockers and BP; Cholesterol 
and Cigarettes; Diet and Diabetes Mellitus; Education and 
Exercise) is useful in guiding treatment.
428
6.2. Medical Regimen and Use of Medications at 
Discharge: Recommendations
Class I
1. Medications required in the hospital to control isch-
emia should be continued after hospital discharge in patients with NSTE-ACS who do not undergo coro-nary revascularization, patients with incomplete or 
unsuccessful revascularization, and patients with re-
current symptoms after revascularization. Titration of the doses may be required.
427,428 (Level of Evidence: C)
2. All patients who are post–NSTE-ACS should be giv-en sublingual or spray nitroglycerin with verbal and 
written instructions for its use.
429 (Level of Evidence: C)
3. Before hospital discharge, patients with NSTE-ACS 
should be informed about symptoms of worsening myocardial ischemia and MI and should be given 
verbal and written instructions about how and when 
to seek emergency care for such symptoms.429 (Level 
of Evidence: C)
4. Before hospital discharge, patients who are post–NSTE-ACS and/or designated responsible caregiv-ers should be provided with easily understood and 
culturally sensitive verbal and written instructions 
about medication type, purpose, dose, frequency, side effects, and duration of use.
429 (Level of Evidence: C)
5. For patients who are post–NSTE-ACS and have ini-tial angina lasting more than 1 minute, nitroglycerin 
(1 dose sublingual or spray) is recommended if an-
gina does not subside within 3 to 5 minutes; call 9-1-1 immediately to access emergency medical services.
429 
(Level of Evidence: C)
6. If the pattern or severity of angina changes, suggest-
ing worsening myocardial ischemia (eg, pain is more 
frequent or severe or is precipitated by less effort or occurs at rest), patients should contact their clinician

ment or testing.

Therapy: Recommendations
Class I
1. Aspirin should be continued indefinitely. The mainte-
nance dose should be 81 mg daily in patients treated 
with ticagrelor and 81 mg to 325 mg daily in all other 
patients.288–290 (Level of Evidence: A)
2. In addition to aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopi-
dogrel or ticagrelor) should be continued for up to 
12 months in all patients with NSTE-ACS without 
contraindications who are treated with an ischemia-
guided strategy. Options include:
•	Clopidogrel: 75 mg daily289,296 (Level of Evidence:

•	Ticagrelor║: 90 mg twice daily293,294 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
3. In patients receiving a stent (bare-metal stent or 
DES) during PCI for NSTE-ACS, P2Y12 inhibitor 
therapy should be given for at least 12 months.330 
Options include:
•	Clopidogrel: 75 mg daily296,331 (Level of Evidence: 
B) or
•	Prasugrel#: 10 mg daily302 (Level of Evidence: B) or
•	Ticagrelor║: 90 mg twice daily293 (Level of Evi-
dence: B)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to use an aspirin maintenance dose of 81 mg per day in preference to higher maintenance 
║The recommended maintenance dose of aspirin to be used with 
ticagrelor is 81 mg daily.290

Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With NSTE-ACS
Class I
1. The duration of triple antithrombotic therapy with 
a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, and a P2Y12 recep-
tor inhibitor in patients with NSTE-ACS should be 
minimized to the extent possible to limit the risk of 
bleeding. (Level of Evidence: C)
2. Proton pump inhibitors should be prescribed in pa-tients with NSTE-ACS with a history of gastroin-testinal bleeding who require triple antithrombotic 
therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, and a 
P2Y
12 receptor inhibitor.26,430,431 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. Proton pump inhibitor use is reasonable in patients with NSTE-ACS without a known history of gastro-
intestinal bleeding who require triple antithrombotic 
therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, and a 
P2Y
12 receptor inhibitor.26,430,431 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIb
1. Targeting oral anticoagulant therapy to a lower in-
ternational normalized ratio (INR) (eg, 2.0 to 2.5) 
may be reasonable in patients with NSTE-ACS man-
aged with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor. (Level of 
Evidence: C)
The combination of oral antiplatelet therapy and oral anti-
coagulant therapy significantly increases the risk of bleed-
ing. This risk varies widely, but on average, the addition of a single antiplatelet agent increased the risk of bleeding from a 
range of 2% to 3% to a range of 4% to 6%, whereas the addi-
tion of DAPT to oral anticoagulant therapy (“triple therapy”) 
increased the risk of bleeding from a range of 4% to 6% to a 
range of 10% to 14%.
432–435 This risk was also related to the 
duration of triple therapy.
In patients with NSTE-ACS in whom there are indica-
tions for triple therapy, the benefit of such therapy in terms of prevention of stent thrombosis, thromboembolic events, 
and recurrent MI must be weighed against the risk of bleeding 
complications. Similarly, DAPT, in addition to anticoagulant Patient/family education

therapy, requires consideration of the increased risk of bleed-
ing. It is essential that therapeutic decision making in this crit-
ical area include discussion with the patient about the options, advantages, and limitations of available approaches.
Recommendations about the management of patients treated 
with triple therapy have been published in ACC/AHA CPGs and by other organizations.
17,26,430,433,436 Although some organi-
zations have recommended a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5 in patients 
with atrial fibrillation (AF) who require triple therapy,437 others 
continue to recommend a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.12,436 The HAS-
BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/
Alcohol Concomitantly) score has relevance in these delibera-tions.
439 No prospective study to date has demonstrated that a 
target INR of 2.0 to 2.5 reduces bleeding complications.
Whenever possible, shorter durations of triple therapy are 
favored in preference to longer durations of triple therapy. In patients with NSTE-ACS who require oral anticoagulation for 
AF, mechanical heart valve, deep venous thrombosis, or other 
conditions, a bare-metal stent may offer the advantages of lower bleeding risk over a DES because of the potentially shorter dura-
tion of triple antithrombotic therapy. The WOEST (What is the 
Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) trial is the first published study to address the question of optimal antiplate-
let therapy in patients taking oral anticoagulant medication.
440 
WOEST was a randomized, open-label trial of 563 patients (approximately 25% of whom had NSTE-ACS) receiving oral 
anticoagulant therapy and undergoing coronary stenting. Patients randomized to single antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel had 
significantly fewer bleeding complications and no increase in 
thrombotic events compared with those randomized to DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel. Larger clinical trials are needed to compare double versus triple therapy in the setting of coronary 
stenting and NSTE-ACS. One such study that has been initiated 
is PIONEER AF-PCI (an Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring two Treatment Strategies of 
Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist 
Treatment Strategy in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention).
Although there are some data on therapy with aspirin, clop-
idogrel, and warfarin, there is sparse information on the use of newer P2Y
12 inhibitors (prasugrel, ticagrelor), direct thrombin 
inhibitor (dabigatran), or factor-Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, 
apixaban) in patients receiving triple therapy. Prasugrel302 
and ticagrelor412 produce a greater degree of platelet inhibi-
tion than clopidogrel and are associated with greater rates of bleeding.
300,302,412,441 These are important potential disadvan-
tages in patients requiring triple therapy, a group in which the 
inherent risks of bleeding are significantly increased. (Overall 
bleeding risk was not increased with ticagrelor, although there 
was increased bleeding in certain subgroups on this drug).412 
Because there are no well-established therapies to reverse the anticoagulant effects of the newer oral antiplatelet agents, caution is required when considering the use of these agents in patients who require triple therapy and are at significantly 
increased risk of bleeding. This admonition is especially 
important in elderly patients, a group in which bleeding risk is inherently increased (Section 7.1).Proton pump inhibitors decrease the risk of gastrointesti-
nal bleeding in patients treated with DAPT
431 and are used in 
patients treated with DAPT who have a history of gastrointes-
tinal bleeding and those at increased risk of bleeding, which is associated with oral anticoagulation therapy even if there is no history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
430 On the basis of 
these results, proton pump inhibitors are also used in patients receiving triple antithrombotic therapy who have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although the clinical evidence 
that omeprazole and esomeprazole diminish the antiplate-
let efficacy of clopidogrel is weak,
430 the US Food and Drug 
Administration has issued a warning to avoid concomitant use of these 2 proton pump inhibitors with clopidogrel.
442
6.2.3. Platelet Function and Genetic Phenotype TestingAlthough higher platelet reactivity has been associated with a greater incidence of adverse events in patients undergoing stent implantation, a strategy of adjusting antiplatelet therapy based on routine platelet function testing has not been ben-
eficial in reducing ischemic complications.
26,443–445 Similarly, 
a strategy of routine genetic phenotype testing has also not 
been beneficial and thus is not recommended.26,446–448 A more 
detailed discussion of these issues and current recommenda-tions about platelet function testing and genetic testing are in the 2011 PCI CPG.
26
6.3. Risk Reduction Strategies for Secondary 
Prevention
Secondary prevention is a critical aspect of the management of 
care for the survivor of NSTE-ACS. It has been clearly estab-lished that in this high-risk cohort, subsequent cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality can be reduced by a comprehensive 
approach to favorably modifying patients’ risk profiles.
27
Secondary prevention comprises lifestyle changes, risk fac-
tor education, medical therapy, and, where appropriate, revas-cularization. These elements are discussed in Section 6.4. 
Despite the proven utility of secondary prevention, its imple-
mentation remains suboptimal, and enhanced application is a major goal in this patient population.
See Online Data Supplement 23 for additional information 
on risk reduction strategies.
6.3.1. Cardiac Rehabilitation and Physical Activity: 
Recommendation
Class I
1. All eligible patients with NSTE-ACS should be re-
ferred to a comprehensive cardiovascular rehabilita-tion program either before hospital discharge or dur -
ing the first outpatient visit.
449–452 (Level of Evidence: B)
The US Public Health Service emphasizes comprehensive car -
diac rehabilitation programs,449 and the 2011 secondary pre-
vention CPG underscores referral to cardiac rehabilitation for 
survivors of ACS.27 Since 2007, referral to these programs has 
been designated a quality performance measure.453–455 Barriers 
to referral can be obviated by discussion with the patient and 
referral by the patient’s primary care clinician and/or cardio-vascular caregiver. These comprehensive programs provide patient education, enhance regular exercise, monitor risk

factors, and address lifestyle modification.456 Aerobic exercise 
training can generally begin 1 to 2 weeks after discharge in 
patients treated with PCI or CABG.457 Mild-to-moderate resis-
tance training can be considered and started 2 to 4 weeks after aerobic training.
458 Unsupervised exercise may target a heart 
rate range of 60% to 75% of maximum age-predicted heart rate based on the patient’s exercise stress test. Supervised training 
may target a higher heart rate (70% to 85% of age-predicted 
maximum).
457 Additional restrictions apply when residual isch-
emia is present. Daily walking can be encouraged soon after discharge for most patients. Resource publications on exer -
cise prescription in cardiovascular patients are available.
456,457 
Regular physical activity reduces symptoms in patients with 
cardiovascular disease, enhances functional capacity, improves 
other risk factors such as insulin resistance and glucose con-
trol, and is important in weight control.456 Questionnaires and 
nomograms for cardiac patients have been developed to guide exercise prescription if an exercise test is unavailable.
459–462 See 
Section 6.4 and Table 10 for more information.
6.3.2. Patient Education: Recommendations
Class I
1. Patients should be educated about appropriate cho-
lesterol management, BP, smoking cessation, and life-style management.
15,16,18 (Level of Evidence: C)
2. Patients who have undergone PCI or CABG derive benefit from risk factor modification and should receive counseling that revascularization does not 
obviate the need for lifestyle changes.
463 (Level of 
Evidence: C)
Results of testing should be discussed with the patient, the 
patient’s family, and/or the patient’s advocate in an under -
standable manner. Test results should be used to help deter -
mine the advisability of coronary angiography, the need for adjustments in the medical regimen, and the specifics for sec-
ondary prevention measures. See Section 6.4 and Table 10 for 
more information on plan of care.
6.3.3. Pneumococcal Pneumonia: Recommendation
Class I
1. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for 
patients 65 years of age and older and in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.
464–466 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
Vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccha-
ride vaccine is recommended for all adults ≥65 years of age. Adults of any age who are at increased risk, including smok-ers and those with asthma, should also be given the vaccine. Immunocompromised adults should receive the 13-valent conjugate vaccine in addition to the 23-valent vaccine.
464–466 
The influenza vaccine is discussed in Section 6.4.
6.3.4. NSAIDs: Recommendations
Class I
1. Before hospital discharge, the patient’s need for treat-
ment of chronic musculoskeletal discomfort should be assessed, and a stepped-care approach should be 
used for selection of treatments. Pain treatment be-
fore consideration of NSAIDs should begin with ac-
etaminophen, nonacetylated salicylates, tramadol, or small doses of narcotics if these medications are not 
adequate.
17,237 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to use nonselective NSAIDs, such 
as naproxen, if initial therapy with acetaminophen, 
nonacetylated salicylates, tramadol, or small doses of 
narcotics is insufficient.237 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIb
1. NSAIDs with increasing degrees of relative COX-2 selectivity may be considered for pain relief only for situations in which intolerable discomfort per -
sists despite attempts at stepped-care therapy with acetaminophen, nonacetylated salicylates, tramadol, small doses of narcotics, or nonselective NSAIDs. In all cases, use of the lowest effective doses for the 
shortest possible time is encouraged.
234,235,237,467 (Level 
of Evidence: C)
Class III: Harm
1. NSAIDs with increasing degrees of relative COX-
2 selectivity should not be administered to patients 
with NSTE-ACS and chronic musculoskeletal dis-
comfort when therapy with acetaminophen, nonac-etylated salicylates, tramadol, small doses of narcot-ics, or nonselective NSAIDs provide acceptable pain relief.
234,235,237,467 (Level of Evidence: B)
Selective COX-2 inhibitors and other nonselective NSAIDs 
have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and the risk appears to be amplified in patients with established. cardiovascular disease.
17,234,235,467,469 In a large Danish observa-
tional study of patients with first MI (n=58 432), the HR and 
95% CI for death were 2.80 (2.41 to 3.25) for rofecoxib, 2.57 (2.15 to 3.08) for celecoxib, 1.50 (1.36 to 1.67) for ibuprofen, 
2.40 (2.09 to 2.80) for diclofenac, and 1.29 (1.16 to 1.43) for 
other NSAIDs.
234 There were dose-related increases in risk 
of death and non–dose-dependent trends for rehospitaliza-tion for MI for all drugs.
234,467 An AHA scientific statement on 
the use of NSAIDs concluded that the risk of cardiovascular events is proportional to COX-2 selectivity and the underly-ing risk in the patient.
237 Non-pharmacological approaches 
were recommended as the first line of treatment, followed by the stepped-care approach to pharmacological therapy, as shown in Figure 4.
6.3.5. Hormone Therapy: Recommendation
Class III: Harm
1. Hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin, or 
estrogen alone, should not be given as new drugs for secondary prevention of coronary events to post-
menopausal women after NSTE-ACS and should

Amsterdam et al  2014 AHA/ACC NSTE-ACS Guideline  e381
not be continued in previous users unless the ben-
efits outweigh the estimated risks.17,470–472 (Level of 
Evidence: A)
Although prior observational data suggested a protective effect 
of hormone therapy for coronary events, a randomized trial 
of hormone therapy for secondary prevention of death and MI (the HERS [Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement] study) failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect.
473 There was 
an excess risk for death and MI early after initiation of hor -
mone therapy. The Women’s Health Initiative included random-ized primary prevention trials of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone.
472 Both trials were stopped early owing to an 
increased risk related to hormone therapy that was believed to outweigh the potential benefits of further study.
470–472 It is rec-
ommended that post-menopausal women receiving hormone therapy at the time of a cardiovascular event discontinue its use and that hormone therapy should not be initiated for the 
primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. However, 
there may be other permissible indications for hormone therapy in postmenopausal women (eg, treatment of perimenopausal symptoms such as flushing or prevention of osteoporosis) if the benefits are believed to outweigh the increased cardiovascular risk. Postmenopausal women who are >1 to 2 years past the ini-tiation of hormone therapy who wish to continue such therapy 
for another compelling indication should weigh the risks and 
benefits, recognizing the greater risk of cardiovascular events and breast cancer (combination therapy) or stroke (estrogen).
473
6.3.6. Antioxidant Vitamins and Folic Acid: 
Recommendations
Class III: No Benefit
1. Antioxidant vitamin supplements (eg, vitamins E, C, 
or beta carotene) should not be used for secondary 
prevention in patients with NSTE-ACS.474,475 (Level of 
Evidence: A)
2. Folic acid, with or without vitamins B6 and B12, should not be used for secondary prevention in pa-
tients with NSTE-ACS.
476,477 (Level of Evidence: A)
Although there is an association of elevated homocysteine 
blood levels and CAD, a reduction in homocysteine levels with routine folate supplementation did not reduce the risk of CAD 
events in 2 trials (the NORVIT [Norwegian Vitamin Trial] and the HOPE [Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation] study) 
that included post–MI or high-risk stable patients
476–478 and 
produced poorer outcomes in another study.479 Additionally, in 
the NORVIT trial, there was a trend toward increased cardio-
vascular events (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.50; P=0.05) in the cohort receiving the combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vita-min B12; the authors cautioned against using the treatment for secondary prevention.
476 Similarly, experience in large clinical 
trials with antioxidant vitamins has failed to demonstrate ben-efit for primary or secondary prevention.
474,475,480
See Online Data Supplement 23 for additional information 
on antioxidant vitamins and folic acid.
6.4. Plan of Care for Patients With NSTE-ACS: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. Posthospital systems of care designed to prevent 
hospital readmissions should be used to facilitate the transition to effective, coordinated outpatient care for all patients with NSTE-ACS.
481–485 (Level of 
Evidence: B)
2. An evidence-based plan of care (eg, GDMT) that pro-motes medication adherence, timely follow-up with 
the healthcare team, appropriate dietary and physi-
cal activities, and compliance with interventions for secondary prevention should be provided to patients with NSTE-ACS. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. In addition to detailed instructions for daily exer -
cise, patients should be given specific instruction on activities (eg, lifting, climbing stairs, yard work, and household activities) that are permissible and those to avoid. Specific mention should be made of resump-tion of driving, return to work, and sexual activ-
ity.
452,486,487 (Level of Evidence: B)
4. An annual influenza vaccination is recommended for 
patients with cardiovascular disease.27,488 (Level of 
Evidence: C)
Education of patients with NSTEMI and their families is criti-
cal and often challenging, especially during transitions of care. 
Failure to understand and comply with a plan of care may 
account for the high rate of AMI rehospitalization rates in the United States.

coordination is to provide patients and caregivers with a com-
prehensive plan of care and educational materials during the 
hospital stay that support compliance with evidence-based thera-
pies.491–493 The posthospitalization plan of care for patients with 
NSTE-ACS (Table 10) should address in detail several complex 
issues, including medication adherence and titration, timely 
follow-up, dietary interventions, physical and sexual activities, cardiac rehabilitation, compliance with interventions for second-ary prevention, and reassessment of arrhythmic and HF risks. 
In addition, clinicians should pay close attention to psychoso-
cial and socioeconomic issues, including access to care, risk of depression, social isolation, and healthcare disparities.
494–496
6.4.1. Systems to Promote Care Coordination
There has been improved understanding of the system changes 
necessary to achieve safer care.497 This includes adoption 
by all US hospitals of a standardized set of “Safe Practices” endorsed by the National Quality Forum,
498 which over -
lap with the National Patient Safety Goals espoused by The Joint Commission.
499 Examples of patient safety standards 
for all patients after AMI include improved communication 
among clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists; medication recon-
ciliation; careful transitions between care settings; and con-sistent documentation. The National Quality Forum has also endorsed a set of patient-centered “Preferred Practices for 
Care Coordination,”
500 which detail comprehensive specifica-
tions that are necessary to achieve successful care coordina-tion for patients and their families. Systems of care designed 
to support patients with NSTE-ACS, STEMI, and other car -
diac diseases can result in significant improvement in patient 
outcomes. Table 10 provides reference documents for multiple 
risk-reduction strategies for secondary prevention in the post-hospital phase of NSTE-ACS. These include the 2013 ACC/
AHA CPGs on management of blood cholesterol,
18 obesity,16 
and lifestyle15 and the 2014 recommendations for management 
of hypertension,501 which were published during the develop-
ment of this CPG. To provide the interventions and services listed in Table 10, appropriate resources must be used so that 
patients with MI have full access to evidence-based therapies and follow-up care. There is a growing emphasis on penalizing 
hospitals for avoidable hospital readmissions. It is imperative 
for health systems to work with clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, communities, payers, and public agencies to support the inter -
ventions that achieve comprehensive care. Several patient char -
acteristics have been predictors of readmission after AMI.

7. Special Patient Groups
See Table 11 for summary of recommendations for this 
section.
7.1. NSTE-ACS in Older Patients: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. Older patients** with NSTE-ACS should be treated 
with GDMT, an early invasive strategy, and revascu-
larization as appropriate.515–519 (Level of Evidence: A)2. Pharmacotherapy in older patients** with NSTE-
ACS should be individualized and dose adjusted by weight and/or CrCl to reduce adverse events caused by age-related changes in pharmacokinetics/dynam-ics, volume of distribution, comorbidities, drug inter -
actions, and increased drug sensitivity.
515,520–522 (Level

515,523–525 (Level

Class IIa
1. Bivalirudin, rather than a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus UFH, is reasonable in older patients** with NSTE-ACS, both initially and at PCI, given similar efficacy but less bleeding risk.
396,526–528 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. It is reasonable to choose CABG over PCI in older patients** with NSTE-ACS who are appropriate can-didates, particularly those with diabetes mellitus or complex 3-vessel CAD (eg, SYNTAX score >22), with or without involvement of the proximal LAD artery, to reduce cardiovascular disease events and readmission and to improve survival.
529–534 (Level of Evidence: B)
In this CPG, “older adults” refers to patients ≥ 75 years of age.515 
Older adults have the highest incidence, prevalence, and adverse 
outcomes of NSTE-ACS.9,515–517,535,536 Older age is accompanied 
by comorbidities, polypharmacy, and age- and disease-related physiological changes that adversely impact NSTE-ACS presen-
tation, management, and outcome. As older patients are under-
represented in clinical trials, the recommendations in this CPG are largely supported by registry data and meta-analyses.
516,537
Older patients with NSTE-ACS primarily present with chest 
pain but frequently have atypical symptoms. ECGs may be less diagnostic than in younger patients.
517,538 Older patients 
with NSTE-ACS derive the same or greater benefit from phar -
macological therapies, interventional therapies, and cardiac rehabilitation as younger patients, but older patients receive 
significantly less GDMT than younger patients, even when 
adjusted for comorbidities.
515–517,535,538,539 In the ACSIS (Acute 
Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey) registry, patients >80 years of age referred for early coronary angiography, compared with 
no angiography, had lower 30-day and 1-year mortality rates.
540
Age-related pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic 
changes can alter drug dosing, efficacy, and safety of 
many NSTE-ACS therapies, as can drug–drug interactions 
(Appendix 4, Table B).515,520,521,541,542 CrCl or glomerular filtra-
tion rate (GFR) should be estimated initially and throughout 
care for all older patients with NSTE-ACS, and pharmaceuti-cal agents should be renally and weight dose-adjusted to limit 
drug toxicity (especially bleeding risk), given the unreliabil-
ity of serum creatinine to assess age-related renal dysfunc-tion
515,522,526,543–545 (Appendix 4, Table C). Bleeding in older 
patients with NSTE-ACS is multifactorial, resulting in nar -
rower therapeutic windows.541,542,544,546,547

Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association Guidelines) study, excessive 
doses of UFH, LMWH, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors accounted for 15% of major bleeding, longer lengths of stay, and increased mortality.
522,548 Aspirin should be maintained at 81 mg per day 
(after initial stent implantation). Owing to excess bleeding 
without clinical benefit, the US Food and Drug Administration 
lists a Black Box warning that does not recommend adminis-tration of prasugrel to patients with NSTE-ACS who are ≥75 
years of age or weigh <60 kg except in those at very high 
risk. A metaanalysis of 6 RCTs about the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS reported no significant age-treatment interaction, although older women had signifi-cantly more adverse events.
549 Bivalirudin appears safer for 
older patients with NSTE-ACS ± PCI than GP IIb/IIIa inhibi-tors plus UFH, with less bleeding and similar efficacy.
526,550 
AF is more common in older patients with NSTE-ACS, and 
triple therapy (DAPT and warfarin) entails a marked bleeding 
risk.551 In the WOEST (What is the Optimal Antiplatelet and 
Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) study, it was found that in patients 
taking oral coagulants who required PCI, use of clopidogrel 
without aspirin was associated with a significant reduction 
in bleeding complications and no increase in thrombotic 
events.
440 Nonetheless, practice should not be changed on the 
basis of this limited study alone.
Older patients with NSTE-ACS benefit as much or more 
than younger patients from an early invasive strategy com-pared with an ischemia-guided strategy.
340,341,515,518,519 In a 
5-year follow-up meta-analysis of FRISC-II and RITA-3, an early invasive strategy versus an ischemia-guided strategy 
was associated with a significant reduction in death/MI and 
MI in patients ≥75 years of age but not in patients <65 years 
of age.
518 Although the highest risk reduction in death/MI with 
an early invasive strategy occurred in those ≥75 years of age, 
this strategy was associated with a 3-fold bleeding risk.552 
However, despite the overall favorable evidence for an early invasive strategy in older patients, age is the strongest risk fac-
tor for this group not undergoing an early invasive strategy.
553
PCI has increased in older patients, including the very 
elderly (≥90 years of age), with success rates similar to 
younger patients and declining complication rates, including 
major bleeding.515,517,526–528,554 Several large registries report a 
greater RR reduction in mortality of older patients treated with 
revascularization versus medical therapy compared with those 
≤65 years of age, despite increased comorbidities.517,540,554–556
Operative mortality rates for CABG in patients ≥80 years 
of age with NSTE-ACS range from 5% to 8% (11% for urgent cases) and increase to approximately 13% at ≥90 years of age. Complications occur more frequently in older patients with CABG.
557,558 Length of stay averages 6 days longer in older 
patients than in patients <50 years of age, and discharge (to 
home [52%]) is less frequent than in younger patients.557 In 
a metaanalysis, off-pump CABG appeared to offer a poten-
tially safer and more effective revascularization technique 
compared with on-pump CABG in older patients with NSTE-
ACS.559 Older patients with NSTE-ACS with diabetes mellitus 
had a greater survival advantage with CABG.529 Evaluation 
tools can help identify older patients with NSTE-ACS whose risk and comorbidity profile predict mortality within 6 to 12 
months and possibly guide a palliative approach.524
See Online Data Supplement 24 for additional information 
on older patients.
7.2. HF: Recommendations
Class I
1. Patients with a history of HF and NSTE-ACS should 
be treated according to the same risk stratification guidelines and recommendations for patients without 
HF.
14,42–44,75–81 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Selection of a specific revascularization strategy 
should be based on the degree, severity, and extent of CAD; associated cardiac lesions; the extent of 
LV dysfunction; and the history of prior revascu-larization procedures.
14,138,141,333,334,337,341,560,561 (Level of 
 Evidence: B)
In patients with HF and NSTE-ACS, the plan of care should 
be implemented as in patients without HF using medical 
therapy and an early invasive approach, because patients with 
abnormal LV function are at increased risk of mortality and 
morbidity.562 HF itself may be associated with elevated serum 
troponin in the presence or absence of obstructive CAD. After 
angiography, risk stratification can be used to select revascu-
larization strategies. The effect of surgical revascularization on improving survival has been most clearly demonstrated 
in patients with both extensive CAD and LV dysfunc-
tion.
356,357,563–567 Such patients should undergo testing to iden-
tify the severity and extent of ischemia and should in general 
be referred for coronary angiography. In selected patients with 
appropriate anatomy, PCI has been used.23,568 In patients who 
have already undergone CABG or in whom the anatomy is 
not favorable for CABG, PCI has been performed using CPG-
based PCI performance strategies if specific targeted areas that are amenable to PCI can be identified.
26 If there is a large 
amount of ischemic territory and very poor LV function, per -
cutaneous ventricular assist devices or, in less severe cases, an IABP can be used for support during the procedure.
266,569–573
See Online Data Supplement 25 for additional information 
on HF .
7.2.1. Arrhythmias
Ventricular arrhythmias are common early after onset of NSTE-ACS, and not all require intervention. The mechanisms 
for these arrhythmias include continuing ischemia, hemody-
namic and electrolyte abnormalities, reentry, and enhanced 
automaticity. Approximately 5% to 10% of hospitalized 
patients may develop ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF), usually within 48 hours of presentation.
574 
The incidence of VF in otherwise uncomplicated AMI appears 
to have decreased within the past few years from >4% to <2%, 
of which 59% of patients had non–Q-wave MI.574 A study 
of 277 consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS who under -
went cardiac catheterization within 48 hours found VT/VF  
occurring in 7.6% of patients, 60% of which developed within 48 hours after admission.
575 Risk factors for VT/VF 
include HF, hypotension, tachycardia, shock, and low TIMI flow grade. Treatment consists of immediate defibrillation or

cardioversion for VF or pulseless sustained VT. Early admin-
istration of beta blockers has been associated with reduction in incidence of VF.
576 The prophylactic use of lidocaine is not rec-
ommended. Although VT/VF is associated with higher 90-day mortality risk, premature ventricular contractions not associ-ated with hemodynamic compromise and accelerated ventric-ular rhythms do not confer higher mortality risks and do not require specific therapy other than maintaining electrolyte bal-
ance. NSTE-ACS non-sustained VT occurring >48 hours after 
admission indicates an increased risk of cardiac and sudden death, especially when associated with accompanying myo-cardial ischemia.
577 Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias 
that occur >48 hours after NSTE-ACS are usually associated with LV dysfunction and signify poor prognosis. RCTs in patients with ACS have shown consistent benefit of implant-able cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for survivors of VT or VF arrest.
578–582 For other at-risk patients, especially those with 
significantly reduced LVEF, candidacy for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with an implantable cardioverter-defi-brillator should be readdressed ≥40 days after discharge.
583 
A life vest may be considered in the interim.
AF, atrial flutter, and other supraventricular arrhythmias 
may be triggered by excessive sympathetic stimulation, atrial stress due to volume overload, atrial infarction, pericarditis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, or pulmonary disease. AF 
is the most common of these arrhythmias and may develop in 
>20% of patients. AF is associated with shock, HF, stroke, and increased 90-day mortality.
584 Management of AF requires rate 
control and adequate anticoagulation according to the 2014 AF CPG.
12 For hemodynamically unstable patients and those 
with continuing ischemia, treatment should be implemented according to the 2010 advanced cardiac life support CPGs.

*Provocative testing during invasive coronary angiography (eg, using ergonovine, acetylcholine, methylergonovine) is relatively safe, especially when performed 
in a controlled manner by experienced operators. However, sustained spasm, serious arrhythmias, and even death can also occur but very infrequently. Therefore, 
provocative tests should be avoided in patients with significant left main disease, advanced 3-vessel disease, presence of high-grade obstructive lesions, significant valvular stenosis, significant LV systolic dysfunction, and advanced HF.

Sinus bradycardia is especially common with inferior 
NSTEMI. Symptomatic or hemodynamically significant sinus 
bradycardia should be treated with atropine and, if not respon-
sive, temporary pacing. The incidence of complete heart block is 1.0% to 3.7% in NSTEMI, based on anterior or posterior/inferior location, respectively.
586 Atrioventricular block and bun-
dle-branch block develop in approximately 5% of patients.587 
High-degree atrioventricular block or bundle-branch block in anterior NSTEMI is more ominous because of a greater extent of myocardial injury and involvement of the conduction system.
587
First-degree atrioventricular block does not require treat-
ment. High-grade atrioventricular block after inferior NSTEMI usually is transient, with a narrow QRS complex 
and a junctional escape rhythm that can be managed with an 
ischemia-guided strategy. Prophylactic placement of a tem-porary pacemaker is recommended for high-grade atrioven-tricular block, new bundle-branch block, or bifascicular block 
with anterior infarction. Indications for permanent pacing are 
reviewed in the 2012 device-based therapy CPG.
20
7.2.2. Cardiogenic Shock: Recommendation
Class I
1. Early revascularization is recommended in suitable 
patients with cardiogenic shock due to cardiac pump failure after NSTE-ACS.
560,588,589 (Level of Evidence: B)
AMI is the leading cause of cardiogenic shock. Early revascular -
ization is a mainstay in the treatment of cardiogenic shock.560,589 
Compared with medical therapy, early revascularization is asso-
ciated with improved 6-month mortality560 and 13% absolute 
mortality reduction at 6 years.588 Urgent revascularization with 
CABG may be indicated for failed PCI, coronary anatomy not 
amenable to PCI, and at the time of surgical repair of a mechani-
cal defect (eg, septal, papillary muscle, free-wall rupture). Age alone is not a contraindication to urgent revascularization for cardiogenic shock.
589,590 Mortality after cardiogenic shock has 
steadily improved,591 including in older adults,589,590 with 30-day 
mortality ranging from approximately 40% with milder forms of 
shock268 to >45% with refractory shock.592 Approximately 30% 
of patients in the IABP-SHOCK (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump in 
Cardiogenic Shock) II trial presented with NSTEMI,268 and 22% 
of patients in the TRIUMPH (Tilarginine Acetate Injection in a Randomized International Study in Unstable Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients With Cardiogenic Shock) trial had ST depres-
sion on presentation.
592 Of the 23% of patients with ACS who 
had NSTEMI in the GRACE registry, 4.6% of patients experi-
enced cardiogenic shock.593 Of the 2992 patients in shock, 57% 
underwent cardiac catheterization, and in-hospital revasculariza-tion was performed in 47% of this group.
In-hospital mortality of all patients with shock was 59%.
594 
Patients with NSTEMI developed cardiogenic shock later than patients with STEMI, and had higher-risk clinical character -
istics, more extensive CAD, and more recurrent ischemia and 
infarction before developing shock compared with patients with 
STEMI, and shock developed later in patients with NSTEMI.
151 
Patients with NSTEMI constituted >17% of those in the SHOCK trial registry.
595 They were also older and had more comorbidi-
ties but had comparable mortality to patients with STEMI. The left circumflex coronary artery was the culprit vessel in 30% of patients with NSTEMI, suggesting the presence of true poste-
rior MI.
595 Dopamine in patients with cardiogenic shock may 
be associated with increased mortality compared with norepi-
nephrine.596 The use of percutaneous ventricular assist devices 
has been hampered by the need for interventional expertise, 
cost, and lack of supportive evidence.597 IABP has been used for 
decades,265,598 and it may facilitate intervention in patients who 
are hemodynamically unstable, but it did not reduce mortality or 
secondary endpoints in 1 RCT of 598 patients with cardiogenic 
shock complicating AMI.268 Newer devices with higher levels of 
support have provided better hemodynamic support but without 
improved clinical outcomes compared with IABP.599,600
See Online Data Supplement 26 for additional information 
on cardiogenic shock.
7.3. Diabetes Mellitus: Recommendation
Class I
1. Medical treatment in the acute phase of NSTE-ACS and 
decisions to perform stress testing, angiography, and re-vascularization should be similar in patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
138,339,601 (Level of Evidence: A)
CAD accounts for 75% of deaths in patients with diabetes mel-
litus; >30% of patients with NSTE-ACS have diabetes mellitus; and patients with NSTE-ACS and diabetes mellitus have more adverse outcomes (eg, death, MI, readmission with ACS, or HF) during follow up.
593,602,603 The latter may be related to increased 
plaque instability and comorbidities, including hypertension, LV hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, HF, and autonomic dysfunc-tion.
603–605 Patients with diabetes mellitus and ACS have longer 
delays from symptom onset to presentation,593,606,607 which may 
be attributable to their atypical symptoms.
There is a U-shaped relationship between glucose levels and 
mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and ACS.543 Both 
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have similar adverse effects on in-hospital and 6-month mortality. The urgency to aggressively 
control blood glucose has been moderated by the results of the 
NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regimen) trial.
608 In this 
study of patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care units, intensive glucose control (target 81 mg/dL to 108 mg/dL) resulted in increased all-cause mortality and hypoglycemia com-
pared with moderate glucose control (target <l80 mg/dL). Blood 
glucose should be maintained at <l80 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia. There is no established role for the administration of glucose-insulin-potassium infusions in NSTE-ACS.
609–611
Although patients with diabetes mellitus and NSTE-ACS 
are at higher risk for in-hospital and longer-term events, they 
undergo less frequent revascularization procedures. In a mul-
tinational study of 6385 patients with ACS, 25% of whom had diabetes mellitus, those with diabetes mellitus had more adverse risk profiles, more atypical presentations, longer treat-ment delays, more HF, and renal insufficiency but underwent less angiography and revascularization.
607 In the GRACE 
Registry593 and other studies,606 patients with diabetes melli-
tus and NSTE-ACS in the United Kingdom603 and Finland612 
had higher baseline risk profiles but received effective medical cardiac therapies and revascularization less frequently.

Although there are no RCTs of patients specifically diagnosed 
with diabetes mellitus and ACS, there are ample data on patients 
with diabetes mellitus treated with PCI or CABG.564,565,613–615 
The largest RCT, the FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trial,
616 evaluated 1900 
patients (approximately 30% with “recent” [interval unspecified] 
ACS) with 2- or 3-vessel CAD randomized to a DES or CABG. 
At 5 years, there was a significant decrease in all-cause mortality 
(P=0.049; MI: P <0.001) associated with CABG. There was no 
specific analysis of outcomes in patients with “recent” (interval 
unspecified) ACS. CABG was also superior to PCI in reducing MACE in other trials
564,613–615 (Appendix 4, Table D).
The importance of the severity and complexity of CAD was 
underscored in the SYNTAX trial, in which those with less severe and complex CAD had similar outcomes with PCI and CABG 
compared with those with more severe and complex disease, in 
which CABG improved outcomes, including survival.
355,565
7.3.1. Adjunctive TherapyA meta-analysis (6 trials: 23 072 patients without diabetes mel-
litus, 6458 patients with diabetes mellitus) of the effect of GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban) on mortality in NSTEMI revealed that for the 
entire patient group, a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor was associated with 
reduced 30-day mortality (6.2% to 4.6%; P =0.007).
392 This 
benefit was particularly large in the 1279 patients with dia-
betes mellitus who underwent PCI (4.0% to 1.2%; P=0.002). 
The ACUITY trial in ACS (13 819 patients, 3852 with diabe-
tes mellitus) reported that 30-day adverse clinical outcomes 
(death, MI, or unplanned revascularization) or major bleeding were increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (12.9% ver -
sus 10.6%; P<0.001).
617 Bivalirudin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor 
resulted in increased similar rates of the composite ischemia compared with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Bivalirudin 
alone was associated with a similar increased rate of composite 
ischemia but less major bleeding (3.7% versus 7.1%; P <0.001).
Several studies evaluated the benefit of oral antiplatelet ther -
apy during ACS in patients with diabetes mellitus. In TRITON-TIMI 38, patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater reduction 
in ischemic events without an observed increase in TIMI major 
bleeding with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel.
618 In 
PLATO, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel reduced isch-
emic events irrespective of diabetic status and glycemic con-
trol, without an increase in major bleeding.619
See Online Data Supplement 27 for additional information 
on diabetes mellitus.
7.4. Post–CABG: Recommendation
Class I
1. Patients with prior CABG and NSTE-ACS should 
receive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy ac-cording to GDMT and should be strongly considered for early invasive strategy because of their increased 
risk.
67,68,141,340–342 (Level of Evidence: B)
Although CABG reduces morbidity and mortality in selected 
patients with complex CAD, they remain at risk for develop-ment of disease progression of ungrafted native vessels or significant atherothrombotic disease in saphenous vein grafts 
and subsequent ACS. These patients constitute a higher-risk 
group because they have already undergone CABG, typically for 
more extensive CAD, and they have more comorbidities.
620–624
In the PURSUIT trial, 12%1,134 of the patients had prior 
CABG and more adverse follow-up outcomes, including 
increased mortality, but had a benefit with eptifibatide similar 
to those without prior CABG.622 Patients with prior CABG are 
less likely to undergo early catheterization after NSTEMI. In 
the Get With The Guidelines study of patients with NSTEMI, 
18.5% had prior CABG and a lower likelihood of early inva-
sive evaluation but had higher rates of guideline-recommended 
clopidogrel and bivalirudin therapy and lower rates of GP IIb/IIIa and anticoagulant therapy.
625 In patients with prior CABG 
who develop NSTE-ACS that is related to an ungrafted native 
coronary vessel, treatment should follow GDMT.26
Because patients with prior CABG presenting with ACS 
are a high-risk group with increased comorbid characteris-tics and high-risk anatomy, a strategy of early angiography 
should be implemented (unless clinically contraindicated), 
and these patients should receive optimal antiplatelet and 
anticoagulant therapy.
See Online Data Supplement 28 for additional information 
on post-CABG.
7.5. Perioperative NSTE-ACS Related to 
Noncardiac Surgery: Recommendations
Class I
1. Patients who develop NSTE-ACS following noncar -
diac surgery should receive GDMT as recommended 
for patients in the general population but with the 
modifications imposed by the specific noncardiac 
surgical procedure and the severity of the NSTE-
ACS.626,627 (Level of Evidence: C)
2. In patients who develop NSTE-ACS after noncardiac 
surgery, management should be directed at the un-
derlying cause.21,626–634 (Level of Evidence: C)
Patients with NSTE-ACS following noncardiac surgery should 
be managed according to the guidelines for patients in the gen-
eral population, with risk stratification and guideline-based phar -
macological and invasive management directed at the etiology  
(eg, hypertension, tachycardia, HF, hypotension, sepsis, and ane-mia) with modifications based on the severity of NSTE-ACS and 
the limitations imposed by the noncardiac surgical procedure.
The definition of ACS has a substantial effect on reported 
incidence.
178,184,635–644 Some patients may not be able to give a 
history of ischemic symptoms because of the noncardiac sur -
gery. The criteria in the 2012 Third Universal Definition of MI should be applied.
21 In patients at risk of ACS following non-
cardiac surgery, routine monitoring of troponins and ECGs may 
be performed. As the sensitivity of troponin assays improves, 
the frequency of identifying perioperative MI will increase. In 
the POISE (Perioperative Ischemic Study Evaluation) trial,645 
of 8351 patients randomized to extended-release metoprolol versus placebo, 5.7% of patients in the control group had a 
perioperative MI typically occurring within 48 hours and often 
not associated with ischemic symptoms.

ACS in the setting of noncardiac surgery is associated with 
increased mortality. Several risk scores have been developed 
to determine the probability of mortality.646–648 A meta-analysis 
of the prognostic value of troponin and CK-MB after noncar -
diac surgery that included 14 studies enrolling 3318 patients demonstrated that elevated troponin after surgery was an independent predictor of mortality both in the hospital and at 
1-year follow-up.
639 Markedly elevated troponins are associ-
ated with increased mortality compared with minimal troponin 
elevation, even though the latter still indicates a postoperative MI.
184,639,641,642 In patients with UA in whom the risks of bleed-
ing with antiplatelet therapy outweigh the benefits, GDMT with beta blockers, nitrates, and ACE inhibitors should be 
optimized to achieve symptom control. In patients with a rela-
tive or absolute contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagu-lant therapy, coronary angiography may be helpful to identify anatomy requiring revascularization after recovery from the noncardiac surgery.
7.6. CKD: Recommendations
Class I
1. CrCl should be estimated in patients with NSTE-
ACS, and doses of renally cleared medications should 
be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic data 
for specific medications.649,650 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Patients undergoing coronary and LV angiogra-
phy should receive adequate hydration. (Level of 
 Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. An invasive strategy is reasonable in patients with mild (stage 2) and moderate (stage 3) CKD.
649–652 
(Level of Evidence: B)
CKD is a major risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with 
NSTEMI.652–657 Patients with impaired renal function have 
additional adverse baseline characteristics, including older 
age, a history of prior HF, and peripheral arterial disease. It 
is prudent to omit LV angiography in patients with CKD and assess LV function with echocardiography.
In an analysis from 3 ACS trial databases of 19 304 patients 
with NSTEMI, 42% (8152 patients) had abnormal renal func-tion on the basis of serum creatinine and calculated CrCl; total mortality and mortality/MI were increased at 30 days and 
180 days. CrCl was independently associated with mortality 
(HR: 0.81) and the risk of mortality/MI (HR: 0.93).
656 The 
V ALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial included 14 527 high-risk patients with AMI with LV dysfunc-
tion or HF and a serum creatinine level ≥1.5 mg/dL.
658,659 The 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation was used, and patients were analyzed based on their estimated GFR. There 
was an increasing adjusted HR for both death and the compos-
ite endpoint of cardiovascular death, reinfarction, HF, stroke, or resuscitation after cardiac arrest with decreasing estimated GFR. For death, with a GFR <45.0 mL per minute/1.73 m
2, 
the adjusted HR was 1.70 compared with patients with a GFR of 60.0 mL per minute/1.73 m
2 to 74.9 mL per minute/1.73 m2  in whom the adjusted HR was 1.14. There are insufficient data 
on the benefit-to-risk ratio of an invasive strategy in patients with NSTE-ACS and advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5).
652 There 
is also less evidence-based medical therapy and revasculariza-tion data in patients with CKD because of the risk for con-trast-induced nephropathy, increased need for dialysis, and increased mortality. Multiple studies have evaluated radio-graphic agents, including ionic versus nonionic media and 
isosmolar or low-osmolar agents.
The strength and consistency of relationships between spe-
cific isosmolar or low-osmolar agents and contrast-induced 
nephropathy or renal failure are insufficient for selection of low-osmolar and isosmolar media. Limitation of the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is based on reduced contrast volume
660 and adequate hydration.661
A recent meta-analysis of 5 RCTs evaluated 1453 patients 
with NSTE-ACS and CKD, all with GFR <60 mL per min-ute/1.73 m
2.651 Patients were analyzed according to baseline 
renal function: stage 3a, 3b, and 4 to 5. An invasive strategy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality and the composite of death or nonfatal MI. An early 
invasive strategy in patients with CKD and ACS reduced 
rehospitalization and resulted in a trend toward lower mortal-ity and nonfatal reinfarction. The increased risk of mortality associated with mild, moderate, and severe CKD is evident across studies, and risks are increased as the gradient of renal dysfunction worsens.
649–651,662
See Online Data Supplement 29 for additional information 
on CKD.
7.6.1. Antiplatelet Therapy
Patients with CKD with ACS are at increased risk for isch-emic complications, including stent thrombosis and post–PCI ischemic events.
663 They are also predisposed to higher 
bleeding complications, which, in addition to the lack of clinical trial data, result in their undertreatment with anti-platelet therapy. Patients with advanced CKD exhibit high 
residual platelet reactivity despite treatment with clopi-
dogrel independent of the presence of diabetes mellitus.
664 
Hyporesponsiveness to thienopyridines is associated with increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including car -
diovascular mortality,
665 and higher dosing regimens of 
clopidogrel do not appear to further suppress adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation.
664,666
Although prasugrel may be more efficient than doubling 
the dose of clopidogrel in achieving adequate platelet inhi-bition,
667 no clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy 
in patients with CKD with ACS. Ticagrelor, however, was 
studied in a prespecified analysis from the PLATO trial.668 In 
patients with an estimated GFR <60 mL per minute (nearly 
21% of patients in PLATO with available central laboratory serum creatinine levels), ticagrelor significantly reduced the primary cardiovascular endpoint (17.3% versus 22.0%; 
HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.90) compared with clopido-
grel.
667 Notably, this was associated with a 4% absolute risk 
reduction in all-cause mortality favoring ticagrelor and with no differences in major bleeding, fatal bleeding, and non–CABG-related major bleeding events, demonstrating its util-ity in patients with renal insufficiency.

7.7. Women: Recommendations
Class I
1. Women with NSTE-ACS should be managed with the 
same pharmacological therapy as that for men for 
acute care and for secondary prevention, with atten-
tion to weight and/or renally calculated doses of anti-platelet and anticoagulant agents to reduce bleeding risk.
669–673 (Level of Evidence: B)
2. Women with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features (eg, 
troponin positive) should undergo an early invasive 
strategy.141,345,346,561 (Level of Evidence: A)
Class IIa
1. Myocardial revascularization is reasonable in preg-nant women with NSTE-ACS if an ischemia-guided  
strategy is ineffective for management of life-threatening complications.
674 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class III: No Benefit
1. Women with NSTE-ACS and low-risk features (see Section 3.3.1) should not undergo early invasive treatment because of the lack of benefit
141,345,346 and 
the possibility of harm.141 (Level of Evidence: B)
Women of all ages have higher rates of in-hospital and long-
term complications of NSTE-ACS than men, including bleed-ing, HF, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, recurrent MI, stroke, and readmissions.
670,675,676
Women present later after symptom onset of NSTE-ACS 
and have higher rates of inappropriate discharges from the ED.
671,677,678 Women more commonly report atypical symp-
toms than men.675,679 Women presenting with chest pain are 
more likely than men to have either a noncardiac cause or cardiac causes other than obstructive epicardial coronary dis-ease.
108,677,680,681 Women with NSTE-ACS with no apparent 
obstructive epicardial disease have a 2% risk of death or MI within 30 days and require secondary prevention and symp-tom management.
682
Women derive the same treatment benefit as men from aspi-
rin, clopidogrel, anticoagulants, beta blockers, ACE inhibi-tors, and statins.
385,670–672,675,676,683,684 Despite worse outcomes, 
women with NSTE-ACS are underprescribed guideline-directed pharmacological therapy, both during the acute ill-ness and at discharge.
538,685,686 The basis for pharmacotherapy 
for women with NSTE-ACS with abnormal biomarkers and/or functional tests, but without significant obstructive epicar -
dial disease, remains unclear (Section 7.13). In addition to risk factor modification, some studies support the benefit of 
imipramine, ranolazine, beta blockers, and/or ACE inhibitors 
to reduce adverse outcomes.
687 Women with NSTE-ACS incur 
a higher rate of bleeding complications672,673 (Section 7.8) and 
renal failure. A risk score has been developed to attempt to reduce the bleeding risk in women with NSTE-ACS.
688
The decision for an early invasive versus an ischemia-guided 
strategy in women with NSTE-ACS is based on a meta-analysis366 
and post hoc gender analyses of clinical trials, including FRISC 
II, RITA-3, and TACTICS-TIMI 18.344,346,689 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality analysis of an early invasive 
versus ischemia-guided strategy345 provides further evidence 
that an early invasive strategy should be reserved for women 
with positive troponins, as shown in TACTICS-TIMI 18.346 
Such women had a significant reduction of death and MI at 
1 year with an early invasive versus ischemia-guided strategy. Women with NSTE-ACS and no elevation in troponin who 
underwent an early invasive strategy had a nonsignificant 
increase in events, as did women with a low-risk TIMI score (OR: 1.59 for early invasive versus ischemia-guided strategy), prompting the Class III recommendation in this CPG.
The NCDR-ACTION registry reported increased com-
plication rates of myocardial revascularization in women (https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/action/). Women also have 
higher rates of contrast-induced nephropathy and vascular complications.
673,690,691 Despite having fewer high-risk angio-
graphic lesions, a higher percentage of normal LV function, 
and up to 25% angiographically normal coronary arteries, 
women with NSTE-ACS have a paradoxically higher rate of persistent angina, reinfarction, functional decline, and depression after PCI.
141,675,677,680,682 Clinical trials,692,693 and a 
meta-analysis694 of DES for NSTE-ACS reported no gender 
differences in short- and long-term (up to 5 years) outcome, including target vessel revascularization, MACE, cardiac 
death, or MI. However, women were older and had more 
comorbidities than men at enrollment.
Women with NSTE-ACS referred for CABG are older with 
more comorbidities, which is reflected by higher periproce-dural mortality, HF, bleeding, MI, and renal failure.
686,695,696 
Women required more periprocedural IABP, vasopressors, 
mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and blood products and had 
longer stays in the intensive care unit and hospital, higher rates of wound infection, depression, and longer recovery.
549,677
An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality metaanal-
ysis of 10 RCTs through December 2011 reported no efficacy or safety difference between PCI and CABG for NSTE-ACS in 
men or women in 30-day or 1-year MACE (death/MI/stroke). 
At 2 years, the procedural success remained equal in women but favored CABG in men (P=0.002).
345,564 The Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality reported similar outcomes in women with diabetes mellitus with PCI and CABG for 
NSTE-ACS at 7 years, but men with diabetes mellitus had 
fewer events with CABG. A prespecified gender analysis of the FREEDOM trial favored CABG over PCI for women with diabetes mellitus, although the difference was not as signifi-cant as it was for men.
616
Consistent with the European Society of Cardiology recom-
mendations, myocardial revascularization should be reserved 
for pregnant women with NSTE-ACS and very serious com-
plications unresponsive to medical therapy.674
See Online Data Supplement 30 for more information on 
women.
7.8. Anemia, Bleeding, and Transfusion: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. All patients with NSTE-ACS should be evaluated for 
the risk of bleeding. (Level of Evidence: C)
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on November 12, 2025

e390  Circulation  December 23/30, 2014
2. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be 
weight-based where appropriate and should be ad-justed when necessary for CKD to decrease the risk of bleeding in patients with NSTE-ACS.
522,697,698 (Level 
of Evidence: B)
Class III: No Benefit
1. A strategy of routine blood transfusion in hemody-namically stable patients with NSTE-ACS and hemo-globin levels greater than 8 g/dL is not recommend-ed.
699–703 (Level of Evidence: B)
Anemia in patients with ACS is associated with an increased risk 
for Holter monitor–detected recurrent ischemia and for MACE, with greater anemia correlating with greater risk.
704–708 In 1 large 
analysis of multiple studies, the risk of adverse outcome was higher 
in patients with NSTE-ACS with hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL.704  
The potentially detrimental effects of severe anemia include 
decreased myocardial oxygen delivery and increased MVO2 
related to maintenance of a higher cardiac output.704,709,710 Patients 
with anemia are less likely to be treated with aspirin, and patients with ACS and anemia are likely to have more bleeding complica-tions with PCI.
711 This has been correlated with increased short-
term risk of MACE outcomes, including mortality; long-term risk remains controversial.
712–717 The ACUITY study suggests that the 
risk of mortality associated with bleeding is at least as great as that associated with procedure-related or spontaneous MI.
718 
Major bleeding is a coprimary endpoint in many trials 
and is a consideration when assessing the “net clinical ben-efit” of a new drug. A “universal definition of bleeding” has 
been proposed to assist clinicians.
547,719–721 The incidence of 
major bleeding in patients with ACS varies widely (0.4% to 
10%)715,722 owing to differing definitions of major bleeding, 
patient populations, anticoagulation regimens, and PCI or CABG. Factors in patients with ACS related to an increased bleeding risk include older age, female sex, lower body 
weight, history of prior bleeding and/or invasive procedures, 
anemia, use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors or thrombolytics, and CKD.
522,711,713–715,722,723 Non–weight-based dosing of anticoagu-
lants and dosing of antithrombin and antiplatelet medications that are not adjusted for CKD are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
522,697,698 Bleeding is related to adverse out-
comes because it may be a marker of underlying disease, such as occult malignancy; leads to cessation of antithrombin and antiplatelet therapy; may prompt transfusion, which itself may have adverse effects; can cause hypotension; and, if intracra-
nial, can be fatal.
724 Proton pump inhibitors decrease the risk 
of upper GI bleeding, including in patients treated with DAPT. 
Proton pump inhibitors are used in patients with a history of prior GI bleeding who require DAPT and are an option in 
patients at increased risk of GI bleeding.
26,430
Evaluation of the risk of bleeding includes a focused his-
tory of bleeding symptoms, identification of predisposing comorbidities, evaluation of laboratory data, and calculation 
of a bleeding risk score.
688,716,725 Approximately 15% of all 
patients with NSTE-ACS and 3% to 12% of those not under -
going CABG receive blood transfusion.702 Rates vary widely 
and are closer to the lower figure but increase in association 
with factors such as coronary intervention, anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy, older age, female sex, anemia, renal 
insufficiency, and frailty. Tissue oxygenation does not change 
or may actually decrease with transfusion.722 Blood transfu-
sion in patients with ACS is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome, including death.
702–704 A restrictive trans-
fusion strategy leads to an outcome that is at least as good, if 
not better, than a liberal transfusion strategy.699,700 An analysis 
of a large ACS registry found no benefit from blood transfu-sion in patients with a nadir hematocrit >24%.
702 In a meta-
analysis of 10 studies of patients with AMI, transfusion versus no transfusion was associated with an increase in all-cause 
mortality (18.2% versus 10.2%; P<0.001) and subsequent 
MI rate (RR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.93; P=0.03).
726 A restric-
tive approach to transfusion generally consists of no routine transfusion for a hemoglobin level >7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.
699,700,727 
A restrictive approach to blood transfusion is advocated by the American Association of Blood Banks
700 and the European 
Society of Cardiology.727 On the basis of data available at the 
time of publication, a strategy of routine liberal blood transfu-
sion in hemodynamically stable patients with NSTE-ACS and 
mild to moderate anemia is not recommended.
See Online Data Supplement 31 for more information on 
anemia, bleeding, and transfusion.
7.9. Thrombocytopenia
The incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with ACS var -
ies from 1% to 13%. In 1 large prospective registry, one third 
of patients treated with prolonged heparin therapy developed 
some degree of thrombocytopenia.728 Independent risk fac-
tors for the development of thrombocytopenia include lower 
baseline platelet count, older age, ACS, cardiac or vascular 
surgery, intravenous UFH or both UFH and LMWH, duration of heparin therapy, and low body mass index.
728–730 The risk of 
thrombocytopenia is increased in patients treated with abcix-
imab and, to a lesser degree, with eptifibatide or tirofiban.731–734
Thrombocytopenia on presentation or related to antithrom-
botic therapy is associated with significantly increased risk of thrombotic events, MI, major bleeding, and in-hospital mor -
tality in patients with and without ACS.
728–731,735–739 The OR for 
development of these endpoints with thrombocytopenia (com-pared to without thrombocytopenia) is 2 to 8. Data from the 
CATCH (Complications After Thrombocytopenia Caused by Heparin) registry identified a platelet count nadir of 125 × 109/L 
as a threshold, below which there is a linear augmentation in 
probability of bleeding.
740 Results from CATCH highlighted 
that thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytope-nia are often not diagnosed.
728 Thrombocytopenia is gener -
ally a contraindication for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy; direct thrombin inhibitors are often considered in preference to UFH or LMWH in patients with thrombocytopenia.
See Online Data Supplements 31 and 32 for additional 
information on anemia, bleeding, and transfusion.
7.10. Cocaine and Methamphetamine Users: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. Patients with NSTE-ACS and a recent history of 
cocaine or methamphetamine use should be treated 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on November 12, 2025

Amsterdam et al  2014 AHA/ACC NSTE-ACS Guideline  e391
in the same manner as patients without cocaine- or 
methamphetamine-related NSTE-ACS. The only ex-
ception is in patients with signs of acute intoxication 
(eg, euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension) and beta-blocker use, unless patients are receiving coro-nary vasodilator therapy. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with nitro-glycerin are reasonable for management of hyperten-sion and tachycardia in patients with NSTE-ACS and signs of acute cocaine or methamphetamine intoxica-tion.
741–744 (Level of Evidence: C)
Class III: Harm
1. Beta blockers should not be administered to patients with ACS with a recent history of cocaine or metham-
phetamine use who demonstrate signs of acute intoxi-
cation due to the risk of potentiating coronary spasm. (Level of Evidence: C)
Cocaine exerts multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, 
which may precipitate ACS.
48,744,745 Acute cocaine exposure 
results in increased BP, heart rate, endothelial dysfunction, 
and platelet aggregation, all of which may precipitate ACS. 
Cocaine’s direct vasoconstrictor effect can produce coronary vasospasm. Long-term use of cocaine results in progressive 
myocyte damage and accelerated atherosclerosis.
48,744,745
ACS in patients with a history of cocaine use should be 
treated in the same manner as patients without cocaine use.744 
The exception is in patients with ACS in the presence of acute cocaine intoxication. Because cocaine stimulates both alpha- 
and beta-adrenergic receptors, administration of intravenous beta blockers may result in unopposed alpha stimulation with 
worsening coronary spasm.
48,132,744–746 Evidence suggests it is 
safe to administer intravenous beta blockers in patients with chest pain and recent cocaine ingestion, although information 
is lacking about the effects of beta-blocker administration dur -
ing the acute stages of cocaine intoxication.
747,748 Intravenous 
beta blockers should be avoided in patients with NSTE-ACS 
with signs of acute cocaine intoxication (euphoria, tachycar -
dia, and/or hypertension). In these patients, benzodiazepines 
alone or in combination with nitroglycerin have been useful 
for management of hypertension and tachycardia owing to 
their effects on the central and peripheral manifestations of 
acute cocaine intoxication.741–744
Methamphetamine abuse is becoming increasingly com-
mon in the United States owing to the ease of manufactur -
ing and the lower cost of methamphetamines compared with 
cocaine.131,749,750 Methamphetamines may be ingested orally, 
inhaled, or used intravenously. Methamphetamine affects the central nervous system by simultaneously stimulating the release and blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepi-
nephrine.
751 Like cocaine, methamphetamine exerts multiple 
effects on the cardiovascular system, all of which may pre-cipitate ACS.
131,750–752 The acute effects of methamphetamine 
are euphoria, tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmias. MI may result from coronary spasm or plaque rupture in the presence of enhanced platelet aggregation. Long-term use 
of methamphetamine has been associated with myocardi-tis, necrotizing vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, and car -
diomyopathy.
750–752 Because methamphetamine and cocaine 
have similar pathophysiological effects, treatment of patients with ACS associated with methamphetamine and cocaine use should theoretically be similar.
See Online Data Supplement 33 for additional information 
about cocaine and methamphetamine users.
7.11. Vasospastic (Prinzmetal) Angina: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. CCBs alone753–757 or in combination with long-
acting nitrates755,758 are useful to treat and reduce 
the frequency of vasospastic angina. (Level of 
 Evidence: B)
2. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibi-tor,
759,760 cessation of tobacco use,761,762 and addition-
al atherosclerosis risk factor modification762,763 are 
useful in patients with vasospastic angina. (Level of  Evidence: B)
3. Coronary angiography (invasive or noninvasive) is recommended in patients with episodic chest pain ac-companied by transient ST-elevation to rule out se-
vere obstructive CAD. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIb
1. Provocative testing during invasive coronary angiog-
raphy†† may be considered in patients with suspect-ed vasospastic angina when clinical criteria and non-invasive testing fail to establish the diagnosis.
764–767 
(Level of Evidence: B)
Vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina chest pain typically occurs 
without provocation, is associated with ST-elevation, and usu-
ally resolves spontaneously or with rapid-acting nitroglycerin. 
Vasospastic angina may also be precipitated by emotional stress, hyperventilation, exercise, or the cold. It results from coronary vasomotor dysfunction leading to focal spasm,
768 
which may occasionally be multifocal within a single vessel and rarely involves >1 vessel. Vasospastic angina occurs with normal coronary arteries, nonobstructive CAD, and obstruc-
tive CAD, but prognosis is least favorable with the latter. 
ST-elevation indicates transmural ischemia and corresponds to the distribution of the involved artery.
769 A circadian varia-
tion is often present; most attacks occur in the early morn-ing.
770,771 The most prominent coronary risk factor is smoking. 
Most episodes resolve without complications, but arrhyth-mias, syncope, MI, and sudden death can occur.
772
††Provocative testing during invasive coronary angiography (eg, using 
ergonovine, acetylcholine, methylergonovine) is relatively safe, especially 
when performed in a controlled manner by experienced operators. However, sustained spasm, serious arrhythmias, and even death can also occur very infrequently. Therefore, provocative testing should be avoided in patients with significant left main disease, advanced 3-vessel disease, presence of high-grade obstructive lesions, significant valvular stenosis, significant LV systolic dysfunction, and advanced HF.

e392  Circulation  December 23/30, 2014
Nonpharmacological provocative tests, such as cold pressor 
and hyperventilation, have been used diagnostically; potent 
vasoconstrictors (eg, acetylcholine) may be useful when non-invasive assessment is uninformative.
764–767 Smoking, which 
exacerbates coronary vasospasm, should be proscribed, and 
CCBs are first-line therapies642; long-acting nitrates are also 
effective when combined with CCBs.755,758 Statins improve 
endothelium-dependent vasodilation and can be useful in vaso-spastic angina.
759,760 Magnesium supplementation and alpha-
receptor blockers may be effective and can be added.755,758
7.12. ACS With Angiographically Normal Coronary 
Arteries: Recommendation
Class IIb
1. If coronary angiography reveals normal coronary 
arteries and endothelial dysfunction is suspected, 
invasive physiological assessment such as coronary 
flow reserve measurement may be considered.629,773–776 
(Level of Evidence: B)
ACS associated with angiographically normal or nonob-
structive (<50% stenosis) coronary arteries (also referred to as syndrome X) may be related to coronary endothelial dysfunction
777; plaque rupture that may be evident only with 
intracoronary ultrasound778; coronary vasospasm779; and coro-
nary artery dissection.780 Myocarditis may present with elec-
trocardiographic and biomarker findings similar to ACS and 
can be distinguished by magnetic resonance imaging.781–783 
Intracoronary ultrasound and/or optical coherence tomog-
raphy to assess the extent of atherosclerosis and exclude obstructive lesions may be considered in patients with possi-
ble ACS and angiographically normal coronary arteries.
778 If 
ECGs during chest pain are not available and coronary spasm 
cannot be ruled out, coronary angiography and provocative 
testing with acetylcholine, adenosine, or methacholine and 
24-hour ambulatory ECG may be undertaken after a period of stabilization. Endothelial dysfunction is more common in women than in men,
679,777,784–786 and chest pain is typical 
or atypical.785,786 In the absence of a culprit coronary lesion, 
prognosis of coronary endothelial dysfunction and/or occult 
plaque rupture is favorable.765,787
Risk factor reduction and medical therapy with nitrates, 
beta blockers, and CCBs alone or in combination are consid-ered for endothelial dysfunction.
788–790 High doses of arginine 
have also been given.791 Imipramine or aminophylline have 
been used in patients with endothelial dysfunction for contin-
ued pain despite optimal medical therapy. In postmenopausal women, estrogen reverses acetylcholine-induced coronary 
arterial vasoconstriction, presumably by improving endothe-
lium-dependent coronary vasomotion, and reduces frequency 
of chest pain.
792 However, estrogen is not recommended 
because of its demonstrated increase in cardiovascular and 
other risks.793
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection affects a young, 
predominantly female population. Treatment of spontaneous 
coronary artery dissection with CABG or stenting is described to improve outcome,
794 but high rates of stenting complica-
tions are reported.7807.13. Stress (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy: 
Recommendations
Class I
1. Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy should be con-
sidered in patients who present with apparent ACS and nonobstructive CAD at angiography. (Level of Evidence: C)
2. Imaging with ventriculography, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to 
confirm or exclude the diagnosis of stress (Takotsubo) 
cardiomyopathy.
795–798 (Level of Evidence: B)
3. Patients should be treated with conventional agents 
(ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, aspirin, and diuret-
ics) as otherwise indicated if hemodynamically sta-
ble. (Level of Evidence: C)
4. Anticoagulation should be administered in patients 
who develop LV thrombi. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIa
1. It is reasonable to use catecholamines for patients with symptomatic hypotension if outflow tract ob-struction is not present. (Level of Evidence: C)
2. The use of IABP is reasonable for patients with re-fractory shock. (Level of Evidence: C)
3. It is reasonable to use beta blockers and alpha-
adrenergic agents in patients with outflow tract 
obstruction. (Level of Evidence: C)
Class IIb
1. Prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered to inhibit the development of LV thrombi. (Level of  Evidence: C)
Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (also referred to as tran-
sient LV apical ballooning or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) 
mimics NSTE or STEMI.
799–803 There is no obstructive CAD, 
and the distribution of electrocardiographic changes and LV 
wall motion abnormalities usually includes >1 coronary artery 
territory.801 Cardiac troponin elevations are usually modest.798 
The majority of cases occur in postmenopausal women, and 
presentation is typically precipitated by emotional or physi-
cal stress. Imaging by echocardiography, ventriculography,696 
or magnetic resonance imaging699 demonstrates characteristic 
hypokinesis or dyskinesis of the LV apex with basilar increased contractility. Variants include hypokinesis of the mid or base of 
the left ventricle,
795 and right ventricular involvement is com-
mon.804 In the vast majority of patients, electrocardiographic 
and LV wall motion abnormalities normalize within 1 to 4 
weeks, and recurrences are uncommon.805 The pathogenesis 
has been attributed to excess catecholamine release,803 coro-
nary spasm, or small coronary vessel hypoperfusion.806
Care is predominantly supportive and includes beta block-
ers, vasodilators, and catecholamines. The latter 2 interven-tions must be used cautiously, because they may induce 
outflow tract obstruction.
800 If shock is present, IABP can be 
used. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered to 
prevent or treat LV thrombus.798

7.14. Obesity
Obesity is associated with conditions such as dyslipidemia, 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, arrhythmias, and HF that 
adversely affect ACS outcomes. In the MADIT (Multicenter 
Automatic Defibrillator Implantation)-II trial, there was an inverse relation between body mass index and both all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death in patients with LV dys-
function after MI.
807 In the SYNERGY trial of 9837 patients 
with NSTEMI, mortality was lower in morbidly obese patients, consistent with the “obesity paradox.”
808 The “obe-
sity paradox” has not been clarified and is under continuing investigation. Standard approaches to weight reduction in 
obese patients are usually unsuccessful in producing large decreases in weight. A weight reduction study of obese and morbidly obese patients following AMI resulted in weight loss of only 0.5% in obese patients and 3.5% in morbidly 
obese patients after 1 year.
809 Two drugs, controlled-release 
phentermine/topiramate810 and lorcaserin,811 are available for 
weight reduction but have not been studied in patients fol-
lowing NSTE-ACS. Bariatric surgery has been successful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mel-litus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia but has not been evalu-
ated in post–ACS patients.
812 The 2013 obesity CPG provides 
comprehensive strategies for weight reduction.16
7.15. Patients Taking Antineoplastic/
Immunosuppressive Therapy
Antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy may contrib-
ute to the development of NSTE-ACS. For example, anti-
neoplastic agents such as gemcitabine, sorafenib sunitinib, 
and  5-fluorouracil have been associated with coronary artery 
spasm or stenosis.813,814 Trastuzumab and possibly other anti-
cancer drugs may alter biomarker levels.815 Antineoplastic 
agents can induce changes in the arterial wall,813 and modula-
tors of inflammation may promote atherogenesis.816 In patients 
receiving these agents, it is prudent to communicate with the 
prescribing clinician about the necessity of their continuation 
during NSTE-ACS and future resumption.
8. Quality of Care and Outcomes for ACS–Use 
of Performance Measures and Registries
8.1. Use of Performance Measures and Registries: 
Recommendation
Class IIa
1. Participation in a standardized quality-of-care data 
registry designed to track and measure outcomes, 
complications, and performance measures can be 
beneficial in improving the quality of NSTE-ACS 
care.817–825 (Level of Evidence: B)
The development of national systems for ACS is crucial and 
includes the participation of key stakeholders to evaluate care 
using standardized performance and quality-improvement 
measures for ACS.819,821 Standardized quality-of-care data reg-
istries include the NCDR Registry–Get With the Guidelines, the Get With the Guidelines quality-improvement program, 
the Acute Myocardial Infarction Core Measure Set, and performance measures required by The Joint Commission 
and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
817,823–825 
The AHA has promoted its Mission: Lifeline initiative to encourage cooperation among prehospital emergency medi-cal services personnel and cardiac care professionals.
817 The 
evaluation of ACS care delivery across traditional boundar -
ies can identify problems with systems and enable application of modern quality-improvement methods.
818,820,822 On a local 
level, registries as part of the Chronic Care Model were asso-
ciated with improved outcomes in chronic diseases, including 
cardiovascular disease.826,827
9. Summary and Evidence Gaps
Despite landmark advances in the care of patients with NSTE-ACS since the publication of the 2007 UA/NSTEMI CPG,
212 
many emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have 
posed new challenges. There is general acceptance of an early 
invasive strategy for patients with NSTE-ACS in whom sig-nificant coronary vascular obstruction has been precisely 
quantified. Low-risk patients with NSTE-ACS are documented 
to benefit substantially from GDMT, but this is often subopti-mally used. Advances in noninvasive testing have the potential to identify patients with NSTE-ACS who are at intermediate risk and are candidates for invasive versus medical therapy.
Newer, more potent antiplatelet agents in addition to antico-
agulant therapy are indicated irrespective of initial treatment strategy. Evidence-based decisions will require compara-tive-effectiveness studies of available and novel agents. The 
paradox of newer and more potent antithrombotic and anti-
coagulant drugs that reduce major adverse cardiac outcomes but increase bleeding risk occurs with greater frequency in patients with AF. Patients with AF who develop NSTE-ACS 
and receive a coronary stent are the population at risk from 
triple anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy. This regimen has been reported to be safely modified by elimination of aspirin, 
a finding that requires confirmation.
Among the most rapidly evolving areas in NSTE-ACS 
diagnosis is the use of cardiac troponin, the preferred bio-
marker of myocardial necrosis. Although a truly high-sensi-
tivity cardiac troponin is not available in the United States at 
the time this CPG was prepared, the sensitivity of contempo-rary assays continues to increase. This change is accompa-nied by higher rates of elevated cardiac troponin unrelated to coronary plaque rupture. The diagnostic quandary posed by these findings necessitates investigation to elucidate the opti-
mal utility of this advanced biomarker. A promising approach 
to improve the diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial necrosis is measurement of absolute cardiac troponin change, 
which may be more accurate than the traditional analysis of 
relative alterations.
Special populations are addressed in this CPG, the most 
numerous of which are older persons and women. More than half of the mortality in NSTE-ACS occurs in older patients, and this high-risk cohort will increase as our population ages. An unmet need is to more clearly distinguish which older patients are candidates for an ischemia-guided strategy compared with 
an early invasive management strategy. An appreciable number 
of patients with NSTE-ACS have angiographically normal or nonobstructive CAD, a group in which women predominate.

Their prognosis is not benign, and the multiple mechanisms of 
ACS postulated for these patients remain largely speculative. Clinical advances are predicated on clarification of the patho-physiology of this challenging syndrome.
A fundamental aspect of all CPGs is that these carefully 
developed, evidence-based documents cannot encompass all clinical circumstances, nor can they replace the judgment of 
individual physicians in management of each patient. The sci-
ence of medicine is rooted in evidence, and the art of medicine 
is based on the application of this evidence to the individual 
patient. This CPG has adhered to these principles for optimal 
management of patients with NSTE-ACS.

This table represents the relationships of committee members with industry and other entities that were determined to be relevant to this document. These 
relationships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and/or conference calls of the GWC during the document development process. The table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant interest in a business if the interest represents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$10 000 of the fair market value of the business entity; or if funds received by 
the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted.
According to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject matter, intellectual property 
or asset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a drug, drug class, or device addressed in the document, or makes a competing drug or device addressed in the document; ore) the person or a member of the person’s household, has a reasonable potential for financial, professional or other personal gain or loss as a result of the issues/content addressed in the document.

Appendix 4.  Additional Tables
Table A.  Universal Classification of MI
Type 1: Spontaneous MI
Spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in ≥1 of the coronary 
arteries leading to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte necrosis. The patient may have underlying severe CAD, but on 
occasion nonobstructive or no CAD.
Type 2: MI secondary to ischemic imbalance
In instances of myocardial injury with necrosis where a condition other than CAD contributes to an imbalance between MVO2, eg, coronary endothelial dysfunction, 
coronary artery spasm, coronary embolism, tachy-/bradyarrhythmias, anemia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypertension with or without LVH.
Type 3: MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable
Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic electrocardiographic changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before 
blood samples could be obtained, before cardiac biomarker could rise, or in rare cases where blood was not collected for cardiac biomarker testing.
Type 4a: MI related to PCI
MI associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values >5 × 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values (<99th percentile URL) or a 
rise of cTn values >20% if baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, (ii) new ischemic electrocardiographic changes or new LBBB, (iii) angiographic loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch or persistent slow or no flow or embolization, or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality is required.
Type 4b: MI related to stent thrombosisMI associated with stent thrombosis is detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac 
biomarker values with ≥1 value above the 99th percentile URL.
Type 5: MI related to CABGMI associated with CABG is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values >10 × 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values (<99th 
percentile URL). In addition, either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographically documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality.
CABG indicates coronary artery bypass graft; CAD, coronary artery disease; cTn, cardiac troponin; LBBB, left bundle-branch block; LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy; 
MI, myocardial infarction; MVO
2, myocardial oxygen consumption; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; and URL, upper reference limit.
