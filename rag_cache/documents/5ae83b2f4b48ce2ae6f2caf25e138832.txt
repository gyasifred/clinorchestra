Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 5STATEMENT OF INTENT
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guidelines are not intended to be con-
strued or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of medical care are determined onthe basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as sci-entific knowledge and technology advance and practice patterns evolve. These parameters ofpractice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successfuloutcome for every individual, nor should they be interpreted as including all proper methodsof care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimatejudgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the psy-chiatrist in light of the clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatmentoptions available.
This practice guideline has been developed by psychiatrists who are in active clinical prac-
tice. In addition, some contributors are primarily involved in research or other academicendeavors. It is possible that through such activities some contributors, including work groupmembers and reviewers, have received income related to treatments discussed in this guide-line. A number of mechanisms are in place to minimize the potential for producing biasedrecommendations due to conflicts of interest. Work group members are selected on the basisof their expertise and integrity. Any work group member or reviewer who has a potential con-flict of interest that may bias (or appear to bias) his or her work is asked to disclose this to theSteering Committee on Practice Guidelines and the work group. Iterative guideline drafts arereviewed by the Steering Committee, other experts, allied organizations, APA members, andthe APA Assembly and Board of Trustees; substantial revisions address or integrate the com-ments of these multiple reviewers. The development of the APA practice guidelines is notfinancially supported by any commercial organization.
More detail about mechanisms in place to minimize bias is provided in a document avail-
able from the APA Department of Quality Improvement and Psychiatric Services, “APAGuideline Development Process.”
This practice guideline was approved in December 2003 and published in February 2004.

6 APA Practice GuidelinesGUIDE TO USING THIS PRACTICE GUIDELINE
The Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia, Second Edition , consists
of three parts (Parts A, B, and C) and many sections, not all of which will be equally useful for
all readers. The following guide is designed to help readers find the sections that will be mostuseful to them.
Part A, “T reatment Recommendations for Patients With Schizophrenia,” is published as a
supplement to the American Journal of Psychiatry  and contains general and specific treatment
recommendations. Section I summarizes the key recommendations of the guideline and codeseach recommendation according to the degree of clinical confidence with which the recom-mendation is made. Section II is a guide to the formulation and implementation of a treatmentplan for the individual patient. Section II.F , “Clinical Features Influencing the Treatment Plan,”discusses a range of clinical considerations that could alter the general recommendations dis-cussed in Section II. Section III describes treatment settings and housing options and providesguidance on choice of setting.
Part B, “Background Information and Review of Available Evidence,” and Part C, “Future
Research Directions,” are not included in the American Journal of Psychiatry  supplement but
are provided with Part A in the complete guideline, which is available in print format fromAmerican Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., and online through the American Psychiatric Associa-tion (http://www.psych.org). Part B provides an overview of schizophrenia, including generalinformation on its natural history, course, and epidemiology. It also provides a structured re-view and synthesis of the evidence that underlies the recommendations made in Part A. Part Cdraws from the previous sections and summarizes areas for which more research data are neededto guide clinical decisions.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 7DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
This practice guideline was developed under the auspices of the Steering Committee on Prac-
tice Guidelines. The development process is detailed in a document available from the APADepartment of Quality Improvement and Psychiatric Services: the “APA Guideline Develop-ment Process.” Key features of this process include the following:
 A comprehensive literature review. Development of evidence tables. Initial drafting of the guideline by a work group that included psychiatrists with clinical
and research expertise in schizophrenia.
 Production of multiple revised drafts with widespread review; four organizations and 62
individuals submitted significant comments.
 Approval by the APA Assembly and Board of T rustees. Planned revisions at regular intervals.
Relevant literature was identified through a computerized search of PubMed for the period
from 1994 to 2002. Using the keywords schizophrenia OR schizoaffective, a total of 20,009
citations were found. Limiting the search by using the ke words antipsychotic agents, antipsy-chotic, tranquilizing agents, aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, risperidone,clozapine, glycine, beta receptor blockers, antidepressive agents, antidepressant, divalproex,valproic acid, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, electroconvulsive therapy, communitytreatment, psychoeducation, family education, skills training, social support, rehabilitation,case management, community support, supported employment, sheltered workshop, familytherapy, family intervention, psychosocial adjustment, cognitive behavior, cognitive training,cognitive therapy, counseling, psychotherapy, group therapy, interpersonal therapy, individualtherapy, first break, first episode, new onset, early treatment, and early detection resulted in8,609 citations. After limiting these references to clinical trials and meta-analyses published inEnglish that included abstracts, 1,272 articles were screened by using title and abstract infor-mation. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was also searched by using the keywordschizophrenia. Additional, less formal literature searches were conducted by APA staff and indi-vidual members of the work group on schizophrenia. Sources of funding were considered whenthe work group reviewed the literature but are not identified in this document. When readingsource articles referenced in this guideline, readers are advised to consider the sources of fund-ing for the studies.
This document represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and rational clinical
practice on the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. It strives to be as free as possible ofbias toward any theoretical approach to treatment. In order for the reader to appreciate the ev-idence base behind the guideline recommendations and the weight that should be given to eachrecommendation, the summary of treatment recommendations is keyed according to the levelof confidence with which each recommendation is made. Each rating of clinical confidenceconsiders the strength of the available evidence and is based on the best available data. Whenevidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensus with regard toa particular clinical decision. In the listing of cited references, each reference is followed by aletter code in brackets that indicates the nature of the supporting evidence.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 9PART A:
TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
/L50776 A. CODING SYSTEM
Each recommendation is identified as falling into one of three categories of endorsement, in-
dicated by a bracketed Roman numeral following the statement. The three categories representvarying levels of clinical confidence regarding the recommendation:
[I] Recommended with substantial clinical confidence.[II] Recommended with moderate clinical confidence.[III] May be recommended on the basis of individual circumstances.
/L50776 B. FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A TREATMENT PLAN
Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness that influences virtually all aspects of life of affectedpersons, treatment planning has three goals: 1) reduce or eliminate symptoms, 2) maximizequality of life and adaptive functioning, and 3) promote and maintain recovery from the de-bilitating effects of illness to the maximum extent possible. Accurate diagnosis has enormousimplications for short- and long-term treatment planning, and it is essential to note that diag-nosis is a process rather than a one-time event. As new information becomes available aboutthe patient and his or her symptoms, the patient’s diagnosis should be reevaluated, and, if nec-essary, the treatment plan changed.
Once a diagnosis has been established, it is critical to identify the targets of each treatment,
to have outcome measures that gauge the effect of treatment, and to have realistic expectationsabout the degrees of improvement that constitute successful treatment [I]. Targets of treatment,and hence of assessment, may include positive and negative symptoms, depression, suicidal ide-ation and behaviors, substance use disorders, medical comorbidities, posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD), and a range of potential community adjustment problems, including homelessness,social isolation, unemployment, victimization, and involvement in the criminal justice system[I].
After the initial assessment of the patient’s diagnosis and clinical and psychosocial circum-
stances, a treatment plan must be formulated and implemented. This formulation involves theselection of the treatment modalities, the specific type(s) of treatment, and the treatment set-ting. Periodic reevaluation of the diagnosis and the treatment plan is essential to good clinicalpractice and should be iterative and evolve over the course of the patient’s association with theclinician [I].

10 APA Practice Guidelines/L50776 C. ESTABLISHING A THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE
A supportive therapeutic alliance allows the psychiatrist to gain essential information about the
patient and allows the patient to develop trust in the psychiatrist and a desire to cooperate withtreatment. Identifying the patient’s goals and aspirations and relating these to treatment outcomesfosters the therapeutic relationship as well as treatment adherence [II]. The clinician may alsoidentify practical barriers to the patient’s ability to participate in treatment, such as cognitiveimpairments or disorganization and inadequate social resources. Engagement of the family andother significant support persons, with the patient’s permission, is recommended to furtherstrengthen the therapeutic effort [I]. The social circumstances of the patient can have profoundeffects on adherence and response to treatment. Living situation, family involvement, sources andamount of income, legal status, and relationships with significant others (including children)are all areas that may be periodically explored by mental health care clinicians [II]. The psychi-atrist can work with team members, the patient, and the family to ensure that such services arecoordinated and that referrals for additional services are made when appropriate. The family’sneeds can be addressed and an alliance with family members can be facilitated by providingfamilies with information about community resources and about patient and family organiza-tions such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) [II].
Many patients with schizophrenia require, and should receive, a variety of treatments, often
from multiple clinicians. It is therefore incumbent on clinicians to coordinate their work andprioritize their efforts. Because an accurate history of past and current treatments and responsesto them is a key ingredient to treatment planning, excellent documentation is paramount [I].Especially critical, for example, is information about prior treatment efforts and clinical re-sponse.
/L50776 D. ACUTE PHASE TREATMENT
The goals of treatment during the acute phase of treatment, defined by an acute psychoticepisode, are to prevent harm, control disturbed behavior, reduce the severity of psychosis andassociated symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression, negative symptoms, affective symptoms), de-termine and address the factors that led to the occurrence of the acute episode, effect a rapidreturn to the best level of functioning, develop an alliance with the patient and family, formu-late short- and long-term treatment plans, and connect the patient with appropriate aftercarein the community. Efforts to engage and collaborate with family members and other naturalcaregivers are often successful during the crisis of an acute psychotic episode, whether it is thefirst episode or a relapse, and are strongly recommended [I]. Family members are often undersignificant stress during this time. Also, family members and other caregivers are often neededto provide support to the patient while he or she is recovering from an acute episode.
It is recommended that every patient have as thorough an initial evaluation as his or her clin-
ical status allows, including complete psychiatric and general medical histories and physical andmental status examinations [I]. Interviews of family members or other persons knowledgeableabout the patient may be conducted routinely, unless the patient refuses to grant permission, es-pecially since many patients are unable to provide a reliable history at the first interview [I]. Themost common contributors to symptom relapse are antipsychotic medication nonadherence,substance use, and stressful life events, although relapses are not uncommon as a result of the nat-ural course of the illness despite continuing treatment. If nonadherence is suspected, it is recom-mended that the reasons for it be evaluated and considered in the treatment plan. Generalmedical health as well as medical conditions that could contribute to symptom exacerbation canbe evaluated by medical history, physical and neurological examination, and appropriate labora-tory, electrophysiological, and radiological assessments [I]. Measurement of body weight and vi-tal signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature) is also recommended [II]. Other laboratory

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 11tests to be considered to evaluate health status include a CBC; measurements of blood electro-
lytes, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides; tests of liver, renal, and thyroid function; a syphilistest; and when indicated and permissible, determination of HIV status and a test for hepatitis C[II]. Routine evaluation of substance use with a toxicology screen is also recommended as partof the medical evaluation [I]. A pregnancy test should be strongly considered for women withchildbearing potential [II]. In patients for whom the clinical picture is unclear or where there areabnormal findings from a routine examination, more detailed studies (e.g., screening for heavymetal toxins, EEG, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan, or computed tomography [CT] scan)may be indicated [II].
It is important to pay special attention to the presence of suicidal potential and the presence
of command hallucinations and take precautions whenever there is any question about a pa-tient’s suicidal intent, since prior suicide attempts, current depressed mood, and suicidal ide-ation can be predictive of a subsequent suicide attempt in schizophrenia [I]. Similar evaluationsare recommended in considering the likelihood of dangerous or aggressive behavior and wheth-er the person will harm someone else or engage in other forms of violence [I].
It is recommended that pharmacological treatment be initiated promptly, provided it will
not interfere with diagnostic assessment, because acute psychotic exacerbations are associatedwith emotional distress, disruption to the patient’s life, and a substantial risk of dangerous be-haviors to self, others, or property [I]. Before the patient begins treatment with antipsychoticmedication, it is suggested that the treating physician, as is feasible, discuss the potential risksand benefits of the medication with the patient [I]. The selection of an antipsychotic medica-tion is frequently guided by the patient’s previous experience with antipsychotics, including thedegree of symptom response, past experience of side effects, and preferred route of medicationadministration. In choosing among these medications, the psychiatrist may consider the pa-tient’s past responses to treatment, the medication’s side effect profile (including subjective re-sponses, such as a dysphoric response to a medication), the patient’s preferences for a particularmedication based on past experience, the intended route of administration, the presence of co-morbid medical conditions, and potential interactions with other prescribed medications [I].Finally, while most patients prefer oral medication, patients with recurrent relapses related tononadherence are candidates for a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication, as are pa-tients who prefer this mode of administration [II].
The recommended dose is that which is both effective and not likely to cause side effects
that are subjectively difficult to tolerate, since the experience of unpleasant side effects may af-fect long-term adherence [I]. The dose may be titrated as quickly as tolerated to the target ther-apeutic dose of the antipsychotic medication, and unless there is evidence that the patient ishaving uncomfortable side effects, monitoring of the patient’s clinical status for 2–4 weeks iswarranted to evaluate the patient’s response to the treatment [II]. During these weeks it is oftenimportant for physicians to be patient and avoid the temptation to prematurely escalate thedose for patients who are responding slowly [I]. If the patient is not improving, it may be help-ful to establish whether the lack of response can be explained by medication nonadherence,rapid medication metabolism, or poor absorption [II].
Adjunctive medications are also commonly prescribed for comorbid conditions in the acute
phase. Benzodiazepines may be used to treat catatonia as well as to manage both anxiety andagitation until the antipsychotic has had time to be therapeutically effective [II]. Antidepres-sants can be considered for treating comorbid major depression or obsessive-compulsive disor-der, although vigilance to protect against the risk of exacerbation of psychosis with someantidepressants is important [II]. Mood stabilizers and beta-blockers may be considered for re-ducing the severity of recurrent hostility and aggression [II]. Careful attention must be paid topotential drug-drug interactions, especially those related to metabolism by cytochrome P450enzymes [I].

12 APA Practice GuidelinesPsychosocial interventions in the acute phase are aimed at reducing overstimulating or
stressful relationships, environments, or life events and at promoting relaxation or reduced
arousal through simple, clear, coherent communications and expectations; a structured andpredictable environment; low performance requirements; and tolerant, nondemanding, sup-portive relationships with the psychiatrist and other members of the treatment team. Providinginformation to the patient and the family on the nature and management of the illness that isappropriate to the patient’s capacity to assimilate information is recommended [II]. Patientscan be encouraged to collaborate with the psychiatrist in selecting and adjusting the medicationand other treatments provided [II].
The acute phase is also the best time for the psychiatrist to initiate a relationship with family
members, who tend to be particularly concerned about the patient’s disorder, disability, andprognosis during the acute phase and during hospitalization [I]. Educational meetings, “sur-vival workshops” that teach the family how to cope with schizophrenia, and referrals to localchapters of patient and family organizations such as NAMI may be helpful and are recommended[III]. Family members may be under considerable stress, particularly if the patient has been ex-hibiting dangerous or unstable behavior.
/L50776 E. STABILIZATION PHASE
During the stabilization phase, the goals of treatment are to reduce stress on the patient and pro-vide support to minimize the likelihood of relapse, enhance the patient’s adaptation to life in thecommunity, facilitate continued reduction in symptoms and consolidation of remission, andpromote the process of recovery. If the patient has improved with a particular medication regi-men, continuation of that regimen and monitoring are recommended for at least 6 months [I].Premature lowering of dose or discontinuation of medication during this phase may lead to a re-currence of symptoms and possible relapse. It is also critical to assess continuing side effects thatmay have been present in the acute phase and to adjust pharmacotherapy accordingly to mini-mize adverse side effects that may otherwise lead to medication nonadherence and relapse [I].
Psychosocial interventions remain supportive but may be less structured and directive than
in the acute phase [III]. Education about the course and outcome of the illness and about fac-tors that influence the course and outcome, including treatment adherence, can begin in this phasefor patients and continue for family members [II].
It is important that there be no gaps in service delivery, because patients are particularly vul-
nerable to relapse after an acute episode and need support in resuming their normal life andactivities in the community [I]. For hospitalized patients, it is frequently beneficial to arrangean appointment with an outpatient psychiatrist and, for patients who will reside in a commu-nity residence, to arrange a visit before discharge [II]. Adjustment to life in the community forpatients can be facilitated through realistic goal setting without undue pressure to perform athigh levels vocationally and socially, since unduly ambitious expectations can be stressful andcan increase the risk of relapse [I]. While it is critical not to place premature demands on thepatient regarding engagement in community-based activities and rehabilitation services, it isequally critical to maintain a level of momentum aimed at improving community functioningin order to instill a sense of hope and progress for the patient and family [I].
/L50776 F. STABLE PHASE
The goals of treatment during the stable phase are to ensure that symptom remission or controlis sustained, that the patient is maintaining or improving his or her level of functioning andquality of life, that increases in symptoms or relapses are effectively treated, and that monitor-ing for adverse treatment effects continues. Regular monitoring for adverse effects is recom-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 13mended [I]. If the patient agrees, it is helpful to maintain strong ties with persons who interact
with the patient frequently and would therefore be most likely to notice any resurgence ofsymptoms and the occurrence of life stresses and events that may increase the risk of relapse orimpede continuing functional recovery [II]. For most persons with schizophrenia in the stablephase, psychosocial interventions are recommended as a useful adjunctive treatment to phar-macological treatment and may improve outcomes [I].
Antipsychotic medications substantially reduce the risk of relapse in the stable phase of ill-
ness and are strongly recommended [I]. Deciding on the dose of an antipsychotic medicationduring the stable phase is complicated by the fact that there is no reliable strategy available toidentify the minimum effective dose to prevent relapse. For most patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics, a dose is recommended that is around the “extrapyramidal symptom(EPS) threshold” (i.e., the dose that will induce extrapyramidal side effects with minimal rigid-ity detectable on physical examination), since studies indicate that higher doses are usually notmore efficacious and increase the risk of subjectively intolerable side effects [II]. Lower dosesof first-generation antipsychotic medications may be associated with improved adherence andbetter subjective state and perhaps ultimately better functioning. Second-generation antipsy-chotics can generally be administered at doses that are therapeutic yet well below the “EPSthreshold.” The advantages of decreasing antipsychotic doses to minimize side effects can beweighed against the disadvantage of a somewhat greater risk of relapse and more frequent ex-acerbations of schizophrenic symptoms. In general, it is more important to prevent relapse andmaintain the stability of the patient [III].
The available antipsychotic medications are associated with differential risk of a variety of side
effects, including neurological, metabolic, sexual, endocrine, sedative, and cardiovascular side ef-fects. Monitoring of side effects based on the side effect profile of the prescribed antipsychotic iswarranted. During the stable phase of treatment it is important to routinely monitor all patientstreated with antipsychotics for extrapyramidal side effects and the development of tardive dysk-inesia [I]. Because of the risk of weight gain associated with many antipsychotics, regular mea-surement of weight and body mass index (BMI) is recommended [I]. Routine monitoring forobesity-related health problems (e.g., high blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, and clinical symp-toms of diabetes) and consideration of appropriate interventions are recommended particularlyfor patients with BMI in the overweight and obese ranges [II]. Clinicians may consider regularmonitoring of fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c levels to detect emerging diabetes, since pa-tients often have multiple risk factors for diabetes, especially patients with obesity [I].
Antipsychotic treatment often results in substantial improvement or even remission of posi-
tive symptoms. However, most patients remain functionally impaired because of negative symp-toms, cognitive deficits, and limited social function. It is important to evaluate whether residualnegative symptoms are in fact secondary to a parkinsonian syndrome or untreated major depres-sion, since interventions are available to address these causes of negative symptoms [II].
Most patients who develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are at very high
risk of relapse in the absence of antipsychotic treatment. Unfortunately, there is no reliable in-dicator to differentiate the minority who will not from the majority who will relapse with drugdiscontinuation. It is important to discuss with the patient the risks of relapse versus the long-term potential risks of maintenance treatment with the prescribed antipsychotic [I]. If a deci-sion is made to discontinue antipsychotic medication, additional precautions to minimize therisk of a psychotic relapse are warranted. Educating the patient and family members about earlysigns of relapse, advising them to develop plans for action should these signs appear, and en-couraging the patient to attend outpatient visits on a regular basis are warranted [I]. Indefinitemaintenance antipsychotic medication is recommended for patients who have had multipleprior episodes or two episodes within 5 years [I]. In patients for whom antipsychotic medica-tions have been prescribed, monitoring for signs and symptoms of impending or actual relapseis recommended [I].

14 APA Practice GuidelinesAdjunctive medications are commonly prescribed for comorbid conditions of patients in
the stable phase. Comorbid major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder may respond
to antidepressant medications [II]. Mood stabilizers may also address prominent mood lability[II]. Benzodiazepines may be helpful for managing anxiety and insomnia during the stablephase of treatment [II].
In assessing treatment resistance or partial response, it is important to carefully evaluate
whether the patient has had an adequate trial of an antipsychotic medication, including whetherthe dose is adequate and whether the patient has been taking the medication as prescribed. Aninitial trial of 4–6 weeks generally is needed to determine if the patient will have any symptom-atic response, and symptoms can continue to improve over 6 months or even longer periods ofantipsychotic treatment [II]. Given clozapine’s superior efficacy, a clozapine trial should be con-sidered for a patient who has had no response or partial and suboptimal response to two trialsof antipsychotic medication (at least one second-generation agent) or for a patient with persis-tent suicidal ideation or behavior that has not responded to other treatments [I].
A number of psychosocial treatments have demonstrated effectiveness during the stable
phase. They include family intervention [I], supported employment [I], assertive communitytreatment [I], skills training [II], and cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy [II]. In thesame way that psychopharmacological management must be individually tailored to the needsand preferences of the patient, so too should the selection of psychosocial treatments [I]. Theselection of appropriate psychosocial treatments is guided by the circumstances of the individ-ual patient’s needs and social context [II].
Interventions that educate family members about schizophrenia are needed to provide sup-
port and offer training in effective problem solving and communication, reduce symptom re-lapse, and contribute to improved patient functioning and family well-being [I]. The Programfor Assertive Community T reatment (PACT) is a specific model of community-based care thatis needed to treat patients who are at high risk for hospital readmission and who cannot bemaintained by more usual community-based treatment [I]. Persons with schizophrenia whohave residual psychotic symptoms while receiving adequate pharmacotherapy also may be of-fered cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy [II].
Supported employment is an approach to improve vocational functioning among persons
with various types of disabilities, including schizophrenia, and should be made available [I].The evidence-based supported employment programs that have been found effective includethe key elements of services focused on competitive employment, eligibility based on the con-sumer’s choice, rapid job search, integration of rehabilitation and mental health care, attentionto the consumer’s preferences, and time-unlimited and individualized support.
Social skills training may be helpful in addressing functional impairments with social skills
or activities of daily living [II]. The key elements of this intervention include behaviorally basedinstruction, modeling, corrective feedba ck, and contingent so cial reinforcement.
T reatment programs need to combine medications with a range of psychosocial services to
reduce the need for crisis-oriented hospitalizations and emergency department visits and enablegreater recovery [I].
/L50776 G. OTHER SPECIFIC TREATMENT ISSUES
1. First episode
It is important to treat schizophrenia in its initial episode as soon as possible [II]. When a pa-tient presents with a first-episode psychosis, close observation and documentation of the signsand symptoms over time are important because first episodes of psychosis can be polymorphicand evolve into a variety of specific disorders (e.g., schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder,schizoaffective disorder) [I]. Furthermore, in persons who meet the criteria for being prodromally

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 15symptomatic and at risk for psychosis in the near future, careful assessment and frequent moni-
toring are recommended until symptoms remit spontaneously, evolve into schizophrenia, orevolve into another diagnosable and treatable mental disorder [III]. The majority of first-episodepatients are responsive to treatment, with more than 70% achieving remission of psychoticsigns and symptoms within 3–4 months and 83% achieving stable remission at the end of 1 year.First-episode patients are generally more sensitive to the therapeutic effects and side effects ofmedications and often require lower doses than patients with chronic schizophrenia. Minimiz-ing risk of relapse in a remitted patient is a high priority, given the potential clinical, social, andvocational costs of relapse [I]. Family members are especially in need of education and supportat the time of the patient’s first episode [I].
2. Negative symptoms
T reatment of negative symptoms begins with assessing the patient for syndromes that can causethe appearance of secondary negative symptoms [I]. The treatment of such secondary negativesymptoms consists of treating their cause, e.g., antipsychotics for primary positive symptoms,antidepressants for depression, anxiolytics for anxiety disorders, or antiparkinsonian agents orantipsychotic dose reduction for extrapyramidal side effects [III]. If negative symptoms persist,they are presumed to be primary negative symptoms of the deficit state. There are no treatmentswith proven efficacy for primary negative symptoms.
3. Substance use disorders
Nearly one-half of patients with schizophrenia have comorbid substance use disorders, exclud-ing nicotine abuse/dependence, which itself exceeds 50% in prevalence in this group. The goalsof treatment for patients with schizophrenia who also have a substance use disorder are thesame as those for treatment of patients with schizophrenia without comorbidity but with theaddition of the goals for the treatment of substance use disorders, e.g., harm reduction, absti-nence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. A comprehensive integrated treatment model isrecommended in which the same clinicians or team of clinicians provide treatment for schizo-phrenia as well as treatment of substance use disorders [III]. This form of treatment featuresassertive outreach, case management, family interventions, housing, rehabilitation, and phar-macotherapy. It also includes behavioral interventions for those who are trying to attain ormaintain abstinence and a stage-wise motivational approach for patients who do not recognizethe need for treatment of a substance use disorder.
4. Depression
Depressive symptoms are common at all phases of schizophrenia. A careful differential diagno-sis that considers the contributions of side effects of antipsychotic medications, demoralization,the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and substance intoxication or withdrawal is recom-mended [I]. Depressive symptoms that occur during the acute psychotic phase usually improveas patients recover from the psychosis. There is also evidence to suggest that depressive symp-toms are reduced by antipsychotic treatment, with comparison trials finding that second-generation antipsychotics may have greater efficacy for depressive symptoms than first-genera-tion antipsychotics [II]. Antidepressants may be added as an adjunct to antipsychotics whenthe depressive symptoms meet the syndromal criteria for major depressive disorder or are se-vere, causing significant distress or interfering with function [II].
5. Suicidal and aggressive behaviors
Suicide is the leading cause of premature death among patients with schizophrenia. Some riskfactors for suicide among patients with schizophrenia are the same as those for the general pop-

16 APA Practice Guidelinesulation: male gender, white race, single marital status, social isolation, unemployment, a family
history of suicide, previous suicide attempts, substance use disorders, depression or hopeless-ness, and a significant recent adverse life event. Specific demographic risk factors for suicideamong persons with schizophrenia are young age, high socioeconomic status background, highIQ with a high level of premorbid scholastic achievement, high aspirations and expectations,early age at onset/first hospitalization, a chronic and deteriorating course with many relapses,and greater insight into the illness.
Despite identification of these risk factors, it is not possible to predict whether an individual
patient will attempt suicide or die by suicide. It is important to consider suicide risk at all stagesof the illness and to perform an initial suicide risk assessment and regular evaluation of suiciderisk as part of each patient’s psychiatric evaluation [I]. There is evidence to suggest that bothfirst- and second-generation antipsychotic medications may reduce the risk of suicide. Howev-er, clozapine is the most extensively studied and has been shown to reduce the rates of suicide[II] and persistent suicidal behavior [I].
During a hospitalization, use of suicide precautions and careful monitoring over time for
suicidal patients are essential [I]. Upon discharge, the patient and the family members may beadvised to look for warning signs and to initiate specific contingency plans if suicidal ideationrecurs [I]. After a recent discharge from the hospital, a higher frequency of outpatient visits isrecommended, and the number of visits may need to be increased during times of personal cri-sis, significant environmental changes, heightened distress, or deepening depression during thecourse of illness [III].
A minority of patients with schizophrenia have an increased risk for aggressive behavior. The
risk for aggressive behavior increases with comorbid alcohol abuse, substance abuse, antisocialpersonality, or neurological impairment. Identifying risk factors for aggressive behavior and as-sessment of dangerousness are part of a standard psychiatric evaluation [I].
/L50776 H. TREATMENT SETTINGS AND HOUSING OPTIONS
Patients with schizophrenia may receive care in a variety of settings. In general, patients shouldbe cared for in the least restrictive setting that is likely to be safe and to allow for effective treat-ment [I]. Indications for hospitalization usually include the patient’s being considered to posea serious threat of harm to self or others or being unable to care for self and needing constantsupervision or support [I]. Other possible indications for hospitalization include general med-ical or psychiatric problems that make outpatient treatment unsafe or ineffective [III] or newonset of psychosis [III]. Efforts should be made to hospitalize such patients voluntarily [I].
T reatment programs that emphasize highly structured behavioral techniques, including a
token economy, point systems, and skills training that can improve patients’ functioning, arerecommended for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who require long-term hos-pitalization [I].
When it is uncertain whether the patient needs to be hospitalized, alternative treatment in
the community, such as day hospitalization, home care, family crisis therapy, crisis residentialcare, or assertive community treatment, should be considered [III]. Day hospitalization can beused as an immediate alternative to inpatient care for acutely psychotic patients or used to con-tinue stabilization after a brief hospital stay [III].
Day treatment programs can be used to provide ongoing supportive care for marginally ad-
justed patients with schizophrenia in the later part of the stabilization phase and the stablephase of illness, and such programs are usually not time-limited [III]. The goals are to providestructure, support, and treatment to help prevent relapse and to maintain and gradually im-prove the patient’s social functioning [III].

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 17II. FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF A TREATMENT PLAN
Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness that affects virtually all aspects of life of affected per-
sons, treatment planning has three goals: 1) reduce or eliminate symptoms, 2) maximize qualityof life and adaptive functioning, and 3) enable recovery by assisting patients in attaining per-sonal life goals (e.g., in work, housing, and relationships). For purposes of presentationthroughout this guideline, the course of treatment for persons with schizophrenia is dividedinto three phases: acute, stabilization, and stable. The acute phase begins with a new onset or acuteexacerbation of symptoms and spans the period until these symptoms are reduced to a levelconsidered to be the patient’s expected “baseline.” The stabilization period follows the acutephase and constitutes a time-limited transition to continuing treatment in the stable phase.Combined, the acute and stabilization phases generally span approximately 6 months. The sta-ble phase represents a prolonged period of treatment and rehabilitation during which symp-toms are under adequate control and the focus is on improving functioning and recovery.While these distinctions may be somewhat arbitrary, they provide a useful framework for dis-cussion of treatment.
Many of the advances in the treatment of schizophrenia over the past two decades have
come from recognition of the complexities of the manifestations and the different stages of theillness. These insights into the multiple components of psychopathology in schizophrenia andinto the role of family, social, and other environmental factors in influencing both psychopa-thology and adaptation have resulted in development of a wide range of treatments that targetspecific aspects of the illness. Recognition of the different stages of the illness has led to variousapproaches in treatment planning, treatment selection, and drug dosing. Fragmentation of ser-vices and treatments has long been a problem in delivering comprehensive care to persons withschizophrenia. This fragmentation is determined by several factors, including the use of manydifferent treatment settings, the necessary involvement of several professional disciplines, andthe use of multiple funding streams, coupled with inadequate insurance coverage and the de-cline in funding for public and private mental health services, to mention just a few. It is crit-ical, under these circumstances, that there be an overarching treatment plan that serves theshort- and long-term needs of the patient and that is periodically modified as clinical circum-stances change and new knowledge about treatments becomes available.
/L50776 A. PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT
This section is an overview of key issues in the psychiatric management of patients with schizo-phrenia. It highlights areas that research has shown to be important in affecting the course ofillness and success of treatment. These issues arise in the management of all psychiatric illness-es. This section notes the particular ways in which they occur in the treatment of patients withschizophrenia.
1. Assessing symptoms and establishing a diagnosis
Effective and appropriate treatments are based on accurate, relevant diagnostic and clinical as-sessments. In the case of schizophrenia, the diagnosis has major implications for short- andlong-term treatment planning. (See Part B, Section IV .A, “Clinical Features,” for a descriptionof the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnosis of

18 APA Practice Guidelinesthe illness.) It is beyond the scope of this guideline to discuss the differential diagnosis of psy-
chotic disorders and their evaluation. However, it is important to note that diagnosis is a pro-cess rather than a one-time event. As new information becomes available about the patient andhis or her symptoms, the patient’s diagnosis should be reevaluated and, if necessary, the treat-ment plan changed.
Proper diagnosis, while essential, is insufficient to adequately guide treatment of schizophre-
nia. Treatments are directed at the manifestations and sequelae of schizophrenia. It is critical toidentify the targets of each treatment, to have outcome measures that gauge the effect of treat-ment, and to have realistic expectations about the degrees of improvement that constitute suc-cessful treatment. Depression, suicide, homelessness, substance use disorders, medicalcomorbidities, social isolation, joblessness, criminal victimization, past sexual or physical abuse,and involvement in the criminal justice system are all far more common among persons withschizophrenia, particularly in the chronic stages of the illness, than in the general population.In addition to the core symptoms of schizophrenia, these areas need careful assessment and, aswarranted, appropriate interventions.
A number of objective, quantitative rating scales to monitor clinical status in schizophrenia
are available, as described in the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA’s) Handbook of Psychi-
atric Measures  (1). They include the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (2) for establish-
ing diagnosis, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (3) for monitoring tardive dyskinesiaand other abnormal movements, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (4–6) and thePositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (7) for monitoring psychopathology. Otherbrief structured assessments are also available (8, 9). There are several reasons that use of ratingscales is important. First, rating scales provide a record that documents the patient’s response totreatment. This record is of particular value when the treatment is nonstandard (e.g., combina-tion of antipsychotics) or expensive. Second, the ratings can be compared with the patient’s,family members’, and clinician’s impressions of treatment effects and over time can clarify thelongitudinal course of the patient’s illness. This process can help temper excessive optimismwhen new treatments are begun and can provide useful information about the actual effects ofprior treatments. Third, use of anchored scales with criteria to assess the severity and frequencyof symptoms helps patients become more informed self-observers. Finally, use of the rating scalesover time ensures that information about the same areas is collected at each administration andhelps avoid omission of key elements of information needed to guide treatment.
2. Developing a plan of treatment
After the assessment of the patient’s diagnosis and clinical and psychosocial circumstances, atreatment plan must be formulated and implemented. This process involves the selection of thetreatment modalities, specific type(s) of treatment, and treatment setting. Depending on theacuity of the clinical situation and because information about the patient’s history and fromthe clinical evaluation may only gradually become available, this process can be iterative andevolve over the course of the patient’s association with the clinician. Indeed, formulation andperiodic reevaluation of the treatment plan at different phases of implementation and stages ofillness are essential to good clinical practice. This process is described in greater detail in thesubsequent sections on the various phases of illness, treatment settings, and types of treatments.
3. Developing a therapeutic alliance and promoting treatment adherence
It is essential for the psychiatrist who is treating the patient to establish and maintain a sup-portive therapeutic alliance, which forms the foundation on which treatment is conducted(10). Such an alliance allows the psychiatrist to gain essential information about the patient andallows the patient to develop trust in the psychiatrist and a desire to collaborate in treatment.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 19T o facilitate this process, continuity of care with the same psychiatrist over time is recommend-
ed, allowing the psychiatrist to learn more about the patient as a person and the individual vi-cissitudes of the disorder over time. However, while continuity is desirable, it does not ensurequality, and continuity of inadequate treatment can be highly problematic.
Research indicates that specific attention in the therapeutic relationship to identifying the
patient’s goals and aspirations and relating them to treatment outcomes increases treatment ad-herence (11). Moreover, evidence supports the conclusion that the most effective medicationadherence strategies focus on the patient’s attitudes and behaviors with respect to medicationrather than taking a general psychoeducational approach (12).
Not uncommonly, patients with schizophrenia stop taking medications, miss clinic ap-
pointments, fail to report essential information to their psychiatrists, and otherwise choose tonot participate in recommended treatments. T o address partial or full treatment nonadherence,the clinician should first assess contributing factors. Potential factors can be broadly conceptu-alized under the health belief model, which assumes adherence behavior is dynamic and influ-enced by a patient’s beliefs about need for treatment, the potential risks and benefits oftreatment, barriers to treatment, and social support for adhering to treatment (13). Frequentcauses of poor adherence are lack of insight (14), breakdown of the therapeutic alliance, dis-crimination associated with the illness, cultural beliefs, failure to understand the need to takedaily medication even in the stable phase, cognitive impairment (15, 16), and experience ofunpleasant medication side effects such as akathisia (17, 18). Most patients have some ambiva-lence about taking antipsychotic medications, all of which can be associated with unpleasantand, rarely, dangerous side effects. Even patients with good insight into their symptoms or ill-ness may not perceive their prescribed medication as potentially or actually helpful. Patientswho do experience troublesome or serious side effects may decide that these effects outweighthe benefits of medication. Finally, people important to the patient, including family andfriends, may discourage the patient from taking medication or participating in other aspects oftreatment.
Once the reasons for incomplete adherence are understood, clinical interventions can be im-
plemented to address them. For example, encouraging the patient to report side effects and at-tempting to diminish or eliminate them can significantly improve medication adherence. Also,it is important for patients who are relatively asymptomatic in the stable phase to understandthat medication may be prophylactic in preventing relapse (19, 20). If a patient stops takingmedication during the stable phase, he or she may feel better, with less sedation or other sideeffects. As a result, the patient may come to the false conclusion that the medication is not nec-essary or does not have benefits. As will be described in later sections, psychotherapeutic tech-niques based on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior techniques may enhanceinsight and treatment adherence. In situations in which patients choose not to adhere to pre-scribed psychosocial interventions, a careful review of the patient’s perceptions of the goals ofthe treatment and its likelihood for success is recommended.
The clinician may also help to identify practical barriers to adherence, such as cognitive im-
pairments or disorganization that interferes with a willing patient’s regular taking of medicationor participation in treatment. Use of simple aids, such as a pillbox placed in a prominent loca-tion in the home and a watch with an alarm, can enhance adherence. Family members and sig-nificant others can also be involved, for example, by helping the patient fill the pillbox and byregularly monitoring adherence. Patients without health care insurance may have difficulty af-fording even generic antipsychotics or basic psychosocial services. The clinician may help withaccess to medications by suggesting and completing the physician’s sections of the applicationfor patients’ assistance programs offered by most pharmaceutical companies. Some patientsmay not have transportation to the pharmacy or to physician appointments and other treat-ment services. For patients who are parents, lack of child care may also pose a barrier to attend-ing appointments.

20 APA Practice GuidelinesFor some patients, medication with a longer elimination half-life or long-acting injectable
medications are options that may improve treatment adherence or minimize nonadherence. It
is also important to note that the half-lives of oral antipsychotic medications vary widely. Forpatients who are prone to forget doses or are intermittently nonadherent to treatment, drugswith slower rates of metabolism may be used preferentially.
When a patient does not appear for appointments or is nonadherent in other ways, assertive
outreach, including telephone calls and home visits, when appropriate, may be very helpful inreengaging the patient in treatment. This outreach can be carried out by the psychiatrist or oth-er designated team member (e.g., of an assertive community treatment team), when available,in consultation with the psychiatrist. For some patients, nonadherence with care is frequentand is associated with repeated cycles of decompensation and rehospitalization. Particularly forpatients who pose ongoing risks to self or others as a result of nonadherence, many states nowhave programs available for mandatory outpatient treatment (sometimes referred to as outpa-tient commitment). Although some have questioned whether mandatory outpatient treatmentincreases patients’ reluctance to seek help voluntarily (21–23), a growing body of evidence sug-gests that a number of benefits may occur with mandatory outpatient treatment for appropri-ately selected patients when it incorporates intensive individualized outpatient services for anextended period of time. In addition to enhanced adherence, most (24–27) but not all (28)studies show mandatory outpatient treatment to be associated with benefits, including reduc-tions in substance use and abuse, decreases in violent incidents, reductions in the likelihood ofbeing criminally victimized, and improvements in quality of life in appropriately targeted pa-tients. Thus, for a small subgroup of patients with repeated relapses and rehospitalizationsassociated with nonadherence, mandatory outpatient treatment can be a useful approach toimproved adherence and enhanced outcomes (29).
4. Providing patient and family education and therapies
Working with patients to recognize early symptoms of relapse can result in preventing full-blown illness exacerbations (30). Family education about the nature of the illness and copingstrategies can markedly diminish relapses and improve quality of life for patients (31). For gen-eral educational purposes, a variety of useful written materials about schizophrenia is available.The interventions that have been shown to be effective, however, involve face-to-face interac-tions in individual or group sessions for a total of at least 9–12 months, with the availability ofcrisis intervention and problem-solving tasks as a central element of the therapy.
5. Treating comorbid conditions
As already noted, a number of psychiatric, social, and other medical conditions occur far morefrequently in persons with schizophrenia than in the general population. Periodic assessment ofthese conditions by the treatment team is important. Commonly co-occurring major depres-sion, substance use disorders, and PTSD are usually identifiable through clinical examinationsand discussions with the patient and significant others, combined with longitudinal observationof the patient’s behavior patterns. Each of these conditions deserves attention and possibly treat-ment in its own right, with such treatment concurrent with that for schizophrenia. Substanceuse disorders, in particular, complicate assessment and treatment of schizophrenia, but delayingtreatment of the psychotic disorder until the substance use disorder is under control is not rec-ommended, as untreated psychosis is likely to be associated with increased substance use (32).
Section II.F .3, “Concurrent General Medical Conditions,” discusses nonpsychiatric medical
conditions that are commonly comorbid with schizophrenia. Certain illnesses, such as diabetes,are more common in persons with schizophrenia and have also been associated with some sec-ond-generation antipsychotic medications. Nicotine dependence is also common among per-sons with schizophrenia and contributes to the increased risk of physical illnesses (33, 34). It isimportant that patients have access to primary care clinicians who can work with the psychia-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 21trist to diagnose and treat concurrent general medical conditions and that the psychiatrist
maintain competence in screening for common medical conditions and for providing ongoingmonitoring and treatment of common medical conditions in conjunction with primary careclinicians.
6. Attending to the patient’s social circumstances and functioning
The social circumstances and functioning of the patient can have profound effects on adher-ence and response to treatment. The patient’s living situation, family involvement, sources andamount of income, legal status, and relationships with significant others (including children)can both produce stress and be protective; thus, all are areas where periodic exploration by men-tal health care clinicians is warranted. A frequently neglected aspect of social assessment is theparenting role of patients with children (35, 36). The patient’s sexuality is also often not ade-quately assessed, not only from the standpoint of adverse medication effects, but in terms ofsexual relations and practices.
Depending on the nature of the problem in the patient’s social circumstances, other mental
health professionals may need to be involved in achieving its resolution. The psychiatrist canwork with team members, the patient, and the family to ensure that such services are coordi-nated and that referrals for additional services are made when appropriate. It is important thatdisability income support is secured when indicated.
7. Integrating treatments from multiple clinicians
Many patients with schizophrenia require a variety of treatments, often from multiple clini-cians. This requirement creates the potential for fragmentation of treatment efforts for patientswho frequently have problems with planning and organizing. In many settings integration oftreatments is best accomplished through designation of treatment teams, led by a psychiatristor other skilled mental health professional, that meet periodically to review progress and goalsand to identify obstacles to improvement. So-called case management, which provides the pa-tient assistance in gaining access to community services and resources, is often useful to facilitateintegration of treatments. Either several members of a team or one person can be assigned to bethe case manager, ensuring that the patient receives coordinated, continuous, and comprehen-sive services. For example, the case manager may accompany the patient to a welfare agency, visitthe patient’s home if a clinical appointment is missed, or convene a meeting of workers fromdifferent agencies serving the patient to formulate an overall treatment plan in conjunction withthe psychiatrist. There are a variety of educational and organizational approaches to buildingteams and programs that facilitate the goal of integrated treatment (37, 38).
8. Documenting treatment
Whether treated in the private or public sector, most persons with schizophrenia will havemany different practitioners over the course of their illness. These transitions result fromchanges in treatment venues (inpatient, outpatient, assertive community treatment, etc.), pro-gram availability, insurance, the patient’s locale, and clinic personnel. Because an accurate his-tory of past and current treatments and responses to them is a key ingredient to treatmentplanning, excellent documentation is paramount. Especially critical, for example, is informa-tion about prior medication trials, including doses, length of time at specific doses, side effects,and clinical response. Despite the importance of an accurate history, studies of the adequacy ofdocumentation (39) and clinical experience illustrate the extraordinary difficulty encounteredin efforts to piece together a coherent story from the medical records of most patients withschizophrenia. Although actual chart documentation is the responsibility of the individualpractitioner, it is typically the employing or contracting organization that is in the best positionto facilitate good documentation and to effect periodic overviews of treatment. Appropriatedocumentation of assessment of competency, informed consent for treatment, and release ofinformation also deserve careful attention by the clinician and the treatment organization.

22 APA Practice GuidelinesWithin the organization there are at least two major issues in information management.
From the standpoint of information collection, the organization and its practitioners need to
agree on the critical elements of information to obtain and the frequency with which theyshould be obtained. Recording of information may occur contemporaneously with collectionor immediately thereafter. Labor-saving forms (paper or computer-based) may help in prompt-ing data collection and easing its recording. Once information is collected, the ability to gainaccess to the information is essential. Thus, the organization will want to develop plans so thatmedical records will be available whenever and wherever the patient is seen. In addition, if thepatient’s care is transferred from one practitioner to another (e.g., outpatient to inpatient), nec-essary information will need to be transferred to the new practitioner ahead of or along with thepatient. Release of a patient’s information will generally require the patient’s consent and shouldconform to applicable regulations and policies (e.g., state law, the Health Insurance Portabilityand Accountability Act, and Principles of Medical Ethics: With Annotations Especially Applicableto Psychiatry  [40]).
/L50776 B. ACUTE PHASE
The goals of treatment during the acute phase of a psychotic exacerbation are to prevent harm,control disturbed behavior, reduce the severity of psychosis and associated symptoms (e.g., ag-itation, aggression, negative symptoms, affective symptoms), determine and address the factorsthat led to the occurrence of the acute episode, effect a rapid return to the best level of func-tioning, develop an alliance with the patient and family, formulate short- and long-term treat-ment plans, and connect the patient with appropriate aftercare in the community. It isespecially important to address the anxiety, fear, and dysphoria commonly associated with anacute episode. Efforts to engage and collaborate with family members and other natural care-givers are often successful during the crisis of an acute psychotic episode, whether it is the firstepisode or a relapse. Also, family members and other caregivers are often needed to provide sup-port to the patient while he or she is recovering from an acute episode. The main therapeuticchallenge for the clinician is to select and “titrate” the doses of both pharmacological and psy-chosocial interventions in accordance with the symptoms and sociobehavioral functioning ofthe patient (41). It is important to emphasize that acute-phase treatment is often but no longernecessarily associated with hospitalization. With the growth of managed care restricting the useof hospitalization and the development of alternative community-based programs, acute-phasetreatment frequently occurs outside of the hospital.
1. Assessment in the acute phase
A thorough initial workup, including complete psychiatric and general medical histories andphysical and mental status examinations, is recommended for all patients, as allowed by the pa-tient’s clinical status. Interviews of family members or other persons knowledgeable about thepatient should be conducted routinely unless the patient refuses to grant permission, especiallysince many patients are unable to provide a reliable history at the first interview. In emergencycircumstances, as when a patient’s safety is at risk, it may be necessary and permissible to speakwith others without the patient’s consent.
When a patient is in an acute psychotic state, acutely agitated, or both, it may be impossible
to perform an adequate evaluation at the time of the initial contact. With the patient’s consent,the psychiatrist may begin treatment with an appropriate medication and perform the neces-sary evaluations as the patient’s condition improves and permits. For acutely psychotic or agi-tated patients who lack the capacity or are unwilling to agree to receive medication, stateregulations on involuntary treatment should be followed.
Some of the most common contributors to symptom relapse are antipsychotic medication
nonadherence, substance use, and stressful life events (42–47). Medication adherence may be

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 23assessed by the patient’s report, the reports of family members or other caregivers, pill counts,
prescription refill counts, and, for some medications, antipsychotic blood levels. Attentionneeds to be given to potential drug-drug interactions that may affect blood levels and hencetoxicity and adherence. Useful guides for determining potential adverse drug interactions relatedto the cytochrome P450 enzyme system are now available (48, 49). The reason for nonadher-ence should also be evaluated and considered in the treatment plan.
General medical health as well as medical conditions that could contribute to symptom ex-
acerbation can be evaluated by medical history; physical and neurological examination; and ap-propriate laboratory, electrophysiological, and radiological assessments. Substance use shouldbe routinely evaluated as part of the medical history and with a urine toxicology screen. It isimportant to realize that many drugs of abuse, including most designer drugs and hallucino-gens, are not detected by urine toxicology screens; if use of such substances is suspected, a bloodtoxicology screen can detect some of them. Withdrawal from alcohol or some other substancescan present as worsening psychosis, and the possibility of withdrawal should be evaluated bymedical history and vital sign monitoring in all patients with acute exacerbation of symptoms.(The results of toxicology screens will usually be negative, since risk of withdrawal is often high-est several days after abstinence from chronic abuse.) Body weight and vital signs (heart rate,blood pressure, temperature) should be measured. A CT or MRI scan may provide helpful in-formation, particularly in assessing patients with a new onset of psychosis or with an atypicalclinical presentation. Although imaging studies cannot establish a diagnosis of schizophrenia, spe-cific findings from a CT or MRI scan (e.g., ventricular enlargement, diminished cortical volume)may enhance the confidence of the diagnosis and provide information that is relevant to treat-ment planning and prognosis. Given the subtle nature of the neuropathological findings inschizophrenia, MRI is preferred over CT.
Table 1 delineates suggested laboratory tests for evaluating health status, including studies
that may be indicated when the clinical picture is unclear or when there are abnormal findingson routine examination, as well as suggested methods to monitor for side effects of treatment.
These tests may detect occult disease that is contributing to psychosis and also determine if
there are comorbid medical conditions that might affect medication selection, such as impairedliver or renal function. Tests to assess other general medical needs of patients should also beconsidered (e.g., gynecological examination, mammogram, and rectal examination) (54). TheU.S. Preventive Services Task Force has reviewed the evidence of effectiveness and developedrecommendations for clinical preventive services (http://www.ahcpr.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm).
It is also important that special precautions be taken in the presence of suicidal ideation or
intent or a suicide plan, including an assessment of risk factors such as prior attempts, de-pressed mood, and suicidal ideation, which are the best predictors of a subsequent suicide at-tempt in schizophrenia (55, 56). Other predictors of suicide that also warrant close attentioninclude the presence of command hallucinations, hopelessness, anxiety, extrapyramidal sideeffects, and an alcohol or other substance use disorder. Similar evaluations are necessary in con-sidering the likelihood of dangerous or aggressive behavior and whether the person will harmsomeone else or engage in other forms of violence (57). The coexistence of substance use (58)significantly increases the risk of violent behavior. Because past behavior best predicts futurebehavior, family members and friends are often helpful in determining the risk of a patient’sharming self or others and in assessing the patient’s ability for self-care.
2. Psychiatric management in the acute phase
Psychosocial interventions in the acute phase are aimed at reducing overstimulating or stressfulrelationships, environments, or life events and at promoting relaxation or reduced arousal throughsimple, clear, coherent communication and expectations; a structured and predictable environ-ment; low performance requirements; and tolerant, nondemanding, supportive relationshipswith the psychiatrist and other members of the treatment team.

aBMI may be calculated by using the formula weight in kg/(height in m)2 or the formula 703 × weight in lb/(height in inches)2 or by using a BMI table available from the National Institute of 
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health/nutrit/pubs/statobes.htm#table). A person with a BM I >25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, and one with a BMI of 30 
or higher is considered obese. As an alternative to BMI, waist size can be used as an indicator of risk (>35 inches for women a nd >40 inches for men).
bExcept for patients with a BMI of <18.5, an increase in BMI of 1 BMI unit would suggest a need for intervention by monitoring w eight more closely, engaging the patient in a weight management 
program, using an adjunctive treatment to reduce weight, or changing the antipsychotic medication.
cAlthough this practice guideline recommends that patients treated with antipsychotic medications be monitored for physical cond itions and side effects on a regular basis, there are no absolute 
criteria for frequency of monitoring. Occurrence of conditions and side effects may be influenced by the patient’s history, pre existing conditions, and use of other medications in addition to 
antipsychotic agents. Thus, decisions about monitoring patients for physical conditions, specific side effects, or abnormalitie s in laboratory test results will necessarily depend on the clinical 
circumstances. In general, baseline assessments related to physical conditions and specific medication-related side effects wil l be done at the time of initiating or changing antipsychotic medications or 
when adding other medications that contribute to these side effects. Information in this section of the table is adapted from t he recommendations of the October 2002 Mount Sinai Conference on 
Health Monitoring of Patients With Schizophrenia (50).
dThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has requested all manufacturers of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medications  to include a warning in their product labeling regarding 
hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. Although precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events are not available  for each agent, epidemiological studies suggested an increased risk of 
treatment-emergent adverse events with second-generation antipsychotics. In some patients, this hyperglycemia was extreme and/o r associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death.
eFactors that indicate an increased risk for undiagnosed diabetes include a BMI greater than 25, a first-degree relative with di abetes, habitual physical inactivity, being a member of a high-risk ethnic 
population (African American, Hispanic American, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander), having delivered a baby he avier than 9 lbs or having had gestational diabetes, hypertension, a 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level <35 mg/dl and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dl, history of abnormal findings on th e glucose tolerance test or an abnormal level of fasting blood glucose, and 
history of vascular disease (51). Symptoms of possible diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, u nusual weight loss, increased fatigue, irritability, and blurry vision.
fAs an alternative to measurement of fasting blood glucose, a hemoglobin A1c level may be obtained. An abnormal value (fasting b lood glucose >110 mg/dl or hemoglobin A1c >6.1%) suggests a 
need for medical consultation. More frequent monitoring may be indicated in the presence of weight change, symptoms of diabetes , or a random measure of blood glucose >200 mg/dl.
gAdditional information on screening of patients for possible lipid disorders can be found in the guidelines of the National Cho lesterol Education Program (52) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force (53).
hIn this context, cardiac risk factors include known heart disease, a personal history of syncope, a family history of sudden de ath at an early age (under age 40, especially if both parents had sudden 
death), or prolonged QTc syndrome.
iChanges in libido, menstrual changes, or galactorrhea in women; changes in libido or in erectile or ejaculatory function in men .
jPatients at increased risk for developing abnormal involuntary movements include elderly patients and patients who experience a cute dystonic reactions, other clinically significant extrapyramidal 
side effects, or akathisias.TABLE 1. Suggested Physical and Laboratory Assessments for Patients With Schizophrenia  (continued)

26 APA Practice GuidelinesThe patient should be provided information on the nature and management of the illness
that is appropriate to his or her ability to assimilate information. The patient should also be en-
couraged to collaborate with the psychiatrist in selecting and adjusting the medication and othertreatments provided. Ordinarily, a hospitalized patient should be provided with some informa-tion about the disorder and the medications being used to treat it, including their benefits andside effects. As described in Section II.A.3, “Developing a Therapeutic Alliance and PromotingTreatment Adherence,” the psychiatrist must realize that the degree of acceptance of medicationand information about it will vary according to the patient’s cognitive capacity, the extent of thepatient’s insight, and efforts made by the psychiatrist to engage the patient and the patient’s fam-ily members in a collaborative treatment relationship.
The acute phase is also the best time for the psychiatrist to initiate a relationship with family
members, who tend to be particularly concerned about the patient’s disorder, disability, andprognosis during this phase and during hospitalization. Educational meetings, “survival work-shops” that teach the family how to cope with schizophrenia, and referrals to the local chapterof NAMI may be helpful. The NAMI web site (http://www.nami.org) offers a wealth of usefulinformation. Manuals, workbooks, and videotapes are also available to aid families in this pro-cess (59–64). Active efforts to involve relatives in treatment planning and implementation areoften a critical component of treatment.
3. Use of antipsychotic medications in the acute phase
T reatment with antipsychotic medication is indicated for nearly all episodes of acute psychosisin patients with schizophrenia. In this guideline the term “antipsychotic” refers to several classesof medications (Table 2). These include the first-generation antipsychotic medications and thesecond-generation (sometimes referred to as “atypical”) agents clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine,quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole.
Pharmacological treatment should be initiated as soon as is clinically feasible, because acute
psychotic exacerbations are associated with emotional distress, disruption to the patient’s life,and a substantial risk of behaviors that are dangerous to self, others, or property (57, 68, 69). Thereare limited circumstances where it may be appropriate to delay treatment, for example, for pa-tients who require more extensive or prolonged diagnostic evaluation, who refuse medications,or who may experience a rapid recovery because substance use or acute stress reactions arethought to be the potential cause of the symptom exacerbation.
Before treatment with antipsychotic medication is begun, baseline laboratory studies may
be indicated, if they have not already been obtained as a part of the initial assessment (Table 1).In addition, the treating physician should, as is feasible, discuss the potential risks and benefitsof the medication with the patient. The depth of this discussion will, of course, be determinedby the patient’s condition. Even with agitated patients and patients with thought disorder,however, the therapeutic alliance will be enhanced if the patient and physician can identify tar-get symptoms (e.g., anxiety, poor sleep, and, for patients with insight, hallucinations and delu-sions) that are subjectively distressing and that antipsychotics can ameliorate. Acute side effectssuch as orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and extrapyramidal side effects, including dystonicreactions, insomnia, or sedation, should be discussed at this stage, leaving discussion of long-term side effects to when the acute episode is resolving. Mentioning the possibility of acute sideeffects helps patients to identify and report their occurrence and also may help maintain a ther-apeutic alliance. To the extent possible, it is important to minimize acute side effects of anti-psychotic medications, such as dystonia, that can significantly influence a patient’s willingnessto accept and continue pharmacological treatment. Patients with schizophrenia often have at-tentional and other cognitive impairments that may be more severe during an acute illness ex-acerbation, and so it is often helpful to return to the topic of identifying target symptoms andrisk of acute side effects multiple times during the course of hospitalization.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 27Rapid initiation of emergency treatment is needed when an acutely psychotic patient is ex-
hibiting aggressive behaviors toward self, others, or objects. When the patient is in an emergency
department, inpatient unit, or other acute treatment facility, existing therapeutic protocolsusually define the appropriate response. Most of these protocols recognize that the patient isusually frightened and confused and that the first intervention involves staff members talking tothe patient in an attempt to calm him or her. Attempts to restrain the patient should be doneonly by a team trained in safe restraint procedures to minimize risk of harm to patients or staff(70). Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often helpful in reducing the patient’s level of ag-itation (71). If the patient will take oral medication, rapidly dissolving forms of olanzapine andrisperidone can be used for quicker effect and to reduce nonadherence. If a patient refuses oralmedication, most states allow for emergency administration despite the patient’s objection.Short-acting parenteral formulations of first- and second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g.,haloperidol, ziprasidone, and olanzapine), with or without a parenteral benzodiazepine (e.g.,lorazepam), are available for emergency administration in acutely agitated patients (72–79). Useof rapidly dissolving oral formulations of second-generation agents (e.g., olanzapine, risperi-done) or oral concentrate formulations (e.g., risperidone, haloperidol) may also be useful forTABLE 2.

28 APA Practice Guidelinesacute agitation. Other medications, such as droperidol, can be used in selected clinical situations
of extreme emergency or in highly agitated patients (80). However, if droperidol is used, its po-tential for cardiac rhythm disturbances must be considered, as indicated in its labeling by a black-box warning for QTc prolongation.
In nonemergency circumstances in which the patient is refusing medication, the physician
may have limited options. When a patient refuses medication, it is often helpful to enlist familymembers as allies in helping the patient to accept medication. Often, patients can be helped toaccept pharmacological treatment over time and with psychotherapeutic interactions that areaimed toward identifying subjectively distressing symptoms that have previously responded totreatment (12). Clinicians are encouraged to make greater use of the option of advance direc-tives by patients in states where this option is available. Advance directives allow competent pa-tients to state their preferences about treatment choices in the event of future decompensationand acute incapacity to make decisions. Depending on prevailing state laws, when treatmentmeasures instituted on the basis of an advance directive fail, pharmacological treatment may beadministered involuntarily even in the absence of acute dangerousness (81). In other instances,depending on state laws, a judicial hearing may need to be sought for permission to treat a pa-tient who lacks capacity.
The process for determining pharmacological treatment in the acute phase is shown in Table 3
and Figure 1.
The selection of an antipsychotic medication is frequently guided by the patient’s previous
experience with antipsychotics, including the degree of symptom response, the side effect pro-file (including past experience of side effects such as dysphoria), and the patient’s preferencesfor a particular medication, including the route of administration. The second-generation anti-psychotics should be considered as first-line medications for patients in the acute phase ofschizophrenia, mainly because of the decreased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and tardivedyskinesia (82–85), with the understanding that there continues to be debate over the relativeTABLE 3.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 29advantages, disadvantages, and cost-effectiveness of first- and second-generation agents (86–
89). For patients who have been treated successfully in the past or who prefer first-generationagents, these medications are clinically useful and for specific patients may be the first choice.With the possible exception of clozapine for patients with treatment-resistant symptoms, anti-psychotics generally have similar efficacy in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia,although there is emerging evidence and ongoing debate that second-generation antipsychoticsmay have superior efficacy in treating global psychopathology and cognitive, negative, andmood symptoms. To date, there is no definitive evidence that one second-generation antipsy-chotic will have superior efficacy compared with another, although in an individual patientthere may be clinically meaningful differences in response (89). A patient’s past history of sideeffects can guide antipsychotic drug selection, since there is considerable difference in side ef-fect profiles among the available antipsychotics.

Table 1 and discussed in detail in Part B, Section V.A.1, “Antipsychotic Medications.”
While many patients prefer oral medication, patients with recurrent relapses related to par-
tial or full nonadherence are candidates for a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication,as are patients who prefer the injectable formulation (91). If a long-acting injectable medicationis indicated, the oral form of the same medication (i.e., fluphenazine, haloperidol, and risperi-done in the United States) is the logical choice for initial treatment during the acute phase. Thetransition from oral to long-acting injectable medication can begin during the acute phase;however, the long-acting injectable agents are not usually prescribed for acute psychotic epi-sodes because these medications can take months to reach a stable steady state and are elimi-nated very slowly (92). As a result, the psychiatrist has relatively little control over the amountof medication the patient is receiving, and it is difficult to titrate the dose to control side effectsand therapeutic effects. There may, however, be circumstances when it is useful to prescribelong-acting medications during acute treatment. For example, if a patient experiences an exac-erbation of psychotic symptoms while receiving long-acting injectable medications, it may beuseful to continue the long-acting injectable medication while temporarily supplementing itwith oral medication (92).
Determining the optimal dose of antipsychotic medication in the acute phase is complicat-
ed by the fact that there is usually a delay between initiation of treatment and full therapeuticresponse. Patients may take between 2 and 4 weeks to show an initial response (93) and up to6 months or longer to show full or optimal response. It is important to select a dose that is botheffective and not likely to cause side effects that are subjectively difficult to tolerate, since theexperience of unpleasant side effects may affect long-term adherence (see Section II.A.3,“Developing a Therapeutic Alliance and Promoting T reatment Adherence”). Some commonearly side effects such as sedation, postural hypotension, acute dystonia, or nausea will typicallyimprove or resolve after the first several days or weeks of treatment, and patients can be encour-aged to tolerate or temporarily manage these short-term effects.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 31akathisia and parkinsonism, are likely to persist with long-term treatment. In general, the op-
timal dose (range) of medication is that which produces maximal therapeutic effects and min-imal side effects. The optimal dose of first-generation antipsychotics (Table 2) is, for mostpatients, at the “EPS threshold,” the dose that will induce extrapyramidal side effects and wherea physical examination of the patient shows minimal rigidity (94). Evidence suggests that dosesabove this threshold increase risk of extrapyramidal and other side effects without enhancingefficacy (95–97). Second-generation antipsychotics can generally be administered at doses thatare therapeutic yet well below the “EPS threshold.” The target dose (Table 2) usually falls with-in the therapeutic dose range specified by the manufacturer and in the package labeling ap-proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In clinical practice, however, dosesof several second-generation drugs, including olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone, have ex-tended above their recommended ranges. In determining the target dose, the psychiatrist shouldconsider the patient’s past history of response and dose needs, clinical condition, and severityof symptoms. Doses should be titrated as quickly as tolerated to the target therapeutic dose(generally sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and tachycardia are the side effects that limit therate of increase), and unless there is evidence that the patient is having uncomfortable side ef-fects, the patient’s clinical status ideally should then be monitored for 2–4 weeks before increas-ing the dose or changing medications. During these weeks it is often important for thephysician to be patient and avoid the temptation to prematurely escalate the dose for patientswho are responding slowly. Rapid escalation can create the false impression of enhanced effica-cy when time is often an important factor, and higher doses may actually be detrimental.
If the patient is not improving, consider whether the lack of response can be explained by
medication nonadherence, rapid medication metabolism, or poor absorption. If the patient hasbeen treated with one of the medications for which there are adequate data on blood level re-lationships with clinical response (e.g., clozapine, haloperidol), determination of the plasmaconcentration may be helpful. If nonadherence is a problem, behavioral tailoring (i.e., fittingtaking medication into one’s daily routine) (30), motivational interviewing, and other psycho-therapeutic techniques may be useful in helping the patient develop an understanding of thepotential benefits of medication (12, 98). In addition, surreptitious nonadherence (i.e., “cheek-ing”) may be addressed by use of a liquid (e.g., risperidone, haloperidol), a quick-dissolvingtablet (e.g., olanzapine, risperidone), or a short-acting intramuscular form (e.g., ziprasidone,haloperidol).
If the patient is adhering to treatment and has an adequate plasma concentration of medi-
cation but is not responding to the treatment, alternative treatments should be considered. Ifthe patient is able to tolerate a higher dose of antipsychotic medication without significant sideeffects, raising the dose for a finite period, such as 2–4 weeks, can be tried, although the incre-mental efficacy of higher doses has not been well established. If dose adjustment does not resultin an adequate response, a different antipsychotic medication should be considered.
4. Use of adjunctive medications in the acute phase
Other psychoactive medications are commonly added to antipsychotic medications in theacute phase to treat comorbid conditions or associated symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression,affective symptoms), to address sleep disturbances, and to treat antipsychotic drug side effects.Therapeutic approaches to treatment resistance and residual symptoms are discussed in SectionII.E, “Special Issues in Caring for Patients With T reatment-Resistant Illness.”
Adjunctive medications are also commonly prescribed for residual symptoms and comorbid
conditions during the acute phase. For example, benzodiazepines may be helpful in treatingcatatonia as well as in managing both anxiety and agitation. The most agitated patients maybenefit from addition of an oral or a parenteral benzodiazepine to the antipsychotic medica-tion. Lorazepam has the advantage of reliable absorption when it is administered either orallyor parenterally (99). There is some evidence that mood stabilizers and beta-blockers may be

32 APA Practice Guidelineseffective in reducing the severity of recurrent hostility and aggression (100–102). Major depres-
sion and obsessive-compulsive disorder are common comorbid conditions in patients with
schizophrenia and may respond to an antidepressant. However, some antidepressants (thosethat inhibit catecholamine reuptake) can potentially sustain or exacerbate psychotic symptomsin some patients (103). Careful attention must be paid to potential drug-drug interactions, es-pecially those related to the cytochrome P450 enzymes (48, 49).
Sleep disturbances are common in the acute phase, and while controlled studies are lacking,
there is anecdotal evidence that a sedating antidepressant (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine) or abenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic may be helpful.
Medications can be used to treat extrapyramidal side effects (Table 5) and other side effects
of antipsychotic medications that are described in detail in Part B, Section V.A.1, “AntipsychoticMedications.” Decisions to use medications to treat side effects are driven by the severity anddegree of distress associated with the side effect and by consideration of other potential strate-gies, including lowering the dose of the antipsychotic medication or switching to a differentantipsychotic medication. The following factors should be considered in decisions regardingthe prophylactic use of antiparkinsonian medications in acute-phase treatment: the propensityof the antipsychotic medication to cause extrapyramidal side effects, the patient’s preferences,the patient’s prior history of extrapyramidal side effects, other risk factors for extrapyramidalside effects (especially dystonia), and risk factors for and potential consequences of anticholin-ergic side effects.
5. Use of ECT and other somatic therapies in the acute phase
ECT in combination with antipsychotic medications may be considered for patients withschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with severe psychotic symptoms that have not respond-ed to treatment with antipsychotic agents. The efficacy of acute treatment with ECT in patientswith schizophrenia has been described in a number of controlled trials as well as in multiple caseseries and uncontrolled studies (106–108). The greatest therapeutic benefits appear to occurwhen ECT is administered concomitantly with antipsychotic medications. The majority ofstudies, including several randomized studies, have shown benefit from ECT combined withfirst-generation antipsychotic agents (109–126). More recent findings also suggest benefit fromcombined treatment with ECT and second-generation antipsychotic medications (127–135).However, given the clear benefits of clozapine in patients with treatment-resistant psychoticsymptoms, a trial of clozapine will generally be indicated before acute treatment with ECT.
Clinical experience, as well as evidence from case series and open prospective trials, suggests
that ECT should also be considered for patients with prominent catatonic features that havenot responded to an acute trial of lorazepam (136–143). For patients with schizophrenia andcomorbid depression, ECT may also be beneficial if depressive symptoms are resistant to treat-TABLE 5. Selected Medications for Treating Extrapyramidal Side Effects

/L50776 C. STABILIZATION PHASE
During the stabilization phase, the aims of treatment are to sustain symptom remission or con-trol, minimize stress on the patient, provide support to minimize the likelihood of relapse, en-hance the patient’s adaptation to life in the community, facilitate the continued reduction insymptoms and consolidation of remission, and promote the process of recovery.
Controlled trials provide relatively little guidance for medication treatment during this
phase. If the patient has achieved an adequate therapeutic response with minimal side effectsor toxicity with a particular medication regimen, he or she should be monitored while takingthe same medication and dose for the next 6 months. Premature lowering of dose or discontin-uation of medication during this phase may lead to a relatively rapid relapse. However, it is alsocritical to assess continuing side effects that may have been present in the acute phase and toadjust pharmacotherapy accordingly to minimize adverse side effects that may otherwise leadto medication nonadherence and relapse. Moreover, any adjunctive medications that have beenused in the acute phase should be evaluated for continuation.
Psychotherapeutic interventions remain supportive but may be less structured and directive
than in the acute phase. Education about the course and outcome of the illness and about fac-tors that influence the course and outcome, including treatment adherence, can begin in thisphase for patients and continue for family members. Educational programs during this phasehave been effective in teaching a wide range of patients with schizophrenia the skills of medi-cation self-management (e.g., the benefits of maintenance antipsychotic medication, how tocope with side effects) and symptom self-management (e.g., how to identify early warning signsof relapse, develop a relapse prevention plan, and refuse illicit drugs and alcohol), as well asstrategies for interacting with health care providers (149–152).
It is important that there be no gaps in service delivery, because patients are vulnerable to
relapse and need support in adjusting to community life. Not uncommonly, problems in con-tinuity of care arise when patients are discharged from hospitals to community care. It is im-perative to arrange for linkage of services between hospital and community treatment beforethe patient is discharged from the hospital. Short lengths of hospital stay create challenges foradequately linking inpatient to outpatient care, but to the extent possible, patients should haveinput into selecting their postdischarge follow-up residential and treatment plans. It is fre-quently beneficial to arrange an appointment with an outpatient psychiatrist and, for patientswho will reside in a community residence, to arrange a visit before discharge (153, 154). Afterdischarge, patients should be helped to adjust to life in the community through realistic goalsetting without undue pressure to perform at high levels vocationally and socially, since undulyambitious expectations on the part of therapists (20), family members (155), or others, as wellas an overly stimulating treatment environment (156), can be stressful to patients and can in-crease the risk of relapse. These principles also apply in the stable phase. Efforts should be madeto actively involve family members in the treatment process. Other psychosocial treatments,

34 APA Practice Guidelinesdiscussed below in Section II.D, “Stable Phase,” may be initiated during this phase depending
on the patient’s level of recovery and motivation. While it is critical not to place premature de-mands on the patient regarding engagement in community-based activities and rehabilitationservices, it is equally critical to maintain a level of momentum aimed at improving communityfunctioning in order to instill a sense of hope and progress for the patient and family. Theseefforts set the stage for continuing treatments during the stable phase.
/L50776 D. STABLE PHASE
Treatment during the stable phase is designed to sustain symptom remission or control, mini-mize the risk and consequences of relapse, and optimize functioning and the process of recovery.
1. Assessment in the stable phase
Ongoing monitoring and assessment during the stable phase are necessary to determine wheth-er the patient might benefit from alterations in the treatment program. Ongoing assessmentallows patients and those who interact with them to describe any changes in symptoms or func-tioning and raise questions about specific symptoms and side effects.
Monitoring for adverse effects should be done regularly (T able 1). Clinicians should inquire
about the course of any side effects that developed in the acute or stabilization phases (e.g., sexualside effects, sedation). Monitoring for other potential adverse effects should be guided by theparticular medications chosen (see Part B, Section V.A.1, “Antipsychotic Medications”).
If the patient agrees, it is helpful to maintain strong ties with persons who interact with the
patient frequently and would therefore be most likely to notice any resurgence of symptomsand the occurrence of life stresses and events that may increase the risk of relapse or impedecontinuing functional recovery. However, the frequency of assessments by the psychiatrist orother members of the treatment team depends on the specific nature of the treatment and ex-pected fluctuations of the illness. Frequency of contacts may range from every few weeks forpatients who are doing well and are stabilized to as often as every day for those who are goingthrough highly stressful changes in their lives.
2. Psychosocial treatments in the stable phase
For most persons with schizophrenia in the stable phase, treatment programs that combinemedications with a range of psychosocial services are associated with improved outcomes.Knowledge and research regarding how best to combine treatments to optimize outcome arescarce. Nonetheless, provision of such packages of services likely reduces the need for crisis-oriented care hospitalizations and emergency department visits and enables greater recovery.
A number of psychosocial treatments have demonstrated effectiveness. These treatments in-
clude family interventions (31, 157, 158), supported employment (159–162), assertive commu-nity treatment (163–166), social skills training (167–169), and cognitive behaviorally orientedpsychotherapy (158, 170). An evidence-based practices project sponsored by the Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is developing resource kits on family in-terventions, assertive community treatment, and supported employment (draft versions availableat http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/fpe_pcs.pdf; http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/act_c.pdf; http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/se_mhpl.pdf).
In the same way that psychopharmacological management must be individually tailored to
the needs and preferences of the patient, so too should the selection of psychosocial treatments.The selection of appropriate and effective psychosocial treatments needs to be driven by thecircumstances of the individual patient’s needs and his or her social context. At the very least,all persons with schizophrenia should be provided with education about their illness. Beyondneeding illness education, most patients will also benefit from at least some of the recommendedpsychosocial interventions. However, since patients’ clinical and social needs will vary at differ-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 35ent points in their illness course and since some psychosocial treatments share treatment com-
ponents, it would be rare for all of these psychosocial interventions to be utilized during anyone phase of illness for an individual patient.
a) Prevention of relapse and reduction of symptom severity
A major goal during the stable phase is to prevent relapse and reduce the severity of residual symp-toms. Certain psychosocial interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in this regard. They in-clude family education and support, assertive community treatment, and cognitive therapy.
Interventions that educate families about schizophrenia, provide support, and offer training
in effective problem solving and communication have been subjected to numerous randomizedclinical trials (171, 172). The data strongly and consistently support the value of such inter-ventions in reducing symptom relapse, and there is some evidence that these interventions con-tribute to improved patient functioning and family well-being. Randomized clinical trials havereported 2-year relapse rates for patients receiving family “psychoeducation” programs in com-bination with medication that are 50% lower than those for patients receiving medicationalone (173–180). Further, a recent study found psychoeducational programs using multiplefamily groups to be more effective and less expensive than individual family psychoeducationalinterventions for Caucasians, though not for African Americans (178). On the basis of the evi-dence, persons with schizophrenia and their families who have ongoing contact with each othershould be offered a family intervention, the key elements of which include a duration of at least9 months, illness education, crisis intervention, emotional support, and training in how tocope with illness symptoms and related problems.
PACT is a specific model of community-based care. Its origin is an experiment in Madison,
Wisconsin, in the 1970s in which the multidisciplinary inpatient team of the state hospital wasmoved into the community (181, 182) . The team took with it all of the functions of an inpa-
tient team: interdisciplinary teamwork, 24-hour/7-days-per-week coverage, comprehensive treat-ment planning, ongoing responsibility, staff continuity, and small caseloads. PACT is designed totreat patients who are at high risk for hospital readmission and who cannot be maintained bymore usual community-based treatment as well as for patients with severe psychosocial impair-ment who need extensive assistance to live in the community. Randomized trials comparingPACT to other community-based care have consistently shown that PACT substantially reducesutilization of inpatient services and promotes continuity of outpatient care (183, 184). Patients’satisfaction with this model is generally high, and family advocacy groups, such as NAMI in theUnited States, strongly support its use and dissemination.
Results are less consistent regarding the effect of PACT on other outcomes, although at least
some studies have shown enhancement of clinical status, functioning, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness studies support its value in the treatment of high-risk patients. Studies also indi-cate that a particular PACT program’s effectiveness is related to the fidelity with which it is im-plemented, that is, the degree to which the program adheres to the original PACT model.
Controlled studies of cognitive behavior psychotherapy have reported benefits in reducing the
severity of persistent psychotic symptoms (170). Most of the studies have been performed with in-dividual cognitive behavior therapy of at least several months’ duration; in some studies, groupcognitive behavior therapy and/or therapy of a shorter duration has been used. In all of the studiesclinicians who provided cognitive behavior therapy received specialized training in the approach.In addition, the key elements of this intervention include a shared understanding of the illness be-tween the patient and therapist, identification of target symptoms, and the development of specificcognitive and behavioral strategies to cope with these symptoms. Therefore, based on the availableevidence, persons with schizophrenia who have residual psychotic symptoms while receiving ade-quate pharmacotherapy may benefit from cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy.
A variety of other approaches to counseling individual patients to help them cope better
with their illness are used, although research in this area remains limited. In general, counseling

36 APA Practice Guidelinesthat emphasizes illness education, support, and problem solving is most appropriate. A notable
prototype of this approach is personal therapy, as developed by Hogarty and colleagues (185–187). Personal therapy is an individualized long-term psychosocial intervention provided to pa-tients on a weekly to biweekly frequency within the larger framework of a treatment programthat provides pharmacotherapy, family work (when a family is available), and multiple levels ofsupport, both material and psychological. The approach is carefully tailored to the patient’sphase of recovery from an acute episode and the patient’s residual level of severity, disability,and vulnerability to relapse.
b) Negative symptoms
During the stable phase, negative symptoms (e.g., affective flattening, alogia, avolition) may beprimary and represent a core feature of schizophrenia, or they may be secondary to psychoticsymptoms, a depressive syndrome, medication side effects (e.g., dysphoria), or environmentaldeprivation. The effectiveness of psychosocial treatments for reducing negative symptoms isnot well studied. Furthermore, most research (for both psychosocial and pharmacological treat-ments) does not distinguish between primary and secondary negative symptoms. Thus, the ge-neric term “negative symptoms” is used to summarize these findings. Some studies of cognitivebehavior therapy report improvements in residual negative symptoms. In a review of threestudies, Rector and Beck (188) reported a large aggregated effect size favoring cognitive behav-ior therapy over supportive therapy for reducing negative symptoms. Also, one study of familypsychoeducation reported an improvement in negative symptoms with this intervention (189).
c) Improving functional status and quality of life
A primary treatment goal during the stable phase is to enable the patient to continue the recov-ery process and to achieve the goals of improved functioning and quality of life. To the degreeto which active positive symptoms impair functional capacity, medications that reduce positivesymptoms may improve functioning. However, research indicates consistently that positivesymptoms show a low correspondence with functional impairments among patients withschizophrenia (190). Rather, it is the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments that aremore predictive of functional impairment (191). Because available medications have at bestonly modest effects on these illness dimensions, it is not surprising that there is scant evidencethat medications improve functional status beyond that achieved through reduction of impair-ing positive symptoms. Consequently, certain psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions areessential to consider in the stable phase to enhance functional status.
Supported employment is an approach to improve vocational functioning among persons
with various types of disabilities, including schizophrenia (192). The evidence-based supportedemployment programs that have been found effective include the key elements of individual-ized job development, rapid placement emphasizing competitive employment, ongoing jobsupports, and integration of vocational and mental health services. Randomized trials haveconsistently demonstrated the effectiveness of supported employment in helping persons withschizophrenia to achieve competitive employment (193, 194). Employment outcomes relatedto the duration of employment and to the amount of earnings also favor supported employ-ment over traditional vocational services. Further, there is no evidence that engagement in sup-ported employment leads to stress, increased symptoms, or other negative outcome (159).Evidence is inconsistent about the relationship between clinical and demographic variables andsuccessful vocational performance; therefore, it is recommended that any person with schizo-phrenia who expresses an interest in work should be offered supported employment. Promot-ing job retention is a continuing challenge even for supported employment. Studies have foundthat persons with schizophrenia experience considerable difficulties retaining jobs achievedthrough supported employment (162, 194). This problem appears to be related to neurocogni-tive impairments (195), among other factors.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 37Social skills training has been found helpful in addressing functional impairments in social
skills or activities of daily living. The key elements of this intervention include behaviorally
based instruction, modeling, corrective feedback, and contingent social reinforcement. Clinic-
based skills training should be supplemented with practice and training in the patient’s day-to-day environment. The results of controlled trials indicate the benefit of skills training in im-proving illness knowledge, social skills, and symptom and medication management when of-fered with adequate pharmacotherapy (167). Evidence is strongest for the benefit of skillstraining in increasing the acquisition of skills assessed by situationally specific measures.
d) Patient and self-help treatment organizations
Peer support is social-emotional and sometimes instrumental support that is mutually offeredor provided by persons having a mental health condition, i.e., mental health consumers, to oth-ers sharing a similar mental health condition to bring about a desired social or personal change(196). The oldest and most widely available type of peer support is self-help groups. Basedlargely on uncontrolled studies of self-help groups for persons with severe mental illness,Davidson et al. (197) concluded that self-help groups seem to improve symptoms and increaseparticipants’ social networks and quality of life. Additional studies of self-help groups havedemonstrated other positive outcomes, including reductions in hospitalizations, improvedcoping, greater acceptance of the illness, improved medication adherence and illness manage-ment, improved daily functioning, lower levels of worry , and higher satisfaction with health(198–200, unpublished 1989 manuscript of M. Kennedy).
Within the realm of consumer-provided or -delivered services are consumer-run or -operated
services, consumer partnership services, and consumer employees. Consumer-run or -operatedservices are services that are planned, operated, administered, and evaluated by consumers (201,202). Those service programs that are not freestanding legal entities but share control of the op-eration of the program with nonconsumers are categorized as consumer partnerships. Consumeremployees are persons who fill positions designated for consumers as well as consumers who arehired into traditional mental health positions. Reviews of peer support/consumer-provided ser-vices specifically for persons with severe mental illness have generated positive results, but thefindings are somewhat tentative, given the infancy of the research area (197, 203, 204). Suchservices have been associated with reduced hospitalizations, reduced use of crisis services, im-proved social functioning, reduced substance use, and improved quality of life (205–209).
3. Use of antipsychotic medications in the stable phase
Once a patient reaches the stable or maintenance phase of treatment, it is important for thephysician to develop a long-term treatment management plan that minimizes the risk of re-lapse, monitors for and minimizes the severity of side effects, and to the extent possible address-es residual symptoms.
Antipsychotics can reduce the risk of relapse in the stable phase of illness to less than 30%
per year (210–215). Without maintenance treatment, 60%–70% of patients relapse within 1 year,and almost 90% relapse within 2 years. Strategies can be used to increase the likelihood that pa-tients will adhere to prescribed medication regimens. Such strategies are described in Section II.A.3, “Developing a Therapeutic Alliance and Promoting Treatment Adherence.”
Deciding on the dose of an antipsychotic medication during the stable phase is complicated
by the fact that there is no reliable strategy available to identify the minimum effective dose toprevent relapse. Although higher doses are often more effective at reducing relapse risk thanlower doses, higher doses often cause greater side effects and lessen subjective tolerability; there-fore, clinicians should attempt to treat at a dose that minimizes side effects but is still in theeffective range of a particular drug (refer to Table 2). For most patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics, clinicians should use a dose around the “EPS threshold” (94), sincestudies indicate that higher doses are usually not more efficacious and increase risk of subjec-

38 APA Practice Guidelinestively intolerable side effects (95–97). Lower doses of first-generation antipsychotic medica-
tions may be associated with improved adherence and better subjective state and perhapsultimately better functioning. Second-generation antipsychotics can generally be administeredat doses that are therapeutic but will not induce extrapyramidal side effects. The advantages ofdecreasing antipsychotics to the “minimal effective dose” should be weighed against a somewhatgreater risk of relapse and more frequent exacerbations of schizophrenic symptoms (216). Re-cent evidence suggests potentially greater efficacy in relapse prevention for the second-genera-tion antipsychotic drugs (215, 217); however, whether this result is due to better efficacy or someother factor such as greater treatment adherence or reduced side effects is unclear.
The available antipsychotics are associated with differential risk of a variety of adverse ef-
fects, including neurological, metabolic, sexual, endocrine, sedative, and cardiovascular effects(Table 4). A suggested approach to monitoring of side effects is detailed in Table 1 and shouldbe based on the side effect profile of the prescribed antipsychotic as detailed in Part B, SectionV .A.1, “Antipsychotic Medications.”
Antipsychotic treatment often results in substantial improvement or even remission of pos-
itive symptoms. However, most patients remain functionally impaired because of negativesymptoms, cognitive deficits, and impaired social function. It is important to evaluate whetherresidual negative symptoms are in fact secondary to a parkinsonian syndrome or an untreatedmajor depressive syndrome, since interventions are available to address these negative symp-toms. There are few proven treatment options for residual positive symptoms, primary negativesymptoms, cognitive deficits, or social impairments (see Section II.E, “Special Issues in Caringfor Patients With T reatment-Resistant Illness”).
Most patients who develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (schizoaffective dis-
order and schizophreniform disorder) are at very high risk of relapse in the absence of antipsy-chotic treatment. Emerging evidence suggests this may even be true for first-episode patients;some studies (46, 218) have shown that more than 80% of such patients who do not receiveantipsychotic treatment experience some recurrence of symptoms in the 5 years after remission.Unfortunately, there is no reliable indicator to differentiate the minority who will not relapsefrom the majority who will relapse. Antipsychotics are highly effective in the prevention of re-lapse in remitted first-episode patients. One-year relapse risk varies from 0% to 46% of patientswho are prescribed antipsychotics (210–213). Adherence to maintenance antipsychotic medica-tion likely has an influence on effectiveness and may contribute to varying relapse rates. Themost prudent treatment options that clinicians may discuss with remitted first- or multi-episodepatients include either 1) indefinite antipsychotic maintenance medication or 2) medication dis-continuation (after at least 1 year of symptom remission or optimal response while taking med-ication) with close follow-up and with a plan to reinstitute antipsychotic treatment on symptomrecurrence. However, evidence indicates that sustained treatment is associated with fewer relaps-es than is targeted intermittent treatment (219). In addition, intermittent treatment strategiesappear to increase rather than decrease the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Clinicians should engagepatients in a discussion of the long-term potential risks of maintenance treatment with the pre-scribed antipsychotic (see Part B, Section V.A.1, “Antipsychotic Medications”) versus the risksof relapse (e.g., the effect of relapse on social and vocational functioning, the risk of dangerousbehaviors with relapse, and the risk of developing chronic treatment-resistant symptoms). If adecision is made to discontinue antipsychotic medication, the discontinuation should be grad-ual (e.g., reducing the dose by 10% per month). Additional precautions should be taken to min-imize the risk of a psychotic relapse. The physician should educate the patient and the familyabout early signs of relapse, advise them to develop plans for action should these signs appear,and suggest that the patient continue to be seen by a physician on a regular basis.
Indefinite maintenance antipsychotic medication is recommended for patients who have had
multiple prior episodes or two episodes within 5 years. Patients taking antipsychotic medicationshould also be monitored for signs and symptoms of impending or actual relapse, since even in

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 39adherent patients the risk of relapse in chronic schizophrenia is about 30% per year. The treat-
ment program should be organized to respond quickly when a patient, family member, or friendreports any symptoms that could indicate an impending or actual relapse. Early intervention us-ing supportive therapeutic techniques and increasing medication as indicated can be very helpfulin reducing the likelihood of relapse and hospitalization (220). During prodromal episodes, pa-tients and family members should be seen more frequently for treatment, monitoring, and sup-port, and assertive outreach, including home visits, should be used when indicated.
4. Use of adjunctive medications in the stable phase
Other psychoactive medications are commonly added to antipsychotic medications in the stablephase to treat comorbid conditions, aggression, anxiety, or other mood symptoms; to augmentthe antipsychotic effects of the primary drug; and to treat side effects. Other medications thatmay address treatment-resistant and residual psychotic symptoms are discussed in Section II.E,“Special Issues in Caring for Patients With T reatment-Resistant Illness.”
Adjunctive medications are commonly prescribed for comorbid conditions. For example,
major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are common comorbid conditions in pa-tients with schizophrenia and may respond to antidepressant medications (221–223). However,some antidepressants (those that inhibit catecholamine reuptake) can potentially sustain or ex-acerbate psychotic symptoms in some patients (103). Benzodiazepines may be helpful for man-aging anxiety during the stable phase of treatment (224), although risk of dependence andabuse exists with chronic use of this class of medication. There is some evidence that mood sta-bilizers and beta-blockers (100–102) may be effective in reducing the severity of recurrent hos-tility and aggression. Mood stabilizers may also address prominent mood lability. As mentionedpreviously, attention must be given to potential drug interactions, especially related to metab-olism by the cytochrome P450 enzymes (48, 49).
Patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics may require the long-term use of med-
ications for treatment of extrapyramidal side effects (Table 5). Although the study findings arenot consistent, there is some evidence that vitamin E may reduce the risk of development oftardive dyskinesia (225, 226). Given the low risk of side effects associated with vitamin E, pa-tients may be advised to take 400–800 I.U. daily as prophylaxis.
Many other medications may be used to treat or reduce the risk of various antipsychotic side
effects. These medications are discussed with each specific antipsychotic in Part B, Section V.A.1,“Antipsychotic Medications.”
5. Use of ECT in the stable phase
Clinical observations (227, 228) and a single randomized clinical trial (229) suggest that main-tenance ECT may be helpful for some patients who have responded to acute treatment withECT but for whom pharmacological prophylaxis alone has been ineffective or cannot be toler-ated. The frequency of treatments varies from patient to patient and depends on the degree ofclinical response and side effects of treatment (107). As with acute treatment with ECT , avail-able evidence suggests that treatment with antipsychotics should continue during the mainte-nance ECT course (229).
/L50776 E. SPECIAL ISSUES IN CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH 
TREATMENT-RESISTANT ILLNESS
About 10%–30% of patients have little or no response to antipsychotic medications, and up toan additional 30% of patients have partial responses to treatment, meaning that they exhibit im-provement in psychopathology but continue to have mild to severe residual hallucinations or de-

40 APA Practice Guidelineslusions. Even if a patient’s positive symptoms respond or remit with antipsychotic treatment,
other residual symptoms, including negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often persist.Treatment resistance is defined as little or no symptomatic response to multiple (at least two)antipsychotic trials of an adequate duration (at least 6 weeks) and dose (therapeutic range).
T reatment may be completely or partially unsuccessful for a variety of reasons. The patient
may receive a suboptimal dose of antipsychotic, either because an inadequate dose has beenprescribed or because the patient does not take some or all of the prescribed antipsychotic. Theprescribed antipsychotic may be partially or fully ineffective in treating acute symptoms or inpreventing relapse. Substance use may also cause or contribute to treatment resistance.
In assessing treatment resistance, clinicians should carefully evaluate whether the patient has
had an adequate trial of an antipsychotic, including whether the dose is adequate and whetherthe patient has been taking the medication as prescribed. Strategies for improving adherenceare described in Section II.A.3, “Developing a Therapeutic Alliance and Promoting T reatmentAdherence.”
Even when patients are taking antipsychotics, suboptimal treatment response and residual
symptoms are common. There are considerable differences between patients in responsivenessto available antipsychotics. However, currently there is no reliable strategy to predict responseor risk of side effects with one agent compared with another. Thus, adequate trials of multipleantipsychotics are often needed before antipsychotic treatment is optimized. Complicating theevaluation of treatment response is the fact that there is some time delay between initiation oftreatment and full clinical response. An initial trial of 2–4 weeks generally is needed to determineif the patient will have any symptomatic response, and symptoms can continue to improve for upto 6 months (230, 231).
Because of clozapine’s superior efficacy, a trial of clozapine should be considered for a patient
with a clinically inadequate response to antipsychotic treatment or for a patient with suicidalideation or behavior (55). Besides clozapine, there are limited options for the many patientswho have severe and significant residual symptoms even after antipsychotic monotherapy hasbeen optimized, and none have proven benefits. Various augmentation strategies that have lim-ited or no evidence supporting their efficacy are often used. However, clinicians may considera time-limited trial of an agent to determine if it offers any benefit to an individual patient. Toavoid risking side effects and potential drug interactions, it is important that the actual efficacyof adjunctive medications is carefully evaluated and that adjunctive medications that do notproduce clinical benefits are discontinued. Depending on the type of residual symptom (e.g.,positive, negative, cognitive, or mood symptoms; aggressive behavior), augmentation strategiesinclude adding another antipsychotic (232–234), anticonvulsants (102, 235–237), benzodiaz-epines (224), N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor allosteric agonists (e.g., D-serine [238],
glycine [239–242], D-cycloserine [243–246]), and cholinergic agonists (247–249). ECT has
demonstrated benefits in patients with treatment-resistant symptoms (106–108). Cognitivebehavior therapy techniques may have value in improving positive symptoms with low risk ofside effects (98). In addition, cognitive remediation is under investigation as a therapeutic strat-egy to reduce the severity of cognitive deficits (250).

1. Psychiatric features
a) First episodeActive psychosis is dangerous to a person’s safety; disrupts capacity to function, life, and repu-tation; and if persistent for too long can negatively affect prognosis (251). In contrast, earlytreatment may result in a significant reduction in morbidity and better quality of life for pa-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 41tients and families (252–256). Approximately 25 studies have examined this phenomenon;
about two-thirds have shown a significant association between earlier treatment and better out-come on one or more measures, and none has shown a significant association between delayedtreatment and better outcome on any measure (257). Despite the benefits of early treatment,there is usually a delay of 1–2 years between the onset of psychotic symptoms and the time thepatient first receives adequate psychiatric treatment (252, 258–261). Thus, once psychosis isevident, it should be treated immediately.
In some persons, particularly those with a family history of schizophrenia or other factors in-
fluencing risk, prodromal symptoms may be apparent before the development of a full schizo-phrenia syndrome. Although empirical evidence on long-term outcome is limited, antipsychoticmedication treatment may also be helpful in some persons with prodromal symptoms (262–264).
When a patient presents with a first episode of psychosis, close observation and documen-
tation of the signs and symptoms over time are important because initial psychotic episodes canbe polymorphic and evolve into a variety of specific disorders (e.g., schizophreniform disorder,bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder). There is controversy over whether first-episode patientsshould be treated as outpatients or in the hospital. Inpatient care offers both risks and protections.On the one hand, the experience of a first psychiatric hospitalization, especially in a closed set-ting with many chronically ill patients, can be frightening and produce its own trauma (265).On the other hand, the nature and severity of a first episode are often unknown, unpredictable,and require more than “usual” surveillance. A hospital setting also allows for careful monitoringof the psychotic symptoms as well as any side effects, including acute dystonia, akathisia, orneuroleptic malignant syndrome (266), that may arise from treatment with antipsychotic med-ications.
Patients with first-episode psychosis are comparatively more treatment responsive than pa-
tients with multiple episodes of psychosis but, at the same time, are quite sensitive to side ef-fects (267–270). Up to the early 1990s, drug treatment for a first episode of psychosis waslimited to first-generation antipsychotic medications that could cause severe sedation and ex-trapyramidal side effects. The second-generation antipsychotic medications have less propen-sity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, and patients are hence less likely to need concomitantanticholinergic agents (271–273).
More than 70% of first-episode patients achieve a full remission of psychotic signs and symp-
toms within 3–4 months, with 83% achieving stable remission at the end of 1 year (274). Stud-ies also reveal that first-episode patients often respond to low doses of antipsychotic medications(275–279). However, predictors of poor treatment response include male gender, pre- or perin-atal injury, more severe hallucinations and delusions, attentional impairments, poor premorbidfunction, longer duration of untreated psychosis (280), the development of extrapyramidal sideeffects (281), and high levels of expressed emotion in the patient’s family (282–289).
Not uncommonly, symptoms of schizophrenia have their onset before adulthood, and as-
pects of treatment may differ in children and adolescents. For more information on treatingchildren and adolescents, readers are referred to the American Academy of Child and Adoles-cent Psychiatry’s Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents
With Schizophrenia  (290).
Once remission of psychotic symptoms is achieved, a high priority should be placed on min-
imizing risk of relapse, given its potential clinical, social, and vocational costs. In particular, re-current episodes are associated with increasing risk of chronic residual symptoms and evidenceof anatomical neuroprogression (257, 280, 291–293). Patients, their families, and treating cli-nicians often hope that symptom remission indicates that the disease will not become chronic,although this is true only for a minority (about 10%–20%) of patients (46, 218, 294). Thus,clinicians should candidly discuss the high risk of relapse and factors that may minimize relapserisk. Although there is very little study of factors that act to maintain recovery in remitted first-episode patients, evidence suggests that antipsychotics are highly effective in prevention of re-

42 APA Practice Guidelineslapse. In patients for whom antipsychotics are prescribed, 1-year relapse risk varies from 0% to
46%, with relapse rates of patients who discontinue taking medication being up to five timeshigher than rates for those who continue treatment (46, 210–213). Since adherence to main-tenance medication treatment likely influences effectiveness, it may contribute to the varyingrelapse rates found in these studies.
In arriving at a plan of treatment with remitted first-episode patients, clinicians should en-
gage patients in discussion of the long-term potential risks of maintenance treatment with theprescribed antipsychotic versus risks of relapse (e.g., effect of relapse on social and vocationalfunction, risk of dangerous behaviors with relapse, and risk of developing chronic treatment-resistant symptoms). Prudent treatment options that clinicians may discuss with remitted pa-tients include either 1) indefinite antipsychotic maintenance medication (295) or 2) medica-tion discontinuation with close follow-up and a plan of antipsychotic reinstitution withsymptom recurrence. Medications should never be stopped abruptly, as rebound psychosis mayresult and may be misinterpreted as a reoccurrence. In addition to maintenance antipsychoticmedication, other potential strategies to maintain recovery in remitted first-episode patientsinclude enhancing stress management and eliminating exposure to cannabinoids and psycho-stimulants (296).
b) Subtypes and deficit symptoms
According to DSM-IV-TR, the classic subtypes of schizophrenia are paranoid, disorganized,catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual. There are at present no treatment strategies specificto the various subtypes, with the exception of the use of benzodiazepines for catatonia. The def-icit/nondeficit categorization, or the deficit syndrome, is also important to recognize, althoughthere are also no specific treatments (297). The negative symptoms of schizophrenia may beclassified as primary or secondary. Negative symptoms may be primary and represent a core fea-ture of schizophrenia, or they may be secondary to positive psychotic symptoms (e.g., paranoidwithdrawal), medication side effects (e.g., dysphoria), depressive symptoms (e.g., anhedonia),anxiety symptoms (e.g., social phobia), demoralization, or environmental deprivation (e.g., inchronic institutionalization). Deficit schizophrenia is heavily loaded with enduring primary neg-ative symptoms such as affective flattening, alogia, and avolition.
The prevalence of deficit states in first-episode schizophrenia has been estimated to be between
4% and 10% (298). Negative symptoms are already present in the prodromal phase (299–301),and the prevalence increases with the length of the schizophrenic illness (302–306). Male pa-tients have been found to experience more negative symptoms than female patients (307–309).Patients with deficit schizophrenia are also found to have poorer premorbid adjustment duringchildhood and early adolescence. They exhibit more impairment in general cognitive abilitiesand have problems in sequencing of complex motor acts, which suggests frontoparietal dysfunc-tion (310).
T reatment of negative symptoms begins with assessing the patient for factors that can cause
the appearance of secondary negative symptoms (311). The treatment of such secondary nega-tive symptoms consists of treating their cause, e.g., antipsychotics for primary positive symp-toms, antidepressants for depression, anxiolytics for anxiety disorders, or antiparkinsonian agentsor antipsychotic dose reduction for extrapyramidal side effects. If negative symptoms persist aftersuch treatment, they are presumed to be primary negative symptoms of the deficit state (312).
There are no treatments with proven efficacy for primary negative symptoms. Clozapine
was reported to be effective for negative symptoms in earlier short-term trials (313), but sub-sequent longer-term studies challenged such claims (314, 315), although clozapine treatmentwas associated with significant improvement in social and occupational functioning (314). Thesecond-generation antipsychotic medications have been reported to be useful against negativesymptoms (316–322), but this improvement may be accounted for by their having less pro-pensity to cause extrapyramidal side effects (323).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 43c) Substance use disorders
More than one-third of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders also have a substanceuse disorder, and people with schizophrenia show six times the risk of developing a substanceuse disorder than do persons in the general population (324). Other research finds that be-tween 20% and 65% of people with schizophrenia experience comorbid substance use dis-orders (325–328). A recent Australian study found the 6-month and lifetime prevalence ofsubstance abuse or dependence among people with schizophrenia to be 26.8% and 59.8%, re-spectively (329).
Substance abuse in schizophrenia has been associated with male gender, single marital sta-
tus, less education, earlier age at onset of schizophrenia and at first hospital admission, frequentand longer periods of hospitalization, more pronounced psychotic symptoms, more severe ce-rebral gray matter volume deficits, and negative consequences such as poor treatment adher-ence, depressive symptoms, suicide, violence, legal problems, incarceration, severe financialproblems, family burden, housing instability, and increased risk of HIV infection (327, 330–332) and hepatitis infection, particularly hepatitis C infection (333). Substance abuse has beenassociated with precipitation of schizophrenia at an earlier age (334–340), and in some studiesamphetamine abuse has been associated with an earlier age of onset (341). Alcohol and a varietyof other substances have also been associated with symptom relapses in schizophrenia (342).Nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine have been found to be the most commonly abusedsubstances. Patients may also abuse prescribed medications such as benzodiazepines and anti-parkinsonian agents.
The goals of treatment for patients with schizophrenia who also have a substance use disor-
der are the same as those for treatment of schizophrenia without comorbidity but with the ad-dition of the goals for treatment of substance use disorders, e.g., harm reduction, abstinence,relapse prevention, and rehabilitation (343).
Evaluation of the patient with schizophrenia should always include a comprehensive inquiry
into possible substance use. Self-report is often unreliable; corroborating evidence from allsources such as family members, friends, community-based case managers, and treatment per-sonnel should be sought (330, 344). Screening instruments for substance use disorders devel-oped for the general population, such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test(AUDIT) (345), can be used, but screening instruments specifically for patients with severemental illnesses, such as the Dartmouth Assessment of Lifestyle Instrument (346), have beendeveloped and may have greater sensitivity for detecting substance use disorders in people withschizophrenia. Laboratory investigations such as urine and blood toxicology for abused sub-stances and liver function tests should be carried out. Many patients with schizophrenia do notdevelop the full physiological dependence syndrome associated with dependence on alcohol orother substances (330). However, even use of low levels of alcohol or other substances by pa-tients with schizophrenia can have untoward consequences. Psychiatrists should therefore at-tend carefully to the presence of alcohol or other substance use and be familiar with thepotential negative consequences described earlier. The rates of current substance use will likelybe higher in acute settings such as the emergency department, and thus the index of suspicionand effort devoted to assessment of substance use should be especially high in such settings.
T raditionally, patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance use disorders were treat-
ed in separate programs, either sequentially or in parallel, for the two types of disorder. Sincethe mid-1980s, a comprehensive integrated treatment model has been adopted to provide con-tinuous outpatient treatment interventions and support over long periods of time (months toyears), enabling patients to acquire the skills they need to manage both illnesses and to pursuefunctional goals. In this model, the same clinicians or teams of clinicians provide treatmentboth for substance use disorders and for other mental disorders. This form of treatment featuresassertive outreach, case management, family interventions, housing, rehabilitation, and phar-macotherapy. It also includes a stage-wise motivational approach for patients who do not rec-ognize the need for treatment of substance use disorders and behavioral interventions for those

44 APA Practice Guidelineswho are trying to attain or maintain abstinence. The interventions have been associated with re-
duced substance use and attainment of remission (347–350).
Initially, many patients need interventions to build motivation rather than to achieve absti-
nence. Special efforts are made to help them recognize that their substance use is interferingwith their ability to pursue personal goals and to nurture their desire to reduce and eliminatetheir substance use (161, 349). Such efforts represent examples of interventions during the sec-ond (persuasion) stage in a four-stage dual-diagnosis treatment model based on readiness forchange; the other treatment stages are engagement, active treatment, and relapse prevention(351). Studies show that treatment programs with these characteristics can be effective in re-ducing substance use and in decreasing the frequency and severity of psychotic decompensations(332, 352–354). Collaboration with family members is often helpful for both the patients andthe family members (64, 171, 355, 356).
In practice, treatment of substance use disorders is commonly conducted by means of a
group therapy approach, usually after patients have achieved stabilization of their schizophren-ic symptoms. The therapeutic approach should be an integrated one that takes into accountpatients’ cognitive deficits and limited tolerance for stress. Generally, groups should emphasizesupport, psychoeducation, and skills training (344, 352, 357). The length and frequency ofgroup sessions should be regulated according to the attention span and interactive tolerance ofthe patients. Therapists should be active in keeping the group structured and focused andshould limit the amount of stress by avoiding the direct confrontation of patients that is com-mon to traditional treatment programs for persons with substance use disorders. Patientsshould understand that they have two complex chronic disorders that together lead to a poorerprognosis than each would have separately. Patients who have not yet attained complete absti-nence should be accepted into treatment, with abstinence as a treatment goal (344, 352, 358).Patients who do not view abstinence as a treatment goal may still be successfully engaged intreatment that is aimed at achieving abstinence (359). Community-based self-help and supportgroups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous can be important in the re-covery of patients with substance use disorders. Such connections are, however, more effectiveonce patients are actively pursuing abstinence (349).
Antipsychotic medications remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for patients
with comorbid substance use disorders. They are used in the usual doses, but patients shouldbe informed that side effects such as sedation and incoordination can be aggravated when com-bining antipsychotic medication with alcohol or other substances. First-generation antipsy-chotic medications and clozapine also have the potential to lower the seizure threshold andinfrequently may precipitate seizures during alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Dysphoriaassociated with first-generation antipsychotic medications may precipitate or worsen the sub-stance use (360). On the other hand, studies have demonstrated that clozapine use is associatedwith reductions in the use of nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine (361–363). In some clin-ical trials, second-generation antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine have also beenshown to be effective for reducing craving in cocaine dependence (364).
There is suggestive evidence from a case series of 30 patients with schizophrenia and other
severe mental illnesses and alcoholism that disulfiram in moderate doses can be used safely andis associated with clinical benefits in alcohol outcomes over 1–3 years (365). However, for pa-tients with schizophrenia who abuse alcohol, disulfiram may pose some risk since it can pre-cipitate psychosis at high doses (358, 366). It also has harmful physical effects when taken withalcohol, and thus it is recommended only for patients who are motivated and who have previ-ously shown good judgment, treatment adherence, and reality testing.
d) Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms are common in all phases of schizophrenia (367). The proportion of pa-tients with schizophrenia who also manifest depression ranges from 7% to 75% (368). Depres-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 45sion may occur in the prodromal phase (300, 301), in the first episode (369–371), during the
early course (372, 373), and after remission, and it may be superimposed on the symptoms ofresidual schizophrenia (“postpsychotic depression”) (374) or may occur in a prodrome to a psy-chotic relapse (375–379).
When patients with schizophrenia present with depressive features, important differential
diagnostic possibilities need to be considered (368, 380). These include side effects of antipsy-chotic medications (including medication-induced dysphoria, akinesia, and akathisia), demoral-ization, and the primary negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Concurrent abuse or the suddenwithdrawal of substances such as cannabis, cocaine, narcotics, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeinecan also lead to depression. When the depressive symptoms are present at a syndromal level dur-ing the acute phase of the schizophrenic illness, the possibility of schizoaffective disorder shouldbe considered.
Depressive symptoms that occur during the acute psychotic phase usually improve as the pa-
tient recovers from the psychosis. There is also evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms arereduced by antipsychotic treatment, with comparison trials finding that second-generation anti-psychotics may have greater efficacy for depressive symptoms than first-generation antipsychot-ics (381, 382). However, there is also evidence to suggest that this apparent antidepressant effectmay be related to the lower likelihood of neurological side effects with second-generation anti-psychotics (222, 368, 383, 384). The approach hence is first to treat the psychosis.
If antipsychotic medication-induced dysphoria is suspected, then antipsychotic dose reduc-
tion may be effective. Alternatively, the clinician may switch the patient’s medication to an anti-psychotic with a lower risk of inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (Table 4). There is no evidencethat medications that treat the motor symptoms of extrapyramidal side effects (e.g., benztropine,amantadine) (Table 5) are effective for the treatment of neuroleptic-induced dysphoria.
Antidepressants are added as an adjunct to antipsychotics when the depressive symptoms
meet the syndromal criteria for major depressive disorder, are severe and causing significant dis-tress (e.g., when accompanied by suicidal ideation), or are interfering with function. T ricyclicantidepressants have been extensively studied in the treatment of postpsychotic depression(103, 385). Antidepressants, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) anddual reuptake inhibitors, have also been found to be useful in the treatment of depression inschizophrenia (368, 384). However, very few studies have examined the effects of antidepres-sants in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic medications, making it difficultto evaluate the current utility of adjunctive antidepressant agents. When prescribed, antide-pressants are used in the same doses that are used for treatment of major depressive disorder.There are, however, potential pharmacokinetic interactions with certain antipsychotic medica-tions; for example, the SSRIs (such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine) are inhibitorsof cytochrome P450 enzymes and thereby increase antipsychotic plasma levels. Similarly, theblood levels of some antidepressants may be elevated by the concomitant administration ofantipsychotic medications.
e) Risk of suicide
Suicide is the leading cause of premature death among persons with schizophrenia (386, 387).Compared to the general population, persons with schizophrenia are nine times more likely todie by suicide (388). Up to 30% of patients with schizophrenia attempt suicide (389), and be-tween 4% and 10% die by suicide (390–394). The estimated rate of suicidal behavior amongpersons with schizophrenia is between 20% and 40% (395, 396).
Some risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia are the same as those for the general popula-
tion, including being male, white, single, socially isolated, and unemployed; having a positivefamily history of suicide; previous suicide attempts; having a substance use disorder; being de-pressed or hopeless; and having a significant recent adverse life event. Specific risk factors forsuicide among persons with schizophrenia are young age, high socioeconomic status back-

46 APA Practice Guidelinesground, high IQ with a high level of premorbid scholastic achievement, high aspirations and
expectations, an early age at onset of illness/first hospitalization, a chronic and deterioratingcourse with many relapses, and greater insight into the illness (391, 397–401). A change in theenvironment, such as a hospital admission and discharge, may trigger suicidal behavior (402,403). Suicide is more common within the first 6 years of the initial hospitalization and alsoduring periods of remission after 5–10 years of illness. Other risk factors include severe de-pressive and psychotic symptoms, with an increase in the patient’s paranoid behavior (395,404–406). Suicidal ideation has also been shown to be predictive of suicide over the subsequent2–4 weeks (407). As patients do not often report suicidal ideation spontaneously, clinicians areencouraged to ask patients about suicidal ideas whenever there is suggestion that they could bepresent (e.g., in the presence of depression or severe stress). Treatment-related factors associatedwith suicide include inadequate antipsychotic treatment, nonadherence to the medication reg-imen, and lack of response to medication (408). In several case reports, suicide has also beennoted among patients with akathisia (409, 410).
Despite identification of these risk factors, it is not possible to predict whether an individual
patient will attempt suicide or will die by suicide. Suicide thus must be considered at all stagesof the illness, and suicide risk must be assessed initially and regularly as part of each patient’spsychiatric evaluation. The patient’s desire to die may be more important than the lethality ofthe methods used (403). Additional information may be obtained from close family membersand treating therapists. Patients should be admitted to a secure inpatient unit if they are judgedto be at substantial risk for suicide.
It is important to maximize the treatment of both psychosis and depression. There is sug-
gestive evidence that both first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications may reducethe risk of suicide (411). However, clozapine is the most extensively studied and has beenshown to have the greatest therapeutic effect on suicidal behavior, possibly reducing the suiciderate by as much as 75%–85% (55, 398, 399, 412). For these reasons, clozapine should be pref-erentially considered for patients with a history of chronic and persistent suicidal ideation orbehaviors.
During the initial hospitalization, suicide precautions should be instituted, and the patient
must be closely monitored to prevent escape. There should also be minimal use of ward trans-fers. Suicide risk should be examined carefully before a patient is granted any privileges andagain before the patient is finally discharged from the hospital. The patient and the patient’sfamily members should be advised to look for warning signs and to initiate specific contingencyplans if suicidal ideation recurs. In outpatients, the frequency of visits should be higher after arecent discharge from the hospital and may need to be increased in times of personal crisis, sig-nificant environmental changes, heightened distress, or deepening depression during thecourse of illness.
For additional information, readers are directed to APA’s Practice Guideline for the Assessment
and Treatment of Patients With Suicidal Behaviors  (56).
f) Aggressive behaviorAlthough only a minority of patients with schizophrenia are violent, evidence does suggest thatschizophrenia is associated with an increase in the risk of aggressive behavior (413–419). So-ciodemographic risk factors for aggression in schizophrenia are male gender; being poor, un-skilled, uneducated, or unmarried; and having a history of prior arrests or a prior history ofviolence (420). The risk for aggressive behavior increases with comorbid alcohol abuse, sub-stance abuse, antisocial personality, or neurological impairment (421–427). Violent patientswith schizophrenia have more positive symptoms and bizarre behaviors and may act on theirdelusions, especially if the delusions are distressing and the patient can find evidence to supportthem (428–430). Patients who experience command hallucinations to harm others are alsomore likely to be violent (431).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 47Identifying risk factors for violence and assessment of dangerousness are parts of a standard
psychiatric evaluation, which should be conducted in an environment that is safe for both the
patient and clinician (432). It is important to determine if use of alcohol or other substances,including use of amphetamines or other stimulants, is causing or contributing to aggressive be-havior. Severe akathisia associated with prescribed medications may also cause or contribute toaggressive behavior. It is important to inquire about thoughts of violence and determine thepersons to whom these thoughts are directed. Parents, for example, are frequent targets of vio-lence when it occurs (433). When a patient is found to pose a serious threat to others (e.g.,having homicidal ideation with imminent plans), the psychiatrist should consider hospitalizingthe patient and must exercise his or her own best judgment, in accord with the legal require-ments of the jurisdiction, to protect those people from foreseeable harm (54, 434).
If the patient is acutely aggressive, the clinician can try to calm the patient by distraction or
“talking down” techniques. If restraint or seclusion is needed, it should be done with adequatenumbers of well-trained professional staff (70). When sedation is indicated and the patient isunwilling to accept oral medication, intramuscular injection of a first-generation antipsychoticagent (5 mg of haloperidol) (75) or second-generation agent (e.g., ziprasidone) (76–79) can begiven, with or without a concomitant dose of 1–2 mg of oral or intramuscular lorazepam (72–74). Other medications, such as 5 mg i.m. of droperidol, can be used in selected clinical situa-tions of extreme emergency or in highly agitated patients (80, 435). However, if droperidol isused, its potential for cardiac rhythm disturbances must be considered, as indicated in its label-ing by a black-box warning for QTc prolongation. After seclusion, restraint, or sedation, themental status and vital signs of the patient should be monitored regularly. Release from seclusionor restraint can proceed in a graded fashion, as risk of harm to self or others diminishes (432).
Limit setting and behavioral approaches have been employed for the management of persistent-
ly violent patients (432, 436). Antipsychotic medications remain the mainstay of management(421, 437), with good evidence for clozapine in particular (438–440). Other agents have beenused, including mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate), SSRIs (such as citalopram), benzodiazepines,and β-adrenergic blocking agents (propranolol, nadolol), but empirical evidence is lacking.
It is common for patients with schizophrenia in the community to stop taking their medica-
tions. Patients who are more likely to be violent with psychotic relapses are of particular concernand may be primary candidates for mandatory outpatient treatment programs (441) (see SectionII.A.3, “Developing a Therapeutic Alliance and Promoting Treatment Adherence”).
g) Psychosis-induced polydipsia
Polydipsia is compulsive water drinking, usually in excess of 3 liters per day. It can be compli-cated by water intoxication, i.e., severe hyponatremia (serum sodium <120 mmol/liter), whichis potentially fatal, as the associated cerebral edema can result in delirium, seizures, coma, anddeath. About 20%–25% of chronically ill inpatients have primary polydipsia, and as many as10% have a history of water intoxication (442–445).
The pathophysiology of the water imbalance is still unclear. It occurs most commonly in the
most severely ill patients with schizophrenia and thus has been termed “psychosis-induced poly-dipsia.” Polydipsia and water intoxication are associated with long hospitalization, high doses ofantipsychotic medications, moderate doses of anticholinergic medications, and heavy smoking(442, 444). Development of hyponatremia has also been associated with use of diuretics, SSRIsand venlafaxine (446, 447), tricyclic antidepressants, and calcium antagonists (448). Polydipsiahas also been known to occur prior to the introduction of antipsychotic medications (449).
The approach to psychosis-induced polydipsia is to control both the psychosis and water
intake after excluding possible underlying medical causes of polydipsia, such as diabetes melli-tus, diabetes insipidus, chronic renal failure, malignancy, pulmonary disease, hypocalcemia,and hypokalemia. Acute management involves water restriction and sodium replacement toprevent seizures. Clozapine appears to be effective, albeit in studies with small sample sizes

48 APA Practice Guidelines(450–452). The second-generation antipsychotics have also been examined for their role in the
long-term management of the condition (453, 454). Various other medications, including de-meclocycline (455, 456), naltrexone (457), enalapril (458), clonidine (458, 459), and propran-olol (460), have also been used in some case studies.
2. Demographic and psychosocial variables
a) HomelessnessBy current estimates, as many as 800,000 Americans are homeless on any given night; an esti-mated one-fourth of these people have serious mental illnesses, and more than one-half have analcohol and/or drug problem (461). Schizophrenia is a risk factor for homelessness, as is infec-tious disease, alcohol and other substance use, depression, and social isolation (462, 463). Com-prehensive reviews have suggested that the rate of schizophrenia in homeless persons has rangedfrom 2% to 45%. Methodologically superior studies have produced estimates of 4%–16%, witha weighted average prevalence of 11% (464). Factors that have been noted to contribute to themagnitude of homelessness among patients with schizophrenia include deinstitutionalization(465), limitations of public funding, problems in service integration, and lack of low-cost hous-ing (466). Substance use disorders contribute substantially to homelessness among patients withschizophrenia. Many housing programs do not accept patients with schizophrenia who use al-cohol or other substances, and treatment for substance use disorders is often lacking for theseindividuals (466). In addition, the illness of schizophrenia may directly predispose persons tohousing difficulties through withdrawal, disorganization, and disruptive behaviors (467).
Homeless mentally ill persons are likely to have multiple impairments. Most lack basic health
care, income, and any social support network. Only  slightly more than one-half of the homeless
persons with schizophrenia have been found to be currently receiving psychiatric treatment(464). Homeless persons with schizophrenia have been found to have elevated rates of victim-ization (468) and to have mortality rates that are three to four times higher than the expectedrate (469). Further, a large study of mentally ill homeless veterans found that a majority of home-less veterans contacted through a national outreach program did not receive medical serviceswithin 6 months of program entry (470). Medical treatment is thus a great challenge for thispopulation.
Given the level of need of this population, services should include provision of appropriate
housing, access to medical services, treatment of substance use disorders, income support andbenefits, and rehabilitation and employment assistance (466). Such services must be compre-hensive, continuous, accessible, and individualized (467). A number of controlled studies havedemonstrated the effectiveness of such treatment models for reducing homelessness and im-proving psychiatric outcomes (164, 471). The Center for Mental Health Services conducted amultisite 5-year demonstration program called Access to Community Care and Effective Ser-vices and Supports (ACCESS) to test the effect of the integration of fragmented services intreating homeless persons with serious mental illness. This study involved 18 sites in nine statesfrom 1993 to 1998, and treatment outcomes were studied at both the system and patient levels.All project sites conducted extensive outreach efforts to engage homeless persons and provideda comprehensive range of services, including mental health treatment, medications, substanceuse disorder treatment or referral, job placement, housing support, social support, and primaryhealth care. Patients served in the ACCESS program showed improved housing stability andreductions in substance use and minor criminal incidents, as well as increased use of psychiatricoutpatient care, although integration of treatment did not influence these outcomes. The pro-vision of direct community services and outreach appeared to be most important.
Clinical care of homeless mentally ill patients involves three basic stages: 1) engagement,
2) intensive care, and 3) ongoing rehabilitation (472). In introducing services into the commu-nity, psychiatrists must be prepared to work with homeless patients in nonclinical environments,

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 49including streets, shelters, subways, bus terminals, and other public spaces. In discussing out-
reach to homeless patients with schizophrenia, Goldfinger (467) stressed the importance of en-gagement. Homeless patients with schizophrenia are often fearful and distrustful of the mentalhealth system, and they can require a combination of patience, persistence, and understanding.Depending on the needs and wants of a particular patient, the provision of food, clothing,medical attention, or simply company can be indispensable in developing a therapeutic rela-tionship. As noted by Goldfinger (467), such provisions document one’s concern, demonstrateone’s reliability, and acknowledge the importance of the needs of the homeless person withschizophrenia. T o engage the homeless person with schizophrenia, active outreach is usuallynecessary and is often performed by case managers. In particular, street outreach to homelesspersons with serious mental illness is justified, as they have been found to be more severely im-paired, to have more basic service needs, to be less motivated to seek treatment, and to take long-er to engage than those contacted in other settings. The ACCESS program found that patientsengaged from the street showed improvement on nearly all outcome measures that was equiva-lent to that of enrolled patients who were contacted in shelters and other service agencies (473).
Despite appropriate outreach efforts, some homeless persons with mental illness are so im-
paired that they remain unable to recognize their basic needs or avoid personal dangers. Oneprogram developed to address the treatment needs of this population was the Homeless Emer-gency Liaison Project (Project HELP), in which a mobile treatment team arranged for invol-untary psychiatric emergency department evaluation of high-risk homeless patients (474).Involuntary hospitalization resulted from 93% of such evaluations, and 80% of all patients re-ceived the diagnosis of schizophrenia. At 2-year follow-up of 298 patients initially evaluatedduring the project, only 12% were found to be back living on the streets.
b) Cultural factors
Cultural factors are known to affect the course, diagnosis, and treatment of schizophrenia(475). There is a robust pattern of evidence that race has a substantial effect on whether personswith substantively similar symptoms receive a diagnosis of an affective disorder or a schizophre-nia spectrum psychotic disorder. Compared with Caucasians, African Americans, especiallymen, are less likely to receive a diagnosis of a mood disorder and more likely to receive a diag-nosis of schizophrenia (476–479). African Americans with schizophrenia are also less likely toreceive a diagnosis of a comorbid affective or anxiety disorder (480, 481). While it is possiblethat such differences may reflect actual illness variation among racial/ethnic groups, there isgrowing evidence that cultural differences in symptom and personal presentation, help seeking,interpretation of symptoms and clinical judgments by (usually Caucasian) clinicians, and treat-ment referral are likely causing race-linked biases in diagnosis and therefore in treatment (e.g.,see references 482–486). Additional possible causes or contributors to this pattern of disparityinclude low levels of cultural competence among clinicians, unbalanced research samples, inaccu-rate or biased pathology assessment tools, and the failure of researchers to control for socioeco-nomic status, education, and urbanicity (487, 488). These remarkably consistent findingssuggest that clinicians should be mindful of the extent to which cultural factors influence theirdiagnostic approach.
c) Race
Once patients receive a diagnosis, substantial data suggest that race affects the type of pharma-cological treatment they receive. For example, the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes ResearchT eam (PORT) (65) showed that among patients for whom psychotropic medications at dosesoutside the recommended range were prescribed, patients from racial/ethnic minority groups(especially African Americans) were much more likely than Caucasian patients to receive dosesabove recommended levels. The same patients were also more likely to receive prophylacticantiparkinsonian agents, suggesting increased rates of adverse side effects related to higher doses.

50 APA Practice GuidelinesPrescription of higher doses of antipsychotic medications to African American patients has also
been noted in several other reports (489–493).
However, in another PORT study, among patients with schizophrenia who were also expe-
riencing significant depression, Caucasian patients were significantly more likely to receive ad-junctive medications (494). In addition, there is growing evidence that racial/ethnic minoritypatients with psychotic disorders are less likely than Caucasian patients to receive second-genera-tion antipsychotics and more likely to receive long-acting injectable agents (495–498). Otherresearch suggests that these gaps may be decreasing over time but are still persistent and maybe related to differential prescribing patterns in private versus managed health care (496, 499).
There is clearly a need for more research to describe and understand the differences in pat-
terns of treatment by race and ethnicity. Most of the published research focuses on AfricanAmericans; the needs and treatments of other cultural groups also require attention. The ob-served phenomena provide little guidance about whether the care delivered is appropriate. Inthe meantime, the strength and consistency of these findings suggest that clinicians should con-sider the extent to which a patient’s race and/or ethnicity are playing a role in the treatmentand should ensure that care is being individualized and optimized.
T o some extent, differences in drug dosing or side effect risk may be related to genetically
based differences in drug metabolism. For example, the activity of the enzyme encoded by theCYP2D6 gene is very low or absent in 5%–8% of Caucasians but only 2%–5% of AfricanAmericans and Asians. Low activity of the enzyme encoded by the CYP2D6 gene may dramat-ically affect the metabolism of many drugs, increasing serum levels (500). There is also sugges-tive evidence that up to one-third of African Americans possess genetic polymorphisms of otherenzymes that metabolize psychotropic agents, resulting in altered metabolism and potential forenhanced medication side effects. Ethnic factors may also confer a susceptibility to medicationside effects in certain persons. For example, patients of Jewish descent have been noted to be atgreater risk for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis than other patients with schizophrenia (501)and therefore may require close monitoring during clozapine treatment.
d) Gender
There are numerous gender differences in the presentation and course of schizophrenia (502–505). Men with schizophrenia have been noted to have a younger age at onset, a poorer premor-bid history, more negative symptoms, a greater likelihood of having the deficit syndrome (306,309), and a poorer overall course than women with schizophrenia (503, 506). Compared withmen, women are more likely to have affective symptoms, auditory hallucinations, and persecu-tory delusions, but they have a better overall course and better outcomes than men, as evidencedby better social and occupational functioning, fewer hospitalizations, and less substance use andantisocial behavior (504, 505, 507). While such differences may be biologically mediated, psy-chosocial factors, including family and societal expectations, may also affect outcome. Haas andcolleagues (507) noted that social and occupational role demands may result in unrealistic familyexpectations of men with schizophrenia, and this issue should be dealt with in treatment.
There are also gender differences in both response to and adverse effects of treatments for
schizophrenia. Most of this research has been conducted with first-generation antipsychotic med-ications. Women exhibit more rapid responses to antipsychotic medications and a greater degreeof improvement in both first-episode and multi-episode schizophrenia (504). It has also been ob-served that even after body weight is considered, women require lower antipsychotic doses (508,509) than men, although there is suggestive evidence that postmenopausal women may requirehigher doses (504). Although women may show greater responsivity to antipsychotics, they alsoexperience more neurological side effects, including acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, andtardive dyskinesia (504). Women also develop higher serum prolactin levels in response to bothfirst-generation antipsychotics and risperidone, compared with men (504), and therefore womenmay be more prone to the sexual side effects of the medications. Finally, although studies of gen-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 51der differences in response to psychosocial treatments are sparse, there is some evidence to suggest
that social skills training may be more effective for male patients, whereas inpatient family inter-ventions have shown greater success in families of female patients (504, 505).
e) Pregnancy
T reatment of the pregnant or lactating patient with schizophrenia must consider two issues:1) risks of various psychotropic medications to the fetus, newborn, and breast-fed infant, and2) adequacy of prenatal care. A general reference on medications in pregnancy and lactation isthe text by Briggs et al. (510).
Controlled studies of psychotropic drug risks during pregnancy are, for obvious ethical rea-
sons, not done. Knowledge of the risks of these agents comes from animal studies and from un-controlled exposures in humans. Nonetheless, there is a body of information that can help guideclinicians’ and patients’ decision making about the use of psychotropic agents during pregnancyand lactation. Risks do vary from drug to drug and from drug class to drug class. In addition,two periods of high risk to the fetus or newborn are identifiable: teratogenic risk is highest in thefirst trimester, and withdrawal risk is highest at the time of birth. Only with planned pregnanciesis management of first trimester psychotropic drug exposure under full control of the doctor andpatient. Drug withdrawal risk at the time of parturition may be more predictable and manage-able, depending on the drug(s) involved and the circumstances of delivery.
There are substantial data on fetal exposure to first-generation antipsychotic medications,
with relatively little evidence of harmful effects, especially with high-potency agents (511–513).Much less information is available regarding fetal exposure to second-generation antipsychoticmedications. Koren et al. (514) found that pregnant women with schizophrenia taking second-generation antipsychotic medications were frequently obese and had inadequate intake of folicacid, putting their offspring at increased risk for neural tube defects. Such an outcome would bean indirect rather than a direct effect of these medications. A limited number of reports of treat-ment with olanzapine during pregnancy and lactation showed that olanzapine did not appear toincrease the risk of harm (515). A case report of clozapine treatment during pregnancy describeddevelopment of gestational diabetes, possibly exacerbated by clozapine, but no fetal abnormali-ties (516). Pregnancy can be a period of decreased symptoms for women with schizophrenia, butrelapses are frequent in the postpartum period (517). Thus, the clinical risks of not using anti-psychotic medications may be somewhat less during pregnancy but are greater thereafter.
Compared with antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines are much
more closely associated with fetal malformations and behavioral effects (511, 513, 518). Thus,their risk/benefit ratio is different, and the need for their continuation during pregnancy andbreast-feeding requires strong clinical justification.
A number of studies have shown that pregnant women with schizophrenia receive relatively
poor prenatal care. These women have more obstetric complications, and their offspring aremore likely to have adverse outcomes, such as low birth weight and stillbirth (519–522). Thereare many contributing factors to the relatively poor prenatal care and outcomes, such as lowsocioeconomic status, high rates of smoking and substance use disorders, and obesity. For theclinician treating a pregnant woman with schizophrenia, it is particularly important to insiston early involvement of an obstetrician who can help reduce the risks of the pregnancy andwith whom risks and benefits of pharmacological treatment options can be discussed.
f) Psychosocial stressors
A variety of psychosocial stressors can precipitate the initial development or recurrence ofsymptoms in a vulnerable person (304, 523–526). Stressors include stressful life events (e.g.,interpersonal loss, leaving home, military service), sociocultural stress (e.g., poverty, homeless-ness, fragmented social network), or a distressing emotional climate (e.g., hostile and criticalattitudes and overprotection by others in one’s living situation or high levels of expressed emo-tion) (282–289). While schizophrenia can emerge or worsen in the absence of environmental

52 APA Practice Guidelinesinfluences, attention to stressors frequently helps to prevent relapse and/or maximize healthy
functioning. Sometimes the stress is internal, and knowledge of developmental vulnerabilitiescan assist in identifying and assisting with this variety of stress. T reatment strategies includepreventing the development or accumulation of stressors and helping the patient develop cop-ing strategies that keep tension levels within manageable bounds.
g) Schizophrenia in later life
With the overall increase in longevity, the number of older patients with schizophrenia is ex-pected to increase rapidly over the next three decades (527). Among middle-aged and elderlypersons with schizophrenia, approximately 80% have early-onset schizophrenia (528), with theremaining 20% including persons with late-onset schizophrenia (onset after age 40) and very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (onset after age 60) (DSM-IV , 529). The rate of aging-associated cognitive decline in older patients with schizophrenia is similar to that in age-com-parable normal persons, although, as with younger patients, they have greater overall cognitiveimpairment (530, 531). The approach to the treatment of older persons with schizophrenia issimilar to that of younger patients (532) and involves combining pharmacotherapies with psy-chosocial interventions.
Several age-related physiological changes may influence the approach to pharmacotherapy.
These physiological changes include reduced cardiac output (and concomitant reduction in re-nal and hepatic blood flow, relative to younger persons), reduced glomerular filtration rate, pos-sible reduction in hepatic metabolism, and increased fat content. These changes may alter theabsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of medications and may result in prolongeddrug effects and greater sensitivity to medications, in terms of both therapeutic response and sideeffects (533). Age-related changes in receptor-site activity may further influence response todrugs in elderly patients. In general, recommended starting doses in older patients are one-quar-ter to one-half of the usual adult starting dose (529) (see T able 2).
The presence of concomitant medical illness or the use of multiple medications frequently
complicates the treatment of older patients. In addition, age-related sensory deficits and cog-nitive impairment may interfere with patients’ adherence to prescribed medication regimens.Elderly patients may unintentionally take incorrect doses of medications or follow erroneousdosing schedules.
Several important considerations bear on the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients. The
cumulative annual incidence of tardive dyskinesia with first-generation antipsychotic medica-tions has been found to be sixfold higher in later life than in younger adults (i.e., about 30%in later life) (534). Other side effects of particular concern in elderly patients include sedation,anticholinergic effects, and postural hypotension. Second-generation antipsychotics are gener-ally recommended over first-generation agents because of their significantly lower risk of in-ducing extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia in older persons (534–538). However,the second-generation agents have other clinically significant and common side effects (Table4), most notably sedation and orthostatic hypotension. Elderly patients with low cardiac out-put are especially vulnerable to hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. The anticholinergic sideeffects of antipsychotic drugs in the presence of the age-related decrease in cholinergic functioncan contribute to problems such as urinary retention, confusion, and constipation or fecal im-paction in the elderly patient. In some cases, elderly patients who are frail or poorly nourishedmay benefit from medication-induced weight gain; however, weight gain may also aggravatepreexisting cardiovascular disease or osteoarthritis in this population. Elevated prolactin levelsmay also compromise bone-mineral density and increase osteoporosis.
Depression is not only common but also functionally disruptive in older persons with
schizophrenia (539). In such instances, an antidepressant may need to be added to the treatmentregimen. A wide variety of antidepressants are commonly used, although no comprehensive com-parative trials in this population have been published. One small study found citalopram to beboth useful and relatively safe in older patients with psychosis (540).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 53Psychosocial treatments are also recommended for a majority of individuals. Psychosocial
evaluation may reveal a precipitating stress, such as a death in the family or a move to unfamiliar
surroundings, that may explain a sudden change in the elderly person’s behavior. Recent work hasevaluated the benefits of integrated cognitive behavioral and social skills training (CBSST) ingroups of older patients with schizophrenia (541). Results of a small randomized, controlledpilot study comparing CBSST plus pharmacotherapy to pharmacotherapy alone demonstratedthe feasibility and acceptability by patients of CBSST and some improvement in psychopathol-ogy with CBSST in older patients with schizophrenia (541). Another pilot study showed theusefulness of functional adaptation skills training (542) in improving daily functioning in olderpatients with schizophrenia.
3. Concurrent general medical conditions
Patients with schizophrenia and related severe and persistent mental illness suffer disproportion-ately from a variety of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, dia-betes, infectious diseases (e.g., HIV), and substance use disorders (including nicotine, alcohol,and other substances) (543–554). A consequence of this excess comorbidity is an increased non-suicide-related mortality rate in this population (34, 388, 555). The increased frequencies of thevarious comorbid conditions are determined by multiple factors, including associations withschizophrenia itself (e.g., diabetes, smoking), life style (e.g., smoking, substance use, obesity,lack of exercise), environment (e.g., poverty, institutionalization), and medications (e.g., ex-trapyramidal syndromes, tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, hyperglycemia,hyperlipidemia, and cardiac arrhythmias). Thus, treatment selection and clinical managementof patients with schizophrenia must consider the patient’s past medical history and general med-ical status of the patient in determining the treatment plan. Patients should be evaluated interms of their medical history and baseline assessments and then monitored with the relevantmeasures at appropriate intervals or when the patient’s medical condition warrants or when achange in medication that could affect their medical condition is made, as indicated in Table 1.In the event that the patient’s comorbid medical condition is affected adversely by a therapeuticagent (including an antipsychotic drug), management strategies may include helping the pa-tient tolerate the adverse effect, treating the comorbid condition, or considering a change in thepsychotropic medication to an alternative with less potential to induce side effects.
Patients with dementia and elderly patients are at very high risk of tardive dyskinesia. In ad-
dition, patients with dementia, Parkinson’s disease, or other disorders associated with structuralbrain pathology are at increased risk of worsening of extrapyramidal side effects. Similarly, pa-tients with psychosis and mental retardation are at increased risk for extrapyramidal side effectsand tardive dyskinesia (556, 557). Thus, in these groups of patients, second-generation antipsy-chotics and particularly those with minimal or no risk of extrapyramidal effects (e.g., quetiapine)are recommended (558, 559). Furthermore, when such patients are treated with antipsychoticdrugs, they must be monitored for side effects, and the increased risk of extrapyramidal sideeffects and tardive dyskinesia must be weighed against potential therapeutic benefits.
For patients with preexisting osteopenia or osteoporosis, an antipsychotic with minimal to
no effects on prolactin should be prescribed. If a drug that increases prolactin is clinically indi-cated, then the relative safety of the antipsychotic should be discussed with the physician treat-ing the bone demineralization. Female patients with menstrual or fertility problems should beevaluated for abnormalities in prolactin secretion, and non-prolactin-elevating medicationsshould be considered as indicated. In addition, for women with breast cancer , antipsychoticswith prolactin-elevating effects should be avoided or prescribed only after consultation with thepatient’s oncologist. In such instances, aripiprazole, which partially suppresses prolactin release,may be specifically indicated. However, in lactating mothers, suppression of prolactin may bedetrimental, and the potential for this effect should be considered.

54 APA Practice GuidelinesObese patients and patients who have or may be at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
ease should be assessed before beginning treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Additional assess-
ments are indicated at appropriate intervals thereafter or when warranted by a change in thepatient’s medical condition or medication regimen (see Table 1). Treatment selection shouldweigh the expected benefits of antipsychotic therapy against its potential to exacerbate or con-tribute to the development of specific medical conditions.
Patients with prolonged QT syndrome, bradycardia, certain electrolyte disturbances, heart
failure, or recent myocardial infarction and patients who are taking drugs that prolong the QTinterval should not be treated with an antipsychotic that could further prolong the QT intervalor increase the risk of the arrhythmia torsades de pointes. These antipsychotics include thio-ridazine, droperidol, and ziprasidone. Pimozide also may prolong the QT interval.
Medications with low affinity for α-adrenergic receptors should be prescribed for patients who
are vulnerable to orthostatic hypotension, including elderly patients, patients with peripheral vas-cular disease or compromised cardiovascular status, and other severely debilitated patients.
For patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, severe constipation (or at risk for fecal obstruc-
tion), history of a paralytic ileus, urinary retention, prostate hypertrophy, or delirium/dementia,antipsychotics with little or no antagonism for cholinergic receptors should be prescribed.
Patients with severe dementia may be at increased risk of stroke when treated with risperi-
done. Clinicians treating psychosis in patients with dementia should refer to up-to-date FDAguidelines when considering the safety of risperidone in this population.
Clozapine should not be prescribed for patients with neutropenia (<1500/mm
3) or low white
blood cell (WBC) count (<3000/mm3) or a history of such sensitivities to prior medications.
III. TREATMENT SETTINGS AND HOUSING OPTIONS
/L50776 A. CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTING OR HOUSING
Patients with schizophrenia may receive care in a variety of settings. Choice of setting may beguided by a number of factors, summarized in Table 6. In general, patients should be cared forin the least restrictive setting that is likely to be safe and to allow for effective treatment.
/L50776 B. COMMON TREATMENT SETTINGS
1. Hospitals
T reatment in the hospital has the advantage of providing a safe, structured, and supervised en-vironment and reducing stress in both patients and family members. It allows the psychiatristto closely monitor the level of the patient’s symptoms, the patient’s level of functioning and re-actions to treatment, and side effects of treatment.
Hospitalization is usually indicated for patients who are considered to pose a serious threat
of harm to themselves or others or who are so severely disorganized or under the influence ofdelusions or hallucinations that they are unable to care for themselves and need constant su-pervision or support. Other possible indications for hospitalization include general medical orpsychiatric problems that make outpatient treatment unsafe or ineffective (e.g., if a patient’spsychiatric status continues to deteriorate despite optimal care in the community). Patientswho cannot be adequately cared for in nonhospital settings should be hospitalized voluntarilyif possible. If patients decline voluntary status, they can be hospitalized involuntarily if theircondition meets the criteria for involuntary admission of the local jurisdiction.
Alternative treatment settings should be considered when it is uncertain whether the patient
needs to be hospitalized or when the patient does not need formal hospitalization but requires

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 55more intensive services than can be expected in a typical outpatient setting (560). Alternative
treatment settings in the community may include day or partial hospitalization, home care,family crisis therapy, crisis residential care, and assertive community treatment (see Part B, Sec-tion V .C.1.a, “Program for Assertive Community T reatment [PACT]”). A recent meta-analysishas shown that such alternatives to hospitalization for acutely ill patients can sometimes be atleast as effective and sometimes more effective than hospitalization in terms of reducing loss tofollow-up, reducing family burden, and increasing the patient’s and family’s satisfaction whilebeing cost-neutral (561). These crisis intervention programs typically provide medication anda mobile multidisciplinary team that is available outside of traditional office hours. Other stud-ies have demonstrated that crisis intervention can be associated with reduced symptoms, pre-served role functioning, and reduced hospital readmission rates (181, 562–570).
Patients may be moved from one level of care to another on the basis of the factors summa-
rized in Table 6, with an ongoing assessment of their readiness and ability to benefit from adifferent level of care. The choice of residence must be guided by the availability of housingand accompanying psychiatric support programs as well as by the patient’s and family’s prefer-ences and resources.
Since a major aim of acute hospitalization is to facilitate rapid resolution of acute symptoms
through the provision of a safe, nonstressful therapeutic environment, the hospital milieushould be organized to help achieve this goal. In consideration of the severe symptoms and cog-nitive impairment in acute schizophrenia, the hospital milieu should be highly structured; staffmembers should be clearly identifiable and should always wear name tags, whether they wearuniforms or street clothes; calendars and clocks should be in evidence on the ward; and wardschedules should be posted in order to provide a clear-cut external structure for the patients, whooften have disorganized and impaired reality testing (571).TABLE 6.

56 APA Practice GuidelinesFor acutely ill patients whose psychotic symptoms respond rapidly to antipsychotic medica-
tion, a brief hospitalization followed by day hospitalization when indicated has been shown to
be as effective as or more effective than longer-term hospitalization, with no increase in rehospi-talization rate and better maintenance of role functioning and less family burden at 1- and 2-year follow-up (571, 572). A number of randomized controlled studies have compared shorterand longer lengths of hospitalization. In the United States the shortest average duration of hos-pitalization studied was 11 days, which was compared with an average stay of 60 days for thecontrol group (572), while in England, Hirsch et al. (573) compared outcomes for an averagestay of 9 days with those for an average stay of 14 days. Other studies examined the effects ofshorter and longer hospitalizations, but the general conclusion from all of the studies was thatlonger hospitalization conferred no additional benefit over shorter hospitalization in such areasas symptom improvement, community adjustment, and readmission rate (574–584). Brief hos-pitalization allows for effective treatment in the least restrictive environment but is optimal onlywhen there is a system of community care in place and patients adhere to follow-up treatment.Thus, when there is no longer a clear-cut need for the patient to remain in the hospital and com-munity treatment is available and accessible, the psychiatrist should consider discharging the pa-tient from the hospital. On the other hand, if adequate community treatment and supportresources are not in place, patients should not be discharged until they have achieved sufficientremission to enable them to function in the community without such supports.
2. Long-term hospitalization
Before the introduction of clozapine, 10%–20% of persons with schizophrenia remained se-verely psychotic with grossly impaired functioning despite optimal pharmacological and con-ventional care (585). The degree to which this percentage has been decreased by the availabilityof clozapine and other agents is unclear, but there remains a group of patients who require long-term, supervised hospitalization for their safety and protection, as well as for the protection ofthe family and community (586–588).
The organization of the long-stay hospital ward, the training and duties of its personnel, and
the quality of care provided vary greatly and determine the therapeutic value of the hospitalexperience (589, 590). Studies have suggested that patients with treatment-resistant schizo-phrenia who require long-term hospitalization profit most from treatment programs that em-phasize highly structured behavioral techniques, including a token economy, point systems,and skills training that can improve patients’ functioning (591, 592). Paradoxically, despite itsdemonstrated efficacy, the token economy is not often used in clinical settings (593, 594). Ob-stacles to its implementation include resistance by staff members who hold to traditional cus-todial methods, increased costs (for the reinforcers backing up the tokens), lack of support fromadministrators, and inadequate training of clinical staff (595).
3. Crisis residential programs
The treatment of patients outside of large institutions is a fundamental objective of communitypsychiatry, and this objective creates the need for adequate community-based acute care as partof the comprehensive array of services needed to support persons with serious mental illness inthe community. In many mental health systems, acute-care episodes involving hospitalizationare the single largest cost element in the array of services needed to provide community care.Crisis residential facilities are homes in neighborhoods that are staffed and organized to acceptand treat patients with serious mental illness in lieu of voluntary psychiatric admission. Crisisresidential programs 1) provide short-term monitoring and crisis intervention in a residential,nonhospital setting as an alternative to inpatient care; 2) are staffed 24 hours per day/7 daysper week; and 3) support patients in maintaining continuity with their outpatient caregiversand social networks during an acute-care episode. Crisis residential models have been studiedas alternatives to hospitalization for patients with serious mental illness who 1) are willing to ac-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 57cept voluntary treatment, 2) do not require emergent medical assessment for an unstable med-
ical condition, and 3) do not require acute substance detoxification. The findings of threerandomized controlled trials indicate that crisis residential programs can deliver clinical out-comes comparable to those of hospital care at significantly less cost. In addition, crisis residen-tial models have been successfully integrated into mental health systems in demonstrationprojects in a wide range of communities throughout the United States and overseas. Crisis res-idential models of acute care comport with community mental health practice that values theprovision of needed care in the least restrictive or most integrated setting (596–600).
4. Day hospitalization or partial hospitalization
Day hospitalization can be used as an immediate alternative to inpatient care for acutely psy-chotic patients or to continue stabilization after a brief hospital stay. The day hospital should bestaffed in a manner similar to the staffing of the day shift for an acute inpatient service, withclose coordination with and involvement of family members and/or supervised residence staff.Brief overnight stays on inpatient units should be available for patients who demonstrate severeexacerbation of symptoms. As with all alternatives to inpatient care for acutely ill patients, thepatient should not be considered at risk of harming self or others, should have the capacity tocooperate at least minimally in treatment, should have a significant other willing to provide care(a crisis residence can perform the same function), and should have access to appropriate com-munity treatment resources. T reatment alternatives such as day hospitalization have the poten-tial advantages of less disruption of the patient’s life, treatment in a less restrictive and moreintegrated environment, and avoidance of the stigma attached to psychiatric hospitalization.
Controlled studies have shown that day hospitalization is at least as effective as acute inpa-
tient care, and in some studies more effective, in such measures as decreasing symptoms and therehospitalization rate and better preserving role functioning (562, 563, 573, 601–609). Meta-analyses have shown that day hospitalization has been associated with reductions in overall daysof inpatient care, more rapid resolution of symptoms, and decreased overall costs with no in-crease in burden to family members. Social functioning did not differ across treatment settings(562, 563, 597, 598, 604, 606, 608, 610–614). The Cochrane review (609) combined datafrom nine studies involving acutely ill patients, the majority of whom had a diagnosis of schizo-phrenia. The review found that, at the most pessimistic estimate, day hospital treatment was fea-sible for 23% (N=2,268, 95% CI=21%–25%) of those currently admitted to inpatient care.
5. Day treatment
Generally, day treatment programs are used to provide ongoing supportive care for marginally ad-justed patients with schizophrenia in the later part of the stabilization phase and the stable phaseof illness. Such programs, which are usually not time limited, provide structure, support, andtreatment programs to help prevent relapse and to maintain and gradually improve the patient’ssocial functioning. Long-term day treatment attendance was thought to improve engagement(615), improve clinical outcome (615), and reduce readmission rates (616, 617). However, aCochrane review found that there was no evidence that day care centers were better or worse thanoutpatient care in their effects on any clinical or social outcome variable (609). There was someevidence that day treatment might be more expensive than outpatient care (156, 618, 619).
However, the development of effective models of vocational rehabilitation and social skills
training, as discussed in Part B, Sections V .C.1.c, “Supported Employment” and V .C.1.e, “So-cial Skills T raining,” respectively, renders some of the previous research on day treatment as a“setting” of care to be less relevant than research on the types of programs that should be pro-vided to patients with schizophrenia who are in the stable phase of illness and in need of re-covery-oriented services. At this point in the development of psychosocial services, theeffectiveness of day programs is likely to be a function of the quality of the programmingpatients receive while they attend. Thus, when planning for treatment in the stable phase of

58 APA Practice Guidelinesillness, the clinician should carefully evaluate the available programming and help the patient
implement a plan based on the patient’s preferences and needs and on the availability of servicesthat are recovery focused and consistent with evidence-based practices.
6. Housing
The advent of community-based care has produced a challenge regarding the housing of personswith severe mental illness and its connection to psychiatric care. Other than living with family,choices include hostels, group homes, therapeutic communities, and supported independenttenancies. Increasingly, people with severe mental illness are choosing to live as independentlyas possible in self-contained accommodations because sharing accommodation with other res-idents who also have mental illness can seem like living in an institution (620). T wo essentialparadigms have been promoted. In the transitional housing paradigm, patients live in housingthat is directly connected to psychiatric treatment. The acceptance of treatment is often a con-tingency of using such housing. The underlying assumption is that patients “ transition ”through housing with decreasing levels of supervision as their mental status improves. A secondparadigm is that of supported housing. In this paradigm, housing is not directly connected totreatment. Housing is typically in independent units, and mental health services are providedas needed in order to support patients in retaining their housing. Therefore, in a transitionalhousing model, a patient who is experiencing a relapse or worsening of symptoms would bemoved to a housing setting with a higher level of supervision. In a supported housing model,such a patient would simply receive increased psychiatric services in his or her home, to facili-tate housing stability.
The type of supported housing available to people with mental disorders seems to be depen-
dent on the local availability of resources (621).
According to Budson (622), the most common types of residential facilities used currently
include:
Transitional halfway houses. A transitional halfway house is defined as a residential
facility providing room and board and promoting socialization until suitable housing isavailable (623). It is used as a transitional facility between the hospital and the communityfor recovering patients.
Long-term group residences. These facilities have on-site staff and are used for chronically
functionally disabled persons. The length of stay is indefinite, in contrast to the lengthof stay in a halfway house, which is usually 6–8 months.
Cooperative apartments. No on-site staff persons are present in cooperative apartments,
but staff members make regular visits for oversight and guidance of residents.
Intensive-care or crisis community residences. These facilities can be used to help prevent
hospitalization or shorten the length of hospitalization. Usually, there are on-site nursingpersonnel and counseling staff.
Foster or family care. Some patients are placed in foster or family care in private homes.
There is a concern that in some situations only a custodial function may be provided(624). Close supervision of foster families is necessary to ensure that patients are livingin a therapeutic environment.
Board-and-care homes. These facilities are generally proprietary rooming houses. As
with family care, close monitoring and supervision are necessary, since some of thesefacilities provide substandard environments for patients.
Nursing homes. Nursing homes are suitable for some geriatric or chronically medically
disabled patients, but they have been used inappropriately for other long-term patientsto facilitate discharge, mainly from state hospitals. Various investigators have suggestedthat more developed activity programs and psychiatric supervision are needed to preventdeclines in nursing home residents’ social functioning and self-care.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 59Research on the merits of different housing programs and arrangements is inconclusive. For
example, Friedrich et al. (625) examined housing preferences of persons with severe mental ill-
ness living in three types of community residences by surveying both patients and family mem-bers. Although a larger proportion of family members than patients preferred housing withmore support, for both groups, current and preferred residence were consistent. For patientsliving independently, social isolation was perceived as a problem by patients and family mem-bers. The authors concluded that although supported housing works well for some persons, acontinued need exists for an array of housing options with varying levels of structure. In con-trast, a 10-site Scandinavian study (626) found that independent housing was related to a bet-ter quality of life concerning living situation and a better social network regarding availabilityand adequacy of emotional relations.
Dedicated programs whereby people with severe mental illness are located within one site
or building with assistance from professional workers have the potential for great benefit, asthey provide a safe haven for people in need of stability and support. This potential benefit,however, may be provided at the risk of increasing patients’ dependence on professionals andprolonging exclusion from the community. Whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks canbe only a matter of opinion in the absence of reliable evidence. Thus, there is an urgent needto investigate the effects of supported housing on people with severe mental illness within arandomized trial (627). 
Newman (628) critically reviewed studies of the relationship between housing attributes
and serious mental illness. Three studies found no effect of improved housing adequacy onhousing satisfaction in addition to that provided by case management. Three studies found thatfewer housing occupants led to better outcomes. The strongest finding from the literature onhousing as a variable and as an outcome was that living in independent housing was associatedwith greater satisfaction with the housing and the neighborhood. However, given the method-ological weaknesses of these studies, Newman pointed out the critical need for a coherent agen-da built around key hypotheses and for a uniform set of measures of housing as a variable andas an outcome.
7. Correctional settings
The number of persons with schizophrenia incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United Stateshas grown dramatically over the past two decades, paralleling the increase in incarcerationamong the general population (629). Generally, the rates of schizophrenia in correctional set-tings have been found to be significantly higher than in the general community population(630), with 1.8%–4.4% of incarcerated persons meeting the diagnostic criteria for schizophre-nia (631). Consequently, screening of newly arrived detainees and inmates by correctional offic-ers or health care staff members is important in identifying persons with schizophrenia or otherpsychotic disorders who will require more in-depth psychiatric assessment and treatment (632).
Since suicide is common in jails and prisons (633) and since newly incarcerated persons are
at increased risk for suicide (56), screening of incarcerated persons with schizophrenia shouldinclude questions about suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Periodic reassessment is rec-ommended since persons with schizophrenia may develop suicidal ideas or become more symp-tomatic while in a jail or prison. This worsening of symptoms can result from a number offactors, including stress related to incarceration, removal from support systems, and inadequatemental health services within the correctional setting (632).
For detainees and inmates who are identified as having schizophrenia or other serious men-
tal illnesses, a variety of levels of mental health care may exist in the correctional system, including“outpatient” care, specialized housing, and “inpatient” care. In fact, correctional facilities are con-stitutionally required to provide adequate treatment to incarcerated persons with serious men-tal illnesses such as schizophrenia. Minimum standards for an acceptable treatment programwere established in Ruiz v. Estelle  (634) and include screening and evaluation; treatment be-

60 APA Practice Guidelinesyond simple segregation and supervision; the use of adequate numbers of competent mental
health professionals; individualized treatment; accurate, complete, and confidential medicalrecord keeping; appropriate supervision of use of psychiatric medications; and identification,treatment, and supervision of inmates at risk for suicide. These minimum standards have beenendorsed and expanded by other organizations, including APA (632).
Since jails are local facilities used for the confinement of persons awaiting trial or those con-
victed of minor crimes, mental health treatment of jail inmates is often limited by the shortlength of stay and small size of the facility. Treatment generally emphasizes prescription of psy-chotropic medications or crisis intervention services, which may include transfer to specialhousing units, special observation, and brief psychotherapy. Some longer-term psychotherapiesmay be available to inmates whose pretrial confinements or sentences are of a greater duration.The essential mental health services for a jail population include access to inpatient psychiatricbeds; mental health care coverage that is available 7 days a week; availability of a full range ofpsychotropic medications that are prescribed and monitored by a psychiatrist; appropriate nurs-ing coverage in any medical health area, including mental health; and procedures developedand monitored by psychiatrists and nurses to ensure that psychotropic medications are distrib-uted by qualified medical personnel, whenever possible (635).
Prisons are generally under state or federal control and are used to confine persons serving
longer sentences. Consequently, prison mental health systems generally provide a more com-prehensive system of mental health care to persons with schizophrenia than would be availablein a jail setting. In particular, the importance of a chronic care program for inmates with seriousmental illness has become increasingly recognized as an essential component of prison mentalhealth systems. These programs are often known as residential treatment units, intermediatecare units, supportive living units, special needs units, psychiatric services units, or protectiveenvironments for the seriously mentally ill. Inmates appropriate for these units generally havehad significant difficulty functioning in a general population environment because of symp-toms related to their serious mental disorders. These units typically are designed to house 30–50 inmates per housing unit, which allows staffing to be done in a cost-effective fashion (635) .
A psychosocial rehabilitation approach is a frequently used treatment model. For short-termdetainees and inmates, such treatments should focus on symptom management, adjustment tothe correctional setting, planning for upcoming release, and reintegration into the home com-munity. For long-term inmates, the primary foci should be symptom management, relapse pre-vention, and adjustment to incarceration.
If incarcerated persons with schizophrenia refuse treatment, administrative processes may
permit mandated treatment to protect the safety of the person and others. For example, in alljurisdictions, emergency treatment can be instituted if psychosis results in paranoia and threatsto other inmates, to staff, or to the person him- or herself. Some jurisdictions include admin-istrative protocols for nonemergency treatment of inmates who refuse to accept medications(e.g., protocols established by Washington v. Harper  [636]). Thus, clinicians practicing in cor-
rectional settings should become familiar with local and state law and with institutional policyon involuntary treatment.
While incarcerated, inmates with schizophrenia may show symptoms of withdrawal, disor-
ganization, and/or disruptive behavior, which may be associated with disciplinary infractions.These infractions, in turn, may lead the inmate with schizophrenia to be placed in a locked-down setting within units that are often called “administrative segregation” or “disciplinary seg-regation” (637). Such units have been conceptualized as having three main characteristics: so-cial isolation, sensory deprivation, and confinement (638). Each of these elements can varysignificantly, but inmates typically spend an average of 23 hours per day in a cell, have limitedhuman interaction and minimal or no access to programs, and are maintained in an environ-ment that is designed to exert maximum control over the person. Inmates’ responses to the seg-regation experience differ, and relevant scientific literature is sparse (639). Nonetheless, mental

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 61health clinicians working in such facilities frequently report that inmates without preexisting
serious mental disorders develop irritability, anxiety, and other dysphoric symptoms whenhoused in these units for long periods of time (640). Difficulties in providing appropriate andadequate access to mental health care and treatment are especially problematic in any segregationenvironment and are related to logistical issues that frequently include inadequate office spaceand limited access to inmates because of security issues (641). In addition, because of their in-herently punitive structure, such units typically provide very little support, access to relevanttreatment modalities, or therapeutic milieu. Consequently, persons with schizophrenia shouldgenerally not be placed in a 23-hour/day lockdown for behaviors that directly result from theschizophrenia, because such an intervention is likely to exacerbate rather than reduce the symp-toms of schizophrenia as well as increase rather than reduce disruptive behaviors (632, 642).
Before release from a correctional facility, inmates with schizophrenia should be assisted in
finding a source for needed care in the community. In addition, attention should be paid to thehousing and financial needs of inmates nearing release. On leaving the correctional facility,inmates should be provided with enough medication to allow them time to consult a physicianand obtain a new supply.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND 
REVIEW OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
IV. DISEASE DEFINITION, NATURAL HISTORY 
AND COURSE, AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
/L50776 A. CLINICAL FEATURES
Table 7 presents DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, which is a major psychotic
disorder. Its essential features consist of characteristic signs and symptoms that have beenpresent for a significant length of time during a 1-month period (or for a shorter time if suc-cessfully treated), with some signs of the disorder persisting for at least 6 months. No singlesymptom is pathognomonic of schizophrenia. Rather, the symptoms may involve multiple psy-chological realms, such as perception (hallucinations), ideation, reality testing (delusions),thought processes (loose associations), feeling (flatness, inappropriate affect), behavior (catato-nia, disorganization), attention, concentration, motivation (avolition, impaired intention andplanning), and judgment. These psychological and behavioral characteristics are associatedwith a variety of impairments in occupational or social functioning. Although there can bemarked deterioration with impairments in multiple domains of functioning (e.g., learning,self-care, working, interpersonal relationships, and living skills), the disorder is noted for greatheterogeneity across persons and variability within persons over time. It is also associated witha recurrent and progressive course (280, 643). Persons with schizophrenia also suffer dispro-portionately from an increased incidence of general medical illness (644) and increased mor-tality (34, 645–653), especially from suicide, which occurs in up to 10% of patients (643, 654–657).

62 APA Practice GuidelinesTABLE 7. DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophrenia
A. Characteristic symptoms:  Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant 
portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated):
1. delusions
2. hallucinations3. disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence)
4. grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
5. negative symptoms, i.e., affective flattening, alogia, or avolitionNote: Only one Criterion A symptom is required if delusions are bizarre or 
hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's 
behavior or thoughts, or two or more voices conversing with each other.
B. Social/occupational dysfunction:  For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the 
disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational achievement).
C.Duration:  Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-
month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
D.Schizoaffective and Mood Disorder exclusion : Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder 
With Psychotic Features have been ruled out because either (1) no Major Depressive, Manic, or Mixed Episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods.
E. Substance/general medical condition exclusion:  The disturbance is not due to the direct 
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.
F.Relationship to a Pervasive Developmental Disorder:  If there is a history of Autistic Disorder 
or another Pervasive Developmental Disorder, the additional diagnosis of Schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).
Classification of longitudinal course  (can be applied only after at least 1 year has elapsed since 
the initial onset of active-phase symptoms):
Episodic With Interepisode Residual Symptoms (episodes are defined by the reemergence 
of prominent psychotic symptoms); also specify if: With Prominent Negative Symptoms
Episodic With No Interepisode Residual SymptomsContinuous (prominent psychotic symptoms are present throughout the period of 
observation); also specify if: With Prominent Negative Symptoms
Single Episode In Partial Remission; also specify if: With Prominent Negative SymptomsSingle Episode In Full Remission Other or Unspecified Pattern

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 63The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia have often been conceptualized as falling into
two broad categories—positive and negative symptoms. A third category of disorganized symp-
toms has recently been added because statistical analyses show it to be a dimension independentof the positive symptom category, under which it was previously included. The positive symp-toms include delusions and hallucinations. Disorganized symptoms include disorganizedspeech (658) (thought disorder), disorganized behavior, and poor attention. Negative symp-toms include restricted range and intensity of emotional expression (affective flattening), re-duced thought and speech productivity (alogia), anhedonia, and decreased initiation of goal-directed behavior (avolition) (659). Negative symptoms may be primary and represent a corefeature of schizophrenia, or they may be secondary to psychotic symptoms, a depressive syn-drome, medication side effects (e.g., dysphoria), or environmental deprivation.
According to DSM-IV-TR, subtypes of schizophrenia are defined by the predominant
symptoms at the time of the most recent evaluation and therefore may change over time. Thesesubtypes include paranoid type, in which preoccupation with delusions or auditory hallucina-tions is prominent; disorganized type, in which disorganized speech and behavior and flat orinappropriate affect are prominent; catatonic type, in which characteristic motor symptoms areprominent; undifferentiated type, which is a nonspecific category used when none of the othersubtype features are predominant; and residual type, in which there is an absence of prominentpositive symptoms but continuing evidence of disturbance (e.g., negative symptoms or positivesymptoms in an attenuated form) (660). Although the prognostic and treatment implicationsof these subtypes vary, the disorganized type tends to be the most severe and the paranoid typeto be the least severe (661).
Other mental disorders and general medical conditions may be comorbid with schizophre-
nia. Along with general medical conditions, the most common comorbid disorder appears tobe substance use disorder. Commonly abused substances include alcohol (327); stimulantssuch as cocaine and amphetamines (662–664); nicotine, cannabis, phencyclidine (PCP); andLSD (665–667). Such comorbidities can worsen the illness course and complicate treatment(331, 668–670). Individuals with schizophrenia may also experience symptoms of other men-tal disorders, especially depression but also obsessive and compulsive symptoms, somatic con-cerns, dissociative symptoms, and other mood or anxiety symptoms. Whether symptoms aloneare present or whether criteria for comorbid diagnoses are met, these features can significantlyworsen prognosis (671) and often require specific attention and treatment planning. Generalmedical conditions are often present, and persons with schizophrenia may be at special risk forthose associated with poor self-care or institutionalization (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis), sub-stance use (e.g., emphysema and other cigarette-related pathology, HIV-related disease), andantipsychotic-induced movement disorders. Some persons with schizophrenia develop psycho-sis-induced polydipsia, which can lead to water intoxication and hyponatremia.
/L50776 B. NATURAL HISTORY AND COURSE
Schizophrenia can be viewed as a disorder that develops in phases: premorbid, prodromal, andpsychotic (252, 257, 259, 260, 672). The premorbid phase encompasses a period of normativefunction, although the person may experience events that contribute to the development of thesubsequent illness, including complications in pregnancy and delivery during the prenatal andperinatal periods and trauma and family stress during childhood and adolescence (673).
The prodromal phase involves a change from premorbid functioning and extends up to the
time of the onset of frank psychotic symptoms. It may last only weeks or months, but the averagelength of the prodromal phase is between 2 and 5 years (252, 260, 674). During the prodromalphase the person experiences substantial functional impairment and nonspecific symptoms suchas sleep disturbance, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, poor concentration, fatigue, and be-

64 APA Practice Guidelineshavioral deficits such as deterioration in role functioning and social withdrawal (675, 676). Pos-
itive symptoms such as perceptual abnormalities, ideas of reference, and suspiciousness developlate in the prodromal phase and herald the imminent onset of psychosis (677).
The first psychotic episode may be abrupt or insidious in its onset. In most Western coun-
tries, 1–2 years elapse on average between the onset of the first psychotic symptoms and thefirst adequate treatment, defined as the duration of untreated psychosis (252, 259–261, 678).This time period has been found to be significantly longer in men than in women (261).
The psychotic phase progresses through an acute phase, a recovery or stabilization phase,
and a stable phase. The acute phase refers to the presence of florid psychotic features such asdelusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder, and disorganized thinking. Negative symp-toms often become more severe, and patients are usually not able to care for themselves appro-priately. The stabilization (recovery) phase refers to a period of 6–18 months after acute treatment.During the stable phase, negative and residual positive symptoms that may be present are rel-atively consistent in magnitude and usually less severe than in the acute phase. Some patientsmay be asymptomatic whereas others experience nonpsychotic symptoms such as tension, anxi-ety, depression, or insomnia.
The period after recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and extending for up to the
subsequent 5 years is known as the early course. If patients experience further deterioration insymptoms and/or function, it is most likely to occur during this time, because by 5–10 years afteronset most patients experience a plateau in their level of illness and function (257, 643). Thisphase has also been termed “the critical period”  (679) because most follow-up studies have shown
that up to 80% of patients will have relapsed within this 5-year period (46). Before relapse occurs,there is usually a prodromal period in which nonpsychotic symptoms, followed by emotional dis-turbance and then frank psychotic symptoms develop over a period of about 4 weeks (680–682).
The long-term outcome of schizophrenia varies along a continuum between reasonable recov-
ery and total incapacity. About 10%–15% of persons with the disorder are free of further episodes(683), but the majority display exacerbations and remissions in the context of experiencing clin-ical deterioration, and about 10%–15% remain chronically severely psychotic (643, 684).
Several demographic and clinical variables have value in predicting long-term outcome. For
example, better outcomes are associated, on average, with female gender, family history of af-fective disorder, lack of family history of schizophrenia, good premorbid social and academicfunctioning, higher IQ, married marital status, later age of onset (685), acute onset with pre-cipitating stress, fewer prior episodes (both number and length), a phasic pattern of episodesand remissions, advancing age, minimal comorbidity, paranoid subtype, and symptoms thatare predominantly positive (delusions, hallucinations) and not disorganized (thought disorder,disorganized behavior) or negative (flat affect, alogia, avolition) (282, 303, 304, 502, 523, 660,661, 683, 686–692). It appears that the course is influenced by cultural factors and societalcomplexity, with better outcomes in developing countries (689).
The excessive mortality of patients with schizophrenia has been reported to be two to four
times that of the general population (34, 551, 656, 693–696). About 4%–10% of persons withschizophrenia die by suicide, and the rates are highest among males in the early course of thedisorder and in industrialized countries (387, 390, 697). Severe psychotic symptoms, depres-sion, comorbid substance use disorder, and adverse life events increase the risk of suicide in per-sons with schizophrenia (395, 698). Other major causes of death also include unnatural causes,such as accidents and traumatic injuries, and medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disor-ders and respiratory and infectious diseases (387).
/L50776 C. EPIDEMIOLOGY
The lifetime morbidity risk for schizophrenia (i.e., the proportion of a population meeting thecriteria for schizophrenia at any time during life provided they live through the entire age range

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 65of risk) is estimated to be 1.0% (699, 700) and appears to be the same for men and women up
to age 60 years (701, 702).
The incidence of schizophrenia appears to be stable across countries and cultures and over
time (701), although there is some controversy on this point, with some studies showing sig-nificant variability (703). In the World Health Organization (WHO) Determinants of Out-come Study, the median annual incidence of schizophrenia across eight participating WHOsites was 0.22 per 1,000 population (704). Earlier reports of declining incidence of schizophre-nia over time have not been confirmed (699, 700, 702).
The Epidemiologic Catchment Area study in the United States reported a lifetime preva-
lence rate of schizophrenia of 1.5% (705). Studies of representative community samples as-sessed by structured diagnostic interviews in the United States yield estimates of the lifetimeprevalence for schizophrenia of 0.7% (706).
Among persons age 65 years and older, the prevalence is probably 1% (528, 707, 708).
There are, however, controversies about whether early-onset and late-onset schizophrenia aredifferent or similar disorders.
About 20%–40% of patients experience their first psychotic symptoms before age 20 years
(709). For men, the peak incidence of onset of schizophrenia has been determined to be be-tween ages 15 and 25 years; for women, between ages 25 and 35 years (710). The WHO’s De-terminants of Outcome Study found a mean gender difference in age at onset of 3.4 years(711). Some studies (711–713), but not all (714), have demonstrated this earlier mean age ofonset in men across cultures. However, this finding may not be evident in familial schizophre-nia (715, 716). Women display a second peak of onset after age 40–45 years,  just before meno-
pause (674, 717–719).
Men experience more negative symptoms and women more affective symptoms (309),  al-
though acute psychotic symptoms, either in type or severity, do not differ between the two gen-ders (508, 720). The prevalence of negative (deficit) states in first-episode schizophrenia hasbeen estimated to be between 4% and 10% (298) and increases with the length of the schizo-phrenic illness (302–306, 661).
More than 80% of patients with schizophrenia have parents who do not have the disorder
(721). However, the risk of having schizophrenia is greater in persons whose parents have thedisorder; the lifetime risk is 13% for a child with one parent with schizophrenia and 35%–40%for a child with two affected parents (722). The risk increases with the number of affected rel-atives. T win studies have found a concordance rate among monozygotic twins of about 50%,compared to 9% for dizygotic twins and siblings (721, 723).
Many studies (724–729), but not all (730–732), have reported an association between ob-
stetric complications that involved fetal hypoxic brain damage and a subsequent increase in riskfor schizophrenia. Such complications include viral infection during pregnancy (733–738);first-trimester maternal starvation (739); rhesus incompatibility (740, 741); and maternalpreeclampsia (741–743), anemia (741, 743), and diabetes (743). Patients with an early onsetof schizophrenia were more likely to have a history of birth complications than those with lateronsets (744, 745). Persons born in the winter months are also at a higher risk (746–748).
Substance use has been associated with precipitation of symptoms of schizophrenia (334–
340, 667, 749, 750). The mean age at onset of schizophrenia as well as the age at first admissionwas lower in patients who had a history of substance use and higher in patients without such ahistory (341, 751).
Recent studies examining immigration and schizophrenia have shown an increase of the
disorder in second-generation African Caribbean immigrants in the United Kingdom (752–754). Other risk factors have been associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia (691,702). They include single marital status, a lower socioeconomic class (525), being raised in anurban environment (755, 756), environmental stress (525), and advanced paternal age (757,758).

66 APA Practice GuidelinesSchizophrenia is by far the most costly mental illness (759) and has been estimated to ac-
count for 2.5% of annual health care expenditures in the United States (760). The cost of
schizophrenia for American society was estimated to be $32.5 billion in 1990; by 1995, thecost was estimated to have escalated to $65 billion (761). Indirect costs to the patients, theirfamilies, other caregivers, and society must also be considered (762). In a British study, the an-nual indirect costs incurred through productivity loss by patients were estimated to be at leastfour times the direct costs (763).
V. REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS 
OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
/L50776 A. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS
This section is organized by medication. For each medication or medication class, the availabledata regarding efficacy are reviewed. Short-term efficacy has generally been measured by reduc-tions in psychopathology (positive, negative, affective, and general symptoms) among treatedpatients during 6- to 12-week medication trials. An advantage of studies that measure psy-chopathological changes is that they clearly demonstrate how well a medication can achieve areduction in the target symptoms. Less clear is how such reductions in symptoms relate to im-provements in patients’ functioning. Acute and long-term efficacy have also been assessed by ex-amining effects on cognitive function as measured by neurocognitive test performance (764–766), which in turn has been related to patients’ functional capacity and performance (767).
Long-term efficacy has usually been measured by reductions in either relapse or rehospital-
ization rates among treated patients and by levels of persisting or residual symptoms and gen-eral outcome over the course of several years. The utility of relapse rates depends on themeasure that is used. Relapse rates based on symptom reemergence have varied markedly fromstudy to study, partly because different criteria for the types and severity of symptoms have beenused to define relapse. Rehospitalization rates, which may also be used to determine rates ofrelapse, offer the advantage of reflecting both symptoms and functioning. However, rehospi-talization rates are affected by other clinical and nonclinical determinants. Thus, they tend tobe more conservative estimates of relapse (occurring at a rate of 1%–10% per month after dis-continuation of therapy) than are rates of reemergence of psychotic symptoms (5%–20% permonth) (99). More recently , long-term efficacy has been measured in terms of quality of life,health service utilization, and social and vocational function (768–771). In addition, thesemeasures of outcome have been used to define the level of recovery of patients.
1. Antipsychotic medications
In this guideline the term “antipsychotic” refers to multiple medications (Table 2), including thefirst-generation antipsychotic medications and the second-generation agents clozapine, risperi-done, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. In addition to having therapeuticeffects, both first- and second-generation antipsychotic agents can cause a broad spectrum ofside effects. Side effects of medications are a crucial aspect of treatment because they often de-termine medication choice and are a primary reason for medication discontinuation.
Side effects can complicate and undermine antipsychotic treatment in various ways. The
side effects themselves may cause or worsen symptoms associated with schizophrenia, includingnegative, positive, and cognitive symptoms and agitation (772). In addition, these side effects

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 67may contribute to risk for other medical disorders (50, 773). Finally, these side effects often are
subjectively difficult to tolerate and may affect the patient’s quality of life and willingness totake the medication (17).
Most side effects of antipsychotic treatment result from actions on neurotransmitter systems
and anatomic regions beyond those involved in mediating the intended therapeutic effects ofthe medication. Among the antipsychotic medications, differences in the risk of specific sideeffects are often predictable from the potencies and receptor binding profiles of the variousagents. Some side effects result from receptor-mediated effects within the central nervous sys-tem (e.g., extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, sedation) or outside the central nervoussystem (e.g., constipation, hypotension), whereas other side effects are of unclear pathophysiol-ogy (e.g., weight gain, hyperglycemia). Side effects that are similar across several classes ofagents, including both first- and second-generation antipsychotics, are discussed in SectionV .A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medications.” These shared side effects includeneurological effects (i.e., acute and chronic extrapyramidal effects, neuroleptic malignant syn-drome), sedation, cardiovascular effects (i.e., hypotension, tachycardia, and conduction abnor-malities), anticholinergic and antiadrenergic effects, weight gain and glucose and lipidmetabolic abnormalities, and sexual dysfunction. Side effects unique to particular agents arediscussed in the respective sections concerning those agents, as are other unique implementa-tion issues. Suggested approaches for monitoring and clinical management of the side effects ofantipsychotic medications are outlined in Table 1.
a) First-generation agents
First-generation antipsychotic agents effect their therapeutic action, as well as their extrapyra-midal side effects, primarily by blocking dopamine, subtype 2 (D
2), receptors in mesolimbo-
cortical and nigrostriatal areas of the brain (774).
(1) Efficacy in the acute phase
The evidence supporting the effectiveness of first-generation antipsychotic medications in re-ducing psychotic symptoms in acute schizophrenia comes from studies carried out in the 1960s(775, 776) as well as numerous subsequent clinical trials (99, 777). Each of these studies com-pared one or more antipsychotic medications with either placebo or a sedative agent, such asphenobarbital (778), that served as a control. Nearly all of these studies found that the anti-psychotic medication was superior for treating schizophrenia. These studies demonstrated theefficacy of first-generation antipsychotic medications for every subtype and subgroup of pa-tients with schizophrenia. Moreover, in reviews of studies that compared more than one first-generation antipsychotic medication, Klein and Davis (779) and Davis et al. (777) found that,with the exception of mepazine and promazine, all of these agents were equally effective, al-though there were differences in dose, potency, and side effects of the different drugs.
First-generation antipsychotic medications are effective in diminishing most symptoms of
schizophrenia. In a review of five large studies comparing an antipsychotic to placebo, Kleinand Davis (779) found that patients who received an antipsychotic demonstrated decreases inpositive symptoms, such as hallucinations, uncooperativeness, hostility, and paranoid ideation.Patients also showed improvement in thought disorder, blunted affect, withdrawal-retardation,and autistic behavior.
These findings—along with decades of clinical experience with these agents—indicate that
first-generation antipsychotic treatment can reduce the positive symptoms (hallucinations,delusions, bizarre behaviors) and secondarily reduce the negative symptoms (apathy, affectiveblunting, alogia, avolition) associated with schizophrenic psychosis (297). In placebo-con-trolled comparisons (99, 776), approximately 60% of patients treated with first-generationantipsychotic medication for 6 weeks improved to the extent that they achieved complete re-mission or experienced only mild symptoms, compared to only 20% of patients treated with

68 APA Practice Guidelinesplacebo. Forty percent of medication-treated patients continued to show moderate to severe
psychotic symptoms, compared to 80% of placebo-treated patients. Eight percent of medica-tion-treated patients showed no improvement or worsening, compared to nearly one-half ofplacebo-treated patients. A patient’s prior history of a medication response is a fairly reliablepredictor of how the patient will respond to a subsequent trial (780, 781).
Since the advent of second-generation antipsychotic medications, research on first-genera-
tion agents has reduced considerably. In recent years, randomized, controlled studies of the ef-ficacy of first-generation agents for acute treatment have focused on dosing strategies anddefining the most effective dose range to maximize symptom response and minimize side ef-fects. These studies have consistently found that modest doses of first-generation agents (typi-cally defined in haloperidol doses of less than 10 mg/day or plasma levels <18 ng/ml) are asefficacious or more efficacious than higher doses (782–784). Moderate doses of first-generationagents have been reported to improve comorbid depression (369, 785, 786), whereas higherdoses are associated with greater risk of extrapyramidal side effects and dysphoria (785, 787)and may be especially problematic for patients with frontal lobe dysfunction (788).
(2) Efficacy in the stabilization and stable phases
Empirical research provides relatively little guidance for psychiatrists who are making decisionsabout medication and dosage during the stabilization phase. The use of first-generation antip-sychotic medications during this phase is based on the clinical observation that patients relapseabruptly when medications are discontinued during this phase of treatment.
A large number of studies (789, 790) have compared relapse rates for stabilized patients who
continued taking a first-generation antipsychotic medication and for those whose regimen waschanged to placebo. During the first year only about 30% of those continuing to take medica-tions relapsed, compared with about 65% of those taking placebo. Even when adherence withmedication treatment was ensured by the use of long-acting injectable medications, as many as24% of patients relapsed in a year (791). Hogarty et al. (792) found that among outpatientsmaintained with antipsychotic medications for 2–3 years who had been stable and judged tobe at low risk of relapse, 66% relapsed in the year after medication withdrawal. Studies in whichthe medications of well-stabilized patients were discontinued indicate that 75% of patients re-lapse within 6–24 months (790). Among patients who have experienced a first episode ofschizophrenia, a number of carefully designed double-blind studies indicate that 40%–60% ofpatients relapse if they are untreated during the year after recovery from this initial episode(211, 212, 218).
A critical issue during the stable treatment phase is adherence to the medication regimen.
One strategy for improving adherence with first-generation agents is use of the long-acting in-jectable formulation. Studies with long-acting antipsychotics show a dose-response relationshipin prophylactic efficacy, although there is a tradeoff in the relationship between dose and re-lapse rate on the one hand and side effects on the other (793, 794). The higher the dose used,the lower the relapse rate but the higher the rate of side effects, whereas the reverse is seen withlower doses. Although a small number of randomized trials have assessed the effectiveness ofmore modest doses of long-acting injectable medications than those typically used in clinicalpractice, evidence on this question remains inconclusive. Inderbitzen et al. (795) found no lossof clinical effectiveness when the average dose of patients already receiving long-acting inject-able fluphenazine was cut gradually by 50% over a 5-month period (from an average of 23 mgevery 2 weeks to 11.5 mg every 2 weeks). Similarly, Carpenter et al. (796) found a regimen of25 mg of fluphenazine decanoate every 6 weeks to be equally effective as the same dose admin-istered every 2 weeks. However, Schooler et al. (219) compared three medication strategiesusing fluphenazine decanoate: a continuous moderate dose (12.5–50 mg every 2 weeks); a con-tinuous low dose (2.5–10 mg every 2 weeks); and targeted, early intervention (fluphenazineonly when the patient was experiencing symptoms). They found that both continuous low-dose

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 69and targeted treatment increased the use of rescue medication and the rate of relapse, while only
targeted treatment increased the rate of rehospitalization. 
(3) Shared side effects
Side effects of first-generation antipsychotic medications typically vary with the potency of theagent. High-potency first-generation antipsychotics are associated with a high risk of extra-pyramidal effects, a moderate risk of sedation, a low risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachy-cardia, and a low risk of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic effects. In contrast, low-potencyfirst-generation antipsychotic agents are associated with a lower risk of extrapyramidal effects,a high risk of sedation, a high risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, and a high riskof anticholinergic and antiadrenergic effects. Although other side effects also vary with the spe-cific medication, in general, the first-generation antipsychotic medications are associated witha moderate risk of weight gain, a low risk of metabolic effects, and a high risk of sexual sideeffects. With certain agents (thioridazine, mesoridazine, pimozide), a moderate risk of cardiacconduction abnormalities is also present. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome occurs rarely but islikely to be more often observed with first-generation agents (especially high-potency agents)than with second-generation antipsychotic medications. Details on the nature and manage-ment of each of these side effects are provided in Section V.A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Anti-psychotic Medications.”
(4) Other side effects
Other side effects include seizures, allergic reactions, and dermatological, hepatic, ophthalmo-logical, and hematological effects.
Seizures
First-generation antipsychotic medications can lower the seizure threshold and result in the de-velopment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (797). The low-potency first-generation anti-psychotic medications confer the greatest risk. The frequency of seizures with low-potencyantipsychotic medications is dose related, with higher doses associated with greater risk. At usualdose ranges, the seizure rates are below 1% for all first-generation antipsychotic medications, al-though patients with a history of an idiopathic or medication-induced seizure have a higher risk.
Allergic and dermatological effects
Cutaneous allergic reactions occur infrequently with first-generation antipsychotic medications.Medication discontinuation or administration of an antihistamine is usually effective in reversingthese symptoms. Rarely, thioridazine is associated with hyperpigmentation of the skin. Photosensi-tivity also occurs infrequently and is most common with the low-potency phenothiazine medica-tions; patients should be instructed to avoid excessive sunlight and use sunscreen (99).
Hepatic effects
Also occurring with this class of medications are elevation of liver enzyme levels and cholestaticjaundice. Jaundice has been noted to occur in 0.1%–0.5% of patients taking chlorpromazine(99). This side effect usually occurs within the first month after the initiation of treatment andgenerally requires discontinuation of treatment. However, given the relative infrequency ofantipsychotic-induced jaundice, other etiologies for jaundice should be evaluated before thecause is judged to be antipsychotic medication.
Ophthalmological effects
Pigmentary retinopathies and corneal opacities can occur with chronic administration of thelow-potency medications thioridazine and chlorpromazine, particularly at high doses (e.g.,more than 800 mg/day of thioridazine). For this reason, patients maintained with these medi-cations should have periodic ophthalmological examinations (approximately every 2 years for

70 APA Practice Guidelinespatients with a cumulative treatment of more than 10 years), and a maximum dose of 800 mg/
day of thioridazine is recommended (797). With the increased use of high-potency medica-tions in the past two decades, there has been virtually no reporting of this side effect (777).
Hematological effects
Hematological effects, including inhibition of le ukopoiesis, can occur with use of first-genera-
tion antipsychotic medications. Such effects include benign leukopenia and the more seriousagranulocytosis. The best data exist for chlorpromazine, with which benign leukopenia occursin up to 10% of patients and agranulocytosis occurs in 0.32% of patients (797).
(5) Implementation
Issues in implementation of treatment with first-generation antipsychotic medications includeroute of administration, dosage strategy, and medication interactions. 
Route of administration
First-generation antipsychotic medications can be administered in oral forms, as short-acting in-tramuscular preparations, or as long-acting injectable preparations. Short-acting intramuscularmedications reach a peak concentration 30–60 minutes after the medication is administered,whereas oral medications reach a peak in 2–3 hours (798). As a result, the calming effect of thefirst-generation antipsychotic may begin more quickly when the medication is administeredparenterally. However, this calming effect on agitation is different from the true antipsychotic ef-fect of these medications, which may require several days or weeks (779). It is also worth notingthat oral concentrates are typically better and more rapidly absorbed than pill preparations andoften approximate intramuscular administration in their time to peak serum concentrations.
A single or twice-daily dose of an oral preparation will result in steady-state blood levels in
2–5 days (798). Long-acting injectable first-generation antipsychotic medications (fluphena-zine decanoate or enanthate and haloperidol decanoate in the United States) may require up to3–6 months to reach a steady state (92). As a result, they are seldom used alone during acutetreatment, when the psychiatrist is adjusting the dose in accordance with therapeutic effectsand side effects.
The advantage of long-acting injectable medications has been best demonstrated in studies
such as those conducted by Johnson (799) under conditions that resemble most closely those incommunity clinics. In these studies, patients with histories of poor adherence were included inthe study population and the amount of contact between patients and staff was limited. In thelarger, more carefully controlled investigations (791, 800), patients with serious adherence prob-lems—that is, the patients most likely to benefit from treatment with long-acting injectablemedications—were commonly not included. Thus, a study by Hogarty et al. (800) showed areduction in relapse associated with fluphenazine decanoate compared to oral fluphenazine onlyafter 2 years of follow-up, as the effect of the drug on nonadherence and subsequent relapse tooktime to develop in a study population that was relatively stable and adherent at baseline.
Long-acting injectable medications are thought to be especially helpful in the stabilization
and stable phases. Janicak et al. (99) examined six studies that compared the risk of psychoticrelapse in patients who were randomly assigned to receive either oral or long-acting injectablemedication. The longest of those studies (800) lasted 2 years and showed a relapse rate of 65%for patients taking oral medication and a rate of 40% for patients taking long-acting injectablemedication. Although the remaining five studies, all of which lasted 1 year or less, had variableresults, a meta-analysis of all six studies showed a significantly lower relapse rate in patients whoreceived long-acting injectable medication (p<0.0002) (99).
Dosage strategy
The effective dose of a first-generation antipsychotic medication is closely related to its affinityfor dopamine receptors (particularly D
2 receptors) and its tendency to cause extrapyramidal side

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 71effects (801, 802). Thus, high-potency medications have a greater affinity for dopamine recep-
tors than do low-potency medications, and a much lower dose of high-potency medcations isrequired to treat psychosis. This relationship can be expressed in terms of dose equivalence(e.g., 100 mg of chlorpromazine has an antipsychotic effect that is similar to that of 2 mg ofhaloperidol). The dose equivalencies of commonly prescribed medications are listed in Table 2.
High-potency first-generation antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and fluphen-
azine, are more commonly prescribed than low-potency compounds (803). Although thesemedications have a greater tendency to cause extrapyramidal side effects than the low-potencymedications, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine, their side effects are easier to managethan the sedation and orthostatic hypotension associated with low-potency agents. High-potency medications can more safely be administered intramuscularly, since they seldom causehypotension. In addition, because of sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and lethargy, the doseof a low-potency medication should be increased gradually, whereas an adequate dose of a high-potency medication can usually be achieved within a day or two. Finding the optimal dose ofa first-generation antipsychotic is complicated by a number of factors. Patients with schizo-phrenia demonstrate large differences in the dose of first-generation antipsychotic they can tol-erate and the dose required for an antipsychotic effect. A patient’s age may influence theappropriate dose; elderly patients are more sensitive to both the therapeutic and adverse effectsof first-generation antipsychotics. In addition, in studies in which dose is not fixed, it is difficultto determine dose by assessing antipsychotic effectiveness, since it may take many days at a ther-apeutic dose before there is an appreciable decrease in psychosis (778, 780).
A number of studies (reviewed by Davis et al. [777] and by Baldessarini et al. [95]) provide
guidance about the usual doses required for acute treatment. Results of 19 controlled trials sug-gested that daily doses below 250 mg of chlorpromazine (or 5 mg of haloperidol or fluphena-zine) are less adequate for many acutely psychotic patients than are moderate doses, between 300and 600 mg of chlorpromazine. In the studies, response was typically measured by improvementin the score on the excitement, agitation, or psychosis subscale of the BPRS (6), and the propor-tions of patients responding to low doses after 1 and 2–10 days were 38% and 50%, respectively;these rates compared unfavorably with the improvement rates of 61% and 56% among patientstaking moderate doses for similar periods (95). Davis et al. (777) came to similar conclusions.They found that daily doses between 540 and 940 mg of chlorpromazine were optimal. Thefindings of clinical trials involve groups of patients; some patients have optimal responses at dos-es above or below these optimal ranges. Psychiatrists have treated acutely psychotic patients withhigh doses of high-potency first-generation antipsychotic medications during the first days oftreatment. This treatment is based on the belief that higher doses result in a more rapid improve-ment than that resulting from moderate doses (804). However, studies have revealed that highdaily doses (more than 800 mg of chlorpromazine equivalents daily) were no more effective, orfaster acting, on average than were moderate doses (500–700 mg/day) (95). After 1 day, 50% ofthe patients treated with high doses responded, compared to 61% of those who received mod-erate doses. After 2–10 days, high-dose treatment led to a slightly worse outcome: only 38% ofthose receiving high doses but 56% of those receiving moderate doses were improved. Thesestudies indicate that higher doses are no more effective for acute treatment than normal doses,but higher doses are associated with a greater incidence of side effects.
Controlled trials have provided similar information regarding the effect of medication dose
on outcome during the maintenance phase. In 33 randomized trials in which high doses (mean,5200 mg/day of chlorpromazine equivalents) were compared to low doses (mean, 400 mg/day)during maintenance treatment, the lower doses were more effective in improving clinical statein more than two-thirds of the trials (95). In addition, in 95% of the studies the higher dosesresulted in greater neurological side effects. Studies of doses of less than 200 mg/day of chlor-promazine equivalents tended to show that such doses were less effective than higher doses. Aninternational consensus conference (294) made the reasonable recommendation of a reduction

72 APA Practice Guidelinesin first-generation antipsychotic dose of approximately 20% every 6 months until a minimal
maintenance dose is reached. A minimal dose was considered to be as low as 2.5 mg of oralfluphenazine or haloperidol daily, 50 mg of haloperidol decanoate every 4 weeks, or 5 mg offluphenazine decanoate every 2 weeks.
Concerns about the side effects of first-generation antipsychotic medications during main-
tenance treatment and the risk of tardive dyskinesia led to several studies that focused on meth-ods for treating patients with the lowest effective maintenance dose. A number of investigators(19, 805–807) have studied gradual reductions in the amounts of medication given to stabi-lized patients until the medications are completely discontinued. Each patient was followedclosely until there were signs of the beginning of a relapse. At that time, the patient’s medica-tion was reinstituted. To make this strategy work, patients and their families were trained todetect the early signs of impending psychotic breakdown. This approach used antipsychoticmedications only intermittently to target symptom exacerbations and to avert anticipated ex-acerbations. Studies of the efficacy of this “targeted medication approach” have produced mixedresults, and this approach is not recommended because of the substantial increase in the risk ofrelapse (19, 219, 805, 806).
Another strategy involves using much lower doses of a long-acting injectable first-generation
antipsychotic than are usually prescribed. Several groups have compared low doses to moderateand high doses of fluphenazine decanoate. Initially, studies found that patients receiving verylow doses (mean=2.5 mg every 2 weeks) were significantly more likely to relapse over the courseof 1 year than were patients receiving standard doses (12.5–50.0 mg every 2 weeks) (56% versus7%) (794). A subsequent study demonstrated that patients given a slightly higher dose (2.5–10.0 mg every 2 weeks) showed a nonsignificant difference in relapse after 1 year, compared withpatients given standard doses (24% versus 14%) (808). Another study found no significant differ-ence in relapse after 1 year between patients who received low doses (mean=5 mg every 2 weeks)and those who received standard doses (25–50 mg every 2 weeks) but did detect a significantdifference in relapse rates after 2 years between the low-dose group and the standard-dose group(70% versus 35%) (793). Other studies, however, reported no difference in relapse rates after 2years between patients who received low doses (mean=3.8 mg every 2 weeks) and those who re-ceived standard doses (25 mg every 2 weeks) (809). However, Schooler et al. (219) found thatlow-dose fluphenazine decanoate (2.5–10 mg every 2 weeks) increased the relapse rate and the useof rescue medication, compared to a continuous moderate dose (12.5–50 mg every 2 weeks).Collectively, these studies indicate that doses of fluphenazine decanoate as low as 5–10 mg every2 weeks have been shown to be clinically effective, and some patients may respond to even lowerdoses, but the risk of relapse can increase significantly with these lower doses. However, consid-eration should be given to judicious reduction in the long-acting injectable dose over time, es-pecially for patients with adverse side effects, in order to evaluate the optimal dose.
In considering the use of low-dose, long-acting injectable first-generation antipsychotics,
the beneficial side effect profile associated with the use of lower doses should also be taken intoaccount. Kane et al. (794) found that low-dose users had fewer early signs of tardive dyskinesiaafter 1 year than did standard-dose users. In a study by Marder et al. (793), lower doses wereassociated with significantly less discomfort (as measured with the SCL-90-R [810]), psycho-motor retardation, and akathisia after 2 years. Hogarty et al. (809) reported that patients re-ceiving minimal doses had less muscle rigidity, akathisia, and other side effects at 1 year andhad greater improvements in instrumental and interpersonal role performances at 2 years.
First-generation antipsychotic medications have a very high therapeutic index for life-
threatening side effects (780). Consequently, overdoses rarely are fatal unless they are compli-cated by preexisting medical problems or concurrent ingestion of alcohol or other medications.Symptoms of overdose are generally characterized by exaggerations of the adverse effects, withrespiratory depression and hypotension presenting the greatest danger. T reatment is symptom-atic and supportive and includes 1) ensuring airway patency and maintenance of respiration;

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 732) orally administering activated charcoal to decrease absorption and considering gastric lavage;
3) maintaining blood pressure with intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents; and 4) adminis-tering anticholinergic agents if needed to counteract extrapyramidal signs (811).
Medication interactions
A number of medication interactions can have clinically important effects for patients who aretreated with antipsychotic medications (48, 49, 812). Certain heterocyclic antidepressants, mostSSRIs, some beta-blockers, and cimetidine may increase antipsychotic plasma levels and in-crease side effects. On the other hand, barbiturates and carbamazepine decrease plasma levelsthrough effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes.
b) Second-generation agents
The medications discussed in this section are referred to as second-generation antipsychoticsprimarily because the doses that are effective against the psychopathology of schizophrenia donot cause extrapyramidal side effects. Their therapeutic effects are attributed to central antag-onism of both serotonin and dopamine receptors and also possibly to relatively loose bindingto D
2 receptors (813–815).
ClozapineClozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with antagonist activity at numerous recep-tors, including dopamine (D
1, D2, D3, D4, D5), serotonin (5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C),
muscarinic (M 1, M 2, M 3, M 5), α1- and α2-adrenergic, and histamine (H 1) receptors (816–
818). Clozapine is an agonist at muscarinic (M 4) receptors (819). Clozapine is also distin-
guished from other antipsychotic medications by its greater efficacy in treating positive symp-toms in patients with treatment-resistant illness and by the absence of extrapyramidal sideeffects. However, it is associated with several serious and potentially fatal adverse effects, includ-ing agranulocytosis in 0.5%–1% of patients, seizures in about 2% of patients, and rare occur-rences of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.
Efficacy of clozapine
Clozapine has demonstrated superior efficacy for the treatment of general psychopathology in pa-tients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, compared to the first-generation antipsychotics ha-loperidol and chlorpromazine in six of eight published double-blind randomized trials (313, 314,769, 820–824). A meta-analysis pooled the results of five of these studies that categorically de-fined subjects as “responders” based on clinically meaningful improvement in psychopathologyand found that clozapine-treated patients were 2.5 times more likely to meet response criteriathan those treated with a first-generation antipsychotic (p=0.001) (87). Clozapine also has dem-onstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a ran-domized 2-year study of 980 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at high riskfor suicide because of previous or current suicidal ideation or behavior (55). In this study patientswere randomly assigned to receive either clozapine or olanzapine. Fewer patients who receivedclozapine attempted suicide (34 subjects), compared to patients who received olanzapine (55 sub-jects) (p=0.03), and a 24% reduction in risk of suicidal behaviors was found. In light of this evi-dence, clozapine should be preferentially considered for patients with a history of chronic andpersistent suicidal ideation or behaviors. In addition, several studies suggest that clozapine mayreduce the severity of hostility and aggression in patients with treatment-resistant symptoms (57,314, 440, 821, 825–827). Open-label and double-blind studies of clozapine have produced in-consistent results with regard to effects on cognition, with some measures showing improvementand others showing no changes or even decrements in performance (828–840).
There is also preliminary evidence from open-label observational studies that clozapine may
reduce risk of relapse in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (841–845). Althoughthese studies are encouraging, they are limited since some included only clozapine responders,

74 APA Practice Guidelineswhile others did not include a comparison group. These studies are supported by the results of
a large randomized open trial, in which significantly fewer hospital readmissions were observedfor patients treated with clozapine, compared to those treated with usual care in a state hospitalsystem over a 2-year period (822). The only double-blind study that measured readmissionrates over a 1-year period failed to show a difference between haloperidol and clozapine for pa-tients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although patients treated with clozapine stayedfewer days in the hospital (769). T aken together, the evidence is suggestive that treatment withclozapine is associated with reduced rates of relapse and rehospitalization in patients with treat-ment-resistant schizophrenia.
Studies of other populations, including patients with first-episode schizophrenia (846) and
patients with treatment-responsive schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (847), demonstrateonly limited or inconsistent superior efficacy for clozapine. In addition, studies comparing cloza-pine to other second-generation antipsychotics generally show comparable efficacy of clozapinewith other second-generation antipsychotics (87, 381, 820, 848). However, since relatively lowdoses of clozapine were used in these studies, the results must be interpreted with caution.
In summary, a clozapine trial should be considered for patients who have shown a poor re-
sponse to other antipsychotic medications. Clozapine may also be considered for patients witha history of chronic and persistent suicidal ideation or behaviors. In addition, clozapine mayalso be considered for patients with persistent hostility and aggression, given that superior ef-ficacy of clozapine has been demonstrated in these patient populations.
Shared side effects of clozapine
Clozapine is associated with a very low risk of acute and chronic extrapyramidal side effects, ahigh risk of sedation, a high risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a low risk of car-diac conduction abnormalities, a high risk of anticholinergic effects, a high risk of weight gainand metabolic abnormalities, and a low risk of prolactin elevation and sexual side effects.Neuroleptic malignant syndrome occurs rarely with clozapine. Details on the nature and man-agement of each of these side effects are provided in Section V.A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Anti-psychotic Medications.”
Other side effects of clozapine
Sialorrhea and drooling occur relatively frequently and are most likely due to decreased salivaclearance related to impaired swallowing mechanisms (849), or possibly as a result of muscar-inic cholinergic antagonist activity at the M
4 receptor or to α-adrenergic agonist activity (850).
Interventions include use of a towel on the pillow at night to reduce discomfort. While thereis little systematic information about pharmacological interventions, case reports suggest po-tential improvement with antimuscarinic agents and α receptor agonists (851–853). However,
since clozapine also exhibits significant anticholinergic properties, use of agents with added an-ticholinergic effects must be approached with extreme caution to avoid potential adverse effectssuch as constipation or cognitive impairment.
Fever (>38 °C) may occur during the first few weeks of treatment (854, 855). Generally a
clozapine-associated fever is self-limiting and responds to supportive measures. However, feveris a symptom of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agranulocytosis, and cardiomyopathy, andthe presence of fever warrants evaluation for these potentially life-threatening complications ofclozapine treatment.
The risk of agranulocytosis (defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm
3)
has been estimated at 1.3% of patients per year of treatment with clozapine (99, 854, 856).The risk is highest in the first 6 months of treatment, and therefore weekly WBC and neutro-phil monitoring is required. After 6 months, monitoring may occur every 2 weeks, as the riskof agranulocytosis appears to diminish considerably (an estimated rate of three cases per 1,000patients). WBC counts must remain above 3000/mm
3 during clozapine treatment, and abso-
lute neutrophil counts must remain above 1500/mm3.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 75In the United States through 1989 there were 149 cases of agranulocytosis, with 48 (32%)
fatalities. With the advent of systematic monitoring, fatalities have been greatly reduced (857–
859). Between 1989 and 1997, among the 150,409 patients treated with clozapine who wereincluded in the patient registry maintained by the U.S. manufacturer of the drug, 585 cases ofagranulocytosis, with nine fatalities, were reported. Thus, awareness of agranulocytosis and themonitoring system have decreased the reported rate of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis toless than 0.5%.
Reports of myocarditis, with resultant cardiomyopathy and fatal heart failure, associated
with clozapine use suggest a 17- to 322-fold elevation in risk in clozapine-treated patients. Theabsolute risk is estimated to range from 1 per 500 treated patients (860) to 1 per 10,000 treatedpatients (861). An immune mechanism mediated by immunoglobulin E antibodies is suspectedbecause of reports of associated eosinophilia. Most but not all cases have occurred early in treat-ment, suggesting that the risk of myocarditis may be less after the first few months.
Clozapine is also associated with a dose-related risk of seizures (854). The overall seizure rate
is 2.8%; with low-dose treatment (<300 mg/day) the risk is 1%, with medium doses (300–599mg/day) the risk is 2.7%, and with high doses (>599 mg/day) the risk is 4.4%. The seizure riskfor clozapine is also related to rapid increases in dose. Therefore, the rate of titration should notexceed the guidelines described in the subsequent section on implementation of treatment withclozapine.
In addition, there are case reports associating clozapine treatment with several other rare but
potentially serious adverse events, including pancreatitis (862, 863), deep vein thrombosis(864, 865), pulmonary embolism, hepatitis (866, 867), and eosinophilia (863). Because of thesmall number of reports, the causal relationship with clozapine is unclear.
Implementation of treatment with clozapine
Before initiating treatment with clozapine, a complete blood count (CBC) with differentialshould be performed and the patient’s general and cardiovascular health status should be eval-uated. The cardiovascular side effects of clozapine should be considered in planning treatmentfor patients with preexisting heart disease. T reatment should be initiated at a low dose (12.5–25 mg once or twice daily) and increased gradually (by no more than 25–50 mg/day) as toler-ated until a target dose is reached. Because of the risk of marked hypotension, sedation, andseizures with rapid dose escalation, dose titration should not occur more rapidly. During dosetitration the patient’s cardiovascular status, including orthostatic pulse, blood pressure, andsubjective complaints of dizziness, should be monitored. Since the side effects of clozapine inthe initial and dose-adjustment phases may be severe in some patients, admission to the hospitalmay be justifiable (e.g., for unstable patients who require rapid dose increases to a therapeutic lev-el, patients with a limited social support system, or patients prone to orthostatic hypotension orseizures).
Adequate safety monitoring during treatment is important to minimize the risk of adverse
events. The clozapine package label states that WBC and neutrophil counts should be evaluat-ed before treatment is initiated, weekly during the first 6 months of treatment and at least every2 weeks after 6 months of treatment (854). Clozapine treatment should not be initiated if theinitial WBC count is <3500/mm
3, if the patient has a history of a myeloproliferative disorder,
or if the patient has a history of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia.
With maintenance treatment, patients should be advised to report any sign of infection im-
mediately (e.g., sore throat, fever, weakness, lethargy). A WBC count <2000/mm3 or absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/mm3 indicates impending or actual agranulocytosis, and the
clinician should stop clozapine treatment immediately, check WBC and differential counts dai-ly, monitor for signs of infection, and consider bone marrow aspiration and protective isolationif granulopoiesis is deficient. A WBC count of 2000–3000/mm
3 or ANC of 1000–1500/mm3
indicates high risk of or impending agranulocytosis, and the clinician should stop clozapine

76 APA Practice Guidelinestreatment immediately, check the WBC and differential counts daily, and monitor for signs of
infection. Clozapine may be resumed if no infection is present, the WBC count rises to >3000,and the ANC is >1500 (resume checking WBC count twice a week until it is >3500). If theWBC count is 3000–3500/mm
3, if it falls to 3000/mm3 over 1–3 weeks, or if immature WBC
forms are present, repeat the WBC count with a differential count. If the subsequent WBCcount is 3000–3500/mm
3 and the ANC is >1500/mm3, repeat the WBC count with a differ-
ential count twice a week until the WBC count is >3500/mm3.
Agranulocytosis is usually reversible if clozapine is discontinued immediately (868). When
agranulocytosis develops, clozapine should be immediately discontinued, and patients shouldbe given intensive treatment for the secondary complications, e.g., sepsis. Granulocyte colonystimulating factor has been used to accelerate granulopoietic function and shorten recoverytime (869). Lithium has also been considered as a possible treatment for leukopenia or to pre-vent the development of agranulocytosis in patients who may be susceptible to this adverse ef-fect (870, 871).
Although there have been reports of successful clozapine rechallenge after leukopenia, the
risk of recurrence remains high (872). A rechallenge with clozapine should not be undertakenin patients with confirmed cases of agranulocytosis (ANC <500/mm
3), as recurrence is almost
certain (872). Clinically, rechallenge should only be considered for patients whose WBC countremained greater than 2000/mm
3, whose absolute neutrophil count remained greater than
1500/mm3, and for whom trials with multiple other antipsychotics had failed but a good clin-
ical response to clozapine was shown.
In addition, patients should be monitored for weight gain, glucose abnormalities, and hy-
perlipidemias that may occur during treatment with clozapine. Table 1 outlines suggestedmonitoring and clinical management of such adverse effects. Patients should also be monitoredfor other potentially life-threatening adverse effects of clozapine, including fever and othersigns of myocarditis. Patients should be advised to report any signs of myocarditis (e.g., fever,fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, respiratory distress, peripheral edema). Immedi-ate clinical evaluation is warranted, and a cardiovascular evaluation is needed if these symptomsare not explained by other causes. A cardiac evaluation is thus recommended for clozapine-treated patients who experience unexplained fever, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, tachycar-dia, hypotension, narrowed pulse pressure, respiratory distress, peripheral edema, ST-T waveabnormalities or arrhythmias as shown by ECG, or hypereosinophilia as shown by a CBC, es-pecially if these symptoms are experienced during the first few months of treatment (873).
Controlled trials provide only limited guidance regarding the optimal dose of clozapine for
schizophrenia. Since there have been no trials in which patients were randomly assigned to dif-ferent doses of clozapine, the only available data are based on studies in which psychiatrists usedwhat they considered the most effective dose. Fleischhacker et al. (874) reviewed 16 controlledtrials from Europe and the United States. The mean dose from the European trials was 283.7mg/day, and the U.S. mean was 444 mg/day. Plasma levels may help guide dosing, with studiessuggesting that maximal clinical efficacy may be achieved when plasma levels of clozapine arebetween 200 and 400 ng/ml (typically associated with a dose of 300–400 mg/day) (875–878).
Although most patients whose symptoms respond to clozapine demonstrate maximal clin-
ical improvement during the first 6–12 weeks of treatment, clinical benefits may continue todevelop after 6–12 months (87, 879, 880). T welve-week empirical trials of clozapine appear tobe adequate to determine whether a patient is likely to respond to this medication (881, 882).
The elimination half-life of clozapine is approximately 12 hours, indicating that patients are
likely to reach a steady-state plasma concentration after 2–3 days (883). Clozapine is metabo-lized primarily by the CYP1A2 enzyme. Other liver enzymes also contribute to clozapinemetabolism, including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Coadministration of drugs thatinhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., cimetidine, caffeine, erythromycin, fluvoxamine, flu-oxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) may lead to a significant increase in clozapine plasma levels;

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 77inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., phenytoin, nicotine, rifampin) can significantly reduce clozapine
levels. In particular, changes in smoking status may affect clozapine levels (500, 884). The con-comitant use of medications such as carbamazepine can lower the WBC count and increase thepotential danger of agranulocytosis; such medications should therefore be avoided. Some casesof respiratory or cardiac arrest have occurred among patients receiving benzodiazepines or oth-er psychoactive medications concomitantly with clozapine. While no specific interaction be-tween clozapine and benzodiazepines has been established, judicious use is advised whenbenzodiazepines or other psychotropic medications are administered with clozapine (885).
Risperidone
Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic with antagonist activity at dopamine (D
1,
D2, D3, D4), serotonin (5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C), α1- and α 2-adrenergic, and histamine
(H1) receptors (816, 817).
Efficacy of risperidoneThere are numerous published clinical trials comparing the acute efficacy of risperidone withplacebo, first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol or perphenazine), and other second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizo-phreniform disorder. Placebo-controlled studies consistently demonstrate that for acutely re-lapsed patients, risperidone is efficacious in the treatment of global psychopathology and thepositive symptoms of schizophrenia (886–888), as well as in increasing the likelihood of clini-cal response (e.g., ≥20% improvement on rating scales of global psychopathology). There is lessconsistent evidence that negative symptoms improve with risperidone treatment, as significantimprovement compared with placebo was not found at all doses of risperidone (886, 887, 889).It is likely that the improvements in negative symptoms are due to the decreased likelihood ofsecondary negative symptoms (e.g., related to parkinsonism or to psychosis). Active-compara-tor-controlled studies demonstrate comparable or occasionally greater likelihood of clinical re-sponse and improvement of global psychopathology and positive symptoms with risperidone,compared with haloperidol (886, 887, 890–894) and perphenazine (895). Meta-analyses ofthese studies suggest that risperidone may have modestly better efficacy, compared with halo-peridol and perphenazine, in decreasing positive symptoms (889, 896, 897) and global psycho-pathology and increasing the likelihood of response (82, 86, 88, 89, 889, 898–900). Thesestudies also show less consistent evidence that negative symptoms improve with risperidonetreatment, with any improvements possibly due to the decreased likelihood of secondary neg-ative symptoms or resulting from comparison with high doses of first-generation antipsychoticagents. One study (271) found risperidone to have similar efficacy to haloperidol in the acutetreatment of first-episode schizophrenia, as measured by greater response rates, improvementin global psychopathology, and improvement in positive symptoms.
Several studies have examined the efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of neurocognitive
deficits of schizophrenia. Generally, these studies find that global measures of neurocognitivefunction improved with risperidone, although the magnitude of improvement was similar tothat observed with haloperidol in two studies (901, 902). However, in one 14-week trial thatincluded 101 patients, treatment with risperidone resulted in statistically significantly greaterimprovement in global neurocognition, compared with haloperidol (838). The clinical signif-icance of this effect, however, is unclear. Thus, further investigation is required to determinethe magnitude and clinical significance of risperidone effects on neurocognition.
Several studies have examined the efficacy of risperidone in patients with treatment-resistant
schizophrenia. In an 8-week double-blind study, risperidone (mean dose=7.5 mg/day, N=34) andhaloperidol (mean dose=19.4 mg/day, N=33) demonstrated similar efficacy in the treatment ofglobal psychopathology (903). In a 14-week double-blind trial, treatment with risperidone (meandose=11.6 mg/day, N=41) resulted in significant improvement in global psychopathology scores

78 APA Practice Guidelinesbut not in positive and negative symptom subscale scores, for which the effects of risperidone were
comparable to those of haloperidol (mean dose=25.7 mg/day, N=37) (820). In a 12-week double-blind study, 6 mg/day of risperidone (N=39) was superior to 20 mg/day of haloperidol (N=39)in the treatment of global psychopathology and negative symptoms (904).
Studies comparing risperidone to other second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment
of acute episodes have generally found similar efficacy for treatment of psychopatholgy both inpatients with treatment-responsive illness and in those with treatment-resistant illness (848,902, 905–907).
Compared with haloperidol, risperidone has demonstrated superior efficacy in the preven-
tion of relapse in the maintenance phase of treatment. In a study of 397 stable patients withDSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, haloperidol-treated patients (mean dose=11.7 mg/day) were 1.93 times more likely to relapse than risperidone-treated patients (meandose=4.9 mg/day) during the 1-year follow-up period (382). In this study, the risperidone-treat-ed patients also had significantly greater improvement in global psychopathology, compared tothe haloperidol-treated patients.
Shared side effects of risperidone
Risperidone is associated with a low risk of sedation, a low to moderate risk of extrapyramidalside effects, a moderate risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a low risk of anticho-linergic effects, a moderate risk of weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, and a high risk ofprolactin elevation and sexual side effects. Risperidone slightly alters cardiac conduction butnot to a clinically meaningful extent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome occurs rarely with ris-peridone. Details on the nature and management of each of these side effects are provided inSection V .A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medications.”
Other side effects of risperidone
Clinical trial data suggest a small increase in the risk of stroke in patients with dementia treatedwith risperidone, compared with placebo-treated patients. Thus, dementia patients treatedwith risperidone should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of stroke (908). Similarincreases in risk of stroke have not been reported in elderly risperidone-treated patients withschizophrenia who do not have dementia.
Implementation of treatment with risperidone
While the original efficacy studies comparing different doses of risperidone indicated optimaleffectiveness at doses of around 6 mg/day, clinical investigations and subsequent studies indi-cate that for most adult patients optimal doses are between 2 and 6 mg/day, with a minority ofpatients requiring higher doses. Higher doses often lead to extrapyramidal side effects withoutgreater effectiveness. Patients who develop parkinsonian symptoms are probably receiving toohigh a dose, and dose reduction is required for these patients.
During the titration and early treatment phase, risperidone-treated patients should be mon-
itored for extrapyramidal side effects, orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia, side effectsassociated with prolactin elevation, and sedation. In addition, patients should be monitored forweight gain, glucose abnormalities, and hyperlipidemias that may occur during treatment withrisperidone. Table 1 outlines suggested strategies for monitoring and clinical management ofsuch adverse effects. Elderly patients, particularly those with dementia, should be monitoredfor signs and symptoms of stroke.
Risperidone’s effectiveness appears to be related to actions of both the parent compound and
a major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone (909). They are therapeutically equipotent, havesimilar types of pharmacological activity, and, therefore, probably produce similar therapeuticeffects. Although risperidone itself has an elimination half-life of only 3 hours, its metabolitehas an elimination half-life of about 24 hours. As a result, most patients can be managed with

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 79a once-daily dose of risperidone. However, since risperidone can cause orthostatic hypotension,
twice-daily dosing may be useful during the titration phase and for patients who may be vul-nerable to orthostatic changes, such as elderly patients.
Risperidone is primarily metabolized by the hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme into the 9-hydrox-
yrisperidone metabolite (910). 9-Hydroxyrisperidone may also be metabolized by the CYP3A4liver enzyme (500, 911). As a result, inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease risperidone blood levelsand thus reduce therapeutic efficacy (912). In contrast, inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4may raise blood levels of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone and thusproduce increased side effects, such as extrapyramidal side effects (913). In 5%–8% of Cauca-sians and 2%–5% of African Americans and Asians, the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme is verylow or absent. In poor metabolizers, the half-life is 17 hours for risperidone and 30 hours for9-hydroxyrisperidone, compared to half-lives in extensive metabolizers of 3 hours for risperi-done and 21 hours for 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Thus, the relative proportion of risperidone to9-hydroxyrisperidone will be higher in patients who are slow metabolizers. In addition, drugsthat inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme (e.g., quinidine) will effectively turn extensive metabolizersinto poor metabolizers. In terms of CYP liver enzymes other than CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, ris-peridone does not tend to produce significant inhibition or induction.
Olanzapine
Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with antagonist activity at dopamine (D
1, D2,
D3, D4), serotonin (5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C), muscarinic (M 1, M2, M3, M5), α1-adrenergic, and his-
tamine (H 1) receptors (818, 914).
Efficacy of olanzapineThere are several published clinical trials comparing the acute efficacy of olanzapine with placebo,first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol or chlorpromazine), and other second-generationantipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophreniformdisorder. Placebo-controlled studies consistently demonstrate that in acutely relapsed patientsolanzapine is efficacious in treating global psychopathology and the positive symptoms ofschizophrenia, as well as in increasing the likelihood of clinical response (e.g., ≥20% improve-
ment on rating scales of global psychopathology) (915–917). The evidence that negative symp-toms improve with olanzapine treatment, compared with placebo, is less consistently foundacross doses of the drug (915–917). It is likely that any improvements in negative symptomsin these studies are due to decreased likelihood of secondary negative symptoms (e.g., relatedto parkinsonism or to psychosis) rather than to direct effects on primary negative symptoms(323). Active-comparator-controlled studies demonstrate similar or occasionally greater likeli-hood of clinical response and greater improvement of global psychopathology and positive andnegative symptoms with olanzapine, compared to haloperidol (279, 319, 916–920). Meta-analyses of these studies suggest that olanzapine may have modestly better efficacy, comparedwith haloperidol, in the treatment of global psychopathology and positive and negative symp-toms (921) and in increasing the likelihood of response (82, 86, 88). Effects on hostility aremixed, with one study (921) showing greater improvement in hostility with olanzapine thanwith haloperidol, and another study finding no difference in hostility response (440). In pa-tients with a first episode of schizophrenia, one study (a subanalysis of a Lilly olanzapine data-base) found significantly greater improvement in global psychopathology, positive and negativesymptoms, and response rate after a 6-week trial of olanzapine, compared to haloperidol (272).A second study found that a significantly larger proportion of olanzapine-treated patients,compared with haloperidol-treated patients, remained in the trial and completed the first 12weeks of treatment (279). In addition, the study found that the olanzapine-treated patients hadslight but significant improvements in global psychopathology and negative symptoms andwere more likely to meet the response criteria, although this difference only approached signif-icance (p=0.06).

80 APA Practice GuidelinesFour studies have examined the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of neurocognitive
deficits of schizophrenia. Two of these studies found significant improvement in neurocogni-
tion as measured by a global index in olanzapine-treated patients, compared to haloperidol-treated patients (838, 902). One 12-week analysis of treatment effects in first-episode patientsfound significant improvement with olanzapine, compared to haloperidol, in global neurocog-nition assessed with a measure derived from a principal-component analysis, but the differenceonly approached significance when an empirically derived a priori measure of global neurocog-nition was used (922). The fourth study did not find differences between haloperidol and olan-zapine in effects on global neurocognition (923). Olanzapine significantly improved motorfunction (838, 902), verbal fluency, nonverbal fluency and construction, immediate recall(902), general executive function (838, 923), and perceptual function and attention (838). Al-though a relatively consistent finding is that olanzapine has beneficial effects on neurocogni-tion in schizophrenia, findings for the specific domains affected and the clinical significance ofthese effects are less clear. Further study is needed to determine the magnitude and clinical sig-nificance of the effects of olanzapine on neurocognition.
Several studies have examined the efficacy of olanzapine in patients with treatment-resistant
illness (i.e., patients who have shown little or no response to adequate trials of other antipsy-chotics). In an 8-week double-blind study, 25 mg/day of olanzapine (N=42) and 1200 mg/dayof chlorpromazine (N=39) demonstrated similar efficacy in the treatment of global psychopa-thology (924). In a 14-week double-blind trial, treatment with a mean dose of 30.4 mg/day ofolanzapine (N=39) resulted in significantly greater improvement in global psychopathologyand negative symptoms, compared with a mean dose of 25.7 mg/day of haloperidol (N=37)(820). A third study that used a Lilly clinical trial database to retrospectively identify patientswithout response to first-generation antipsychotics found that olanzapine-treated patients,compared to haloperidol-treated patients, had significantly greater improvements in global psy-chopathology and positive, negative, and mood symptoms; higher response rates; and highercompletion rates (925). Although higher doses of olanzapine (doses up to 60 mg/day) are beingused clinically for patients with treatment-resistant illness, current evidence of improved effi-cacy at higher doses is inconclusive (820, 926, 927).
Studies comparing olanzapine to other second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of
acute episodes have generally found similar efficacy for treatment of psychopathology both in pa-tients with treatment-responsive symptoms and in those with treatment-resistant symptoms (381,820, 905, 906), with some exceptions in which olanzapine was found to be superior (820, 902).
In terms of treatment during the stabilization and stable phases, analysis of data from the
double-blind extension phase of 6-week acute treatment trials suggests that olanzapine may re-duce the risk of relapse, compared to haloperidol. Pooling data across three studies, the inves-tigators found that 19.7% of olanzapine-treated patients relapsed during the 1-year follow-upperiod, compared to 28% of haloperidol-treated patients (p<0.04) (928).
Shared side effects of olanzapine
Olanzapine is associated with a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects, a low risk of sedation, alow risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a low risk of cardiac conduction abnormali-ties, a moderate risk of anticholinergic effects, a high risk of weight gain and metabolic abnormal-ities, and a low risk of prolactin elevation and sexual side effects. Neuroleptic malignant syndromeoccurs rarely with olanzapine. Details on the nature and management of each of these side effectsare provided in Section V.A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medications.”
Implementation of treatment with olanzapine
Olanzapine is an effective antipsychotic when administered in doses of 10–20 mg/day in theacute phase of schizophrenia, although higher doses, up to 60 mg/day, have been reported tobe used for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (820, 926, 927). With the possibleexception of akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms are infrequent at any dose of olanzapine.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 81During the titration and early treatment phase olanzapine-treated patients should be mon-
itored for extrapyramidal side effects, orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia, and seda-
tion. Orthostatic hypotension may be more likely if benzodiazepines are coadministered (929).Evening administration may improve tolerance of the sedation that is common early in treat-ment. In addition, patients should be monitored for weight gain, glucose abnormalities, andhyperlipidemias that may occur during treatment with olanzapine. Table 1 outlines suggestedmonitoring and clinical management of such adverse effects.
Patients are typically managed with a single daily dose of olanzapine since the elimination
half-life of olanzapine is 33 hours (ranging from 21 to 54 hours) (929). Olanzapine is primarilymetabolized by the hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme, with a minor metabolic pathway involving theCYP2D6 enzyme. Inducers of the CYP1A2 enzyme (such as tobacco use) may reduce olanza-pine plasma levels, and so changes in smoking status may affect efficacy and side effects at a givendose (500). There is some evidence to suggest differential metabolism of olanzapine by gender,with women exhibiting higher plasma concentrations than men at equivalent doses (509).
Quetiapine
Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with antagonist activity at dopamine (D
1,
D2), serotonin (5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C), α1-adrenergic, and histamine (H 1) receptors
(818, 930).
Efficacy of quetiapine
There are several published clinical trials comparing the acute efficacy of quetiapine with thatof placebo, first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol or chlorpromazine), and other second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizo-phreniform disorder. Placebo-controlled studies consistently demonstrate that in acutely re-lapsed patients quetiapine is efficacious in the treatment of global psychopathology, inimproving the likelihood of clinical response (e.g., ≥20% improvement on rating scales of glo-
bal psychopathology), and in improving the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (318, 931,932). The evidence that negative symptoms improve with quetiapine treatment is less clear, assignificant improvement with quetiapine, compared with placebo, is less consistently foundacross different doses of the drug and different studies (318, 931, 932). It is likely that the im-provements in negative symptoms in these studies are due to decreased likelihood of secondarynegative symptoms (e.g., related to parkinsonism or to psychosis) rather than to direct effectson primary negative symptoms. Active-comparator-controlled studies demonstrate compara-ble or occasionally greater improvement of global psychopathology and positive and negativesymptoms, as well as an increased likelihood of clinical response with quetiapine, compared tohaloperidol or chlorpromazine (933–935). Meta-analyses of these studies suggest that the effi-cacy of quetiapine is similar to that of first-generation antipsychotics (82, 86, 88).
In terms of relapse prevention, one 4-month randomized, open-label study compared the
efficacy of quetiapine (mean dose=254 mg/day, N=553) to that of risperidone (mean dose=4.4mg/day, N=175) (907). This study found both antipsychotics to have similar effects on globalpsychopathology and positive symptoms and negative symptoms, with marginally significantgreater improvement in depressive symptoms in the quetiapine-treated patients. While thisstudy lends preliminary evidence for the efficacy of quetiapine in preventing relapse, furtherstudies using blinded methods are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.
One study compared the efficacy of 600 mg/day of quetiapine (N=143) to that of 20 mg/
day of haloperidol (N=145) in patients with treatment-resistant illness and found that a signif-icantly greater proportion of the quetiapine-treated patients met the response criteria (52%,compared to 38% of the haloperidol-treated patients) (936). However, the mean changes inglobal psychopathology, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms were similar for bothgroups.

82 APA Practice GuidelinesT wo studies found beneficial effects on neurocognition for quetiapine, compared to first-
generation antipsychotics. In a 6-month randomized, double-blind study, significant improve-
ment in global cognition, verbal reasoning and fluency, and immediate recall was found forsubjects treated with 300–600 mg/day of quetiapine (N=13) but not for subjects treated with10–20 mg/day of haloperidol (N=12) (937). Similarly, in a 24-week double-blind, randomizedstudy, significantly greater improvement in global cognition, executive function, attention, andverbal memory was found for subjects treated with 600 mg/day of quetiapine, compared tosubjects treated with 12 mg/day of haloperidol (938).
Shared side effects of quetiapine
Quetiapine is associated with a very low risk of extrapyramidal side effects, a high risk of seda-tion, a moderate risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a low risk of cardiac conduc-tion abnormalities, a low risk of anticholinergic effects, a moderate risk of weight gain andmetabolic abnormalities, and a low risk of prolactin elevation and sexual side effects. Neuro-leptic malignant syndrome occurs rarely with quetiapine. Details on the nature and managementof each of these side effects are provided in Section V.A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of AntipsychoticMedications.”
Other side effects of quetiapine
Preclinical studies in beagles found associations between quetiapine and increased risk of cata-racts, prompting the FDA to suggest routine screening ophthalmological examinations beforeand every 6 months during quetiapine treatment. This risk has not been confirmed in humans,and there is no indication from postmarketing reporting of an association between increasedcataract risk and quetiapine use (939).
Implementation of treatment with quetiapine
Quetiapine is an effective antipsychotic when administered in doses of 300–800 mg/day in theacute phase of schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that the higher doses in this range (and perhapsdoses greater than 800 mg/day) may be more efficacious (318). Even at doses above 800 mg/day, there are virtually no extrapyramidal side effects, with the possible exception of akathisia.During the titration and early treatment phase, quetiapine-treated patients should be moni-tored for orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and sedation. Patients are typically man-aged with twice-daily dosing of quetiapine, since the elimination half-life is 6 hours (940).However, uneven dosing with the larger dose given at bedtime may improve tolerance of thesedation that is common early in treatment. In addition, patients should be monitored forweight gain, glucose abnormalities, and hyperlipidemias, which may occur during treatmentwith quetiapine. Table 1 outlines suggested strategies for the monitoring and clinical manage-ment of such adverse effects. Quetiapine is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochromeP450 CYP3A4 enzyme. Metabolism of the drug is minimally altered in patients with renal dis-ease, but it may be significantly altered in patients with liver disease. Smoking does not affectthe metabolism of quetiapine (500, 940). However, coadministration of phenytoin with que-tiapine has been demonstrated to increase the clearance of quetiapine up to fivefold (941). Sim-ilarly potent inducers of CYP3A4 are likely to produce similar decreases in quetiapine levels,which may lead to loss of therapeutic efficacy.
Ziprasidone
Ziprasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic with antagonist activity at dopamine (D
2),
serotonin (5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C, and 5-HT 1B/1D ), α1-adrenergic, and histamine (H 1) receptors.
In addition, ziprasidone has partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors and inhibits
neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (942).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 83Efficacy of ziprasidone
There are several published clinical trials comparing the efficacy of ziprasidone with placeboand with first-generation antipsychotics in the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder, and schizophreniform disorder. Placebo-controlled studies consistent-ly demonstrate that in acutely relapsed patients ziprasidone is efficacious in the treatment ofglobal psychopathology and the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as in increasingthe likelihood of clinical response (e.g., ≥20% improvement on rating scales of global psycho-
pathology) (943, 944). The evidence that negative symptoms improve with ziprasidone treat-ment is less clear, as significant improvement with ziprasidone, compared with placebo, is lessconsistently found across doses of drug and across studies (943–945). Active-comparator-con-trolled studies of ziprasidone compared with haloperidol demonstrate comparable improve-ment in positive and negative symptoms and in global psychopathology, as well as comparablelikelihood of clinical response (945, 946). It is likely that the improvements in negative symp-toms in these studies are due to a decreased likelihood of secondary negative symptoms (e.g.,related to parkinsonism or to psychosis) rather than to direct effects on primary negative symp-toms. However, in an additional placebo-controlled study of stable, residually symptomatic pa-tients, the time course of improvement in negative symptoms was consistent with a therapeuticeffect on primary negative symptoms (947). Nonetheless, this study was conducted with envi-ronmentally deprived persons who received more attention than usual by participating in thestudy, which may explain (in part) the observed improvements in negative symptoms.
One 52-week study demonstrated that ziprasidone is effective in reducing risk of relapse,
compared with placebo, during the maintenance phase of treatment (947). Relapse risk was43%, 35%, and 36% for patients receiving 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, and 160 mg/day of ziprasi-done, respectively, compared to 77% for placebo-treated patients.
Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intramuscular administration of ziprasi-
done for the treatment of acute agitation in relapsed patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder (76, 948, 949).
Shared side effects of ziprasidone
Ziprasidone is associated with a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects, a low risk of sedation,a low risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a moderate risk of cardiac conductionabnormalities, a low risk of anticholinergic effects, a low risk of weight gain and metabolic ab-normalities, and a low risk of prolactin elevation and sexual side effects. Neuroleptic malignantsyndrome occurs rarely with ziprasidone. Details on the nature and management of each ofthese side effects are provided in Section V.A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medi-cations.”
Other side effects of ziprasidone
While short-term clinical trials do not report insomnia as an adverse event with ziprasidone,there is some evidence from a longer-term outpatient study to suggest that stable outpatientswhose medication is switched to ziprasidone may experience insomnia (945). This insomniaappears early in treatment, is typically transient, and most often responds to usual sedative-hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem, trazodone).
Implementation of treatment with ziprasidone
Ziprasidone is an effective antipsychotic when administered in doses of 80–200 mg/day in theacute phase of schizophrenia. There is emerging evidence that doses up to 320 mg/day may besafe, although there are no published data suggesting improved efficacy at high doses. Stablepatients whose medication is switched to ziprasidone may report insomnia, which usually istransient and responsive to sedative-hypnotics.

84 APA Practice GuidelinesBefore treatment with ziprasidone is initiated in patients with preexisting cardiovascular dis-
ease and those who are at risk for electrolyte disturbances (e.g., patients taking diuretics and
those with chronic diarrhea), the safety of using the medication should be evaluated. This eval-uation should include laboratory assessment of electrolytes and an ECG. Preexisting prolongedQT syndrome, persistent findings of QTc interval >500 msec, history of arrhythmia, recentacute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure are contraindications to use ofziprasidone. The value of a screening ECG in apparently healthy persons to reliably detectcongenital prolonged QT syndrome is not established and is of questionable utility, given thenormal variability of the QT interval. During the maintenance phase of treatment, regularmonitoring of electrolytes should be done for patients who are also treated with diuretics orwho may be at risk for electrolyte disturbances. Patients should be monitored regularly forsymptoms of possible arrhythmia, including dizziness, syncopal episodes, and palpitations. Pa-tients with such symptoms should be referred for cardiovascular evaluation. Patients shouldalso be warned about concomitant treatment with other drugs that also may affect the QTinterval.
Patients are typically treated with twice-daily dosing of ziprasidone, since the elimination
half-life is 7 hours, and steady state is reached after 1–3 days. Food increases the absorption ofziprasidone; under fasting conditions only 60% of ziprasidone will be absorbed. T wo-thirds ofziprasidone is metabolized by aldehyde oxidase, and one-third by the cytochrome P450 system,primarily by the liver CYP3A4 enzyme, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 (950). Sex, age,smoking, and the presence of renal failure have not been found to affect the metabolism ofziprasidone, but liver disease potentially affects metabolism of the drug (951, 952). Ziprasi-done has little effect on other liver enzyme systems and has not been found to affect the me-tabolism of other drugs.
Aripiprazole
Aripiprazole is pharmacologically distinct from other second-generation antipsychotic medi-cations. It has partial agonist activity at dopamine (D
2) and serotonin (5-HT 1A) receptors and
antagonist activity at dopamine (D 3), serotonin (5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C, 5-HT 7), α1-adrenergic, and
histamine (H 1) receptors. In addition, aripiprazole inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin to a
modest extent (953, 954).
Efficacy of aripiprazole
There are several published clinical trials comparing the acute efficacy of aripiprazole with pla-cebo and first-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disor-der, and schizophreniform disorder. Placebo-controlled studies consistently demonstrate thatin acutely relapsed patients, aripiprazole is efficacious in the treatment of global psychopathol-ogy, in improving the likelihood of clinical response (e.g., ≥20% improvement on rating scales
of global psychopathology), and in improving the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (955).The evidence that negative symptoms improve with aripiprazole treatment is less clear, as sig-nificant improvement with aripiprazole, compared with placebo, is less consistently foundacross doses of drug and studies (955). It is possible that the improvements in negative symp-toms in these studies are due to decreased likelihood of secondary negative symptoms (e.g.,related to parkinsonism or to psychosis) rather than to direct effects on primary negative symp-toms. Active-comparator-controlled studies demonstrate comparable or occasionally greaterimprovement of global psychopathology and positive and negative symptoms, as well as an in-creased likelihood of clinical response, with aripiprazole, compared to haloperidol or chlor-promazine (955, 956).
T wo studies have found aripiprazole effective in reducing risk of relapse. In a 26-week
randomized, double-blind trial that included stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffec-tive disorder, the time to relapse was significantly longer for patients treated with aripiprazole

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 85(15 mg/day) than for those who received placebo, and a greater proportion of patients who re-
ceived placebo (57%) than of aripiprazole-treated patients (34%) met the relapse criteria (957).In a 52-week randomized, double-blind trial that included patients with acute exacerbation ofschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the response rate and time to discontinuation for anyreason were significantly greater for patients treated with aripiprazole (30 mg/day, N=647) thanfor those treated with haloperidol (10 mg/day, N=647) (unpublished 2003 manuscript of R.D.McQuade et al.). A greater proportion of aripiprazole-treated patients (43%) than of the halo-peridol-treated patients (30%) completed the 52-week trial.
Shared side effects of aripiprazole
Aripiprazole is associated with a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects, a moderate risk of se-dation, a low risk of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, a low risk of cardiac conductionabnormalities, a low risk of anticholinergic effects, a low risk of weight gain and metabolic ab-normalities, and a low risk of prolactin elevation and sexual side effects. There have been noreports to date of neuroleptic malignant syndrome with aripiprazole. Details on the nature andmanagement of each of these side effects are provided below in Section V .A.1.c, “Shared SideEffects of Antipsychotic Medications.”
Other side effects of aripiprazole
Aripiprazole received FDA approval for use in the treatment of schizophrenia in late 2002, andthus experience with the drug in clinical settings and knowledge of rare side effects are limited.Insomnia was not reported as an adverse event in treatment trials involving patients with acute-ly exacerbated symptoms (955, 956). Trials that included stable patients found transient in-somnia and acute agitation early in treatment, but these side effects typically resolved afterseveral weeks (955, 956). While there are no systematic studies, it is reasonable to treat aripip-razole-associated insomnia with sedative-hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem, trazodone, antihistamines)and agitation with benzodiazepines.
Implementation of treatment with aripiprazole
Aripiprazole is an effective antipsychotic when administered in doses of 10–30 mg/day in theacute phase of schizophrenia. With the possible exception of akathisia, parkinsonian symptomsrarely occur within the usual dose range.
Stable patients whose medication was switched to aripiprazole may report insomnia that
usually is transient and responsive to sedative-hypnotics.
Patients are typically treated with once-daily dosing of aripiprazole since the elimination
half-life is 75 hours (94 hours for the active metabolite dehydro-aripiprazole), and steady stateis reached after 14 days. Aripiprazole is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, primarilyby the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (958). Sex, age, smoking, and the presence of renalor hepatic failure have not been found to significantly affect the metabolism of aripiprazole(958). Aripiprazole has little effect on other liver enzyme systems and has not been found toaffect the metabolism of other drugs.
c) Shared side effects of antipsychotic medications
This section provides information on the side effects that are shared among multiple antipsy-chotic medications.
(1) Neurological side effects
Neurological side effects of antipsychotic medications include acute extrapyramidal side effectssuch as medication-induced parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia; chronic extrapyramidalside effects such as tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia; and neuroleptic malignant syn-drome.

86 APA Practice Guidelines(2) Extrapyramidal side effects
Extrapyramidal side effects are especially common in patients treated with the first-generationantipsychotics and occur to varying extents with several of the second-generation agents, es-pecially higher doses of risperidone. Of the spectrum of adverse effects of first-generation anti-psychotic medications, the neurological side effects are the most common and the mosttroublesome (959, 960). Extrapyramidal side effects can broadly be divided into acute andchronic categories. Acute extrapyramidal side effects are signs and symptoms that occur in thefirst days and weeks of antipsychotic medication administration, are dose dependent, and arereversible with medication dose reduction or discontinuation. The three types of acute extra-pyramidal side effects are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia (961–964). Chronic extrapy-ramidal side effects are signs and symptoms that occur after months and years of antipsychoticmedication administration, are not clearly dose dependent, and may persist after medicationdiscontinuation. Chronic extrapyramidal side effects include tardive dyskinesia and tardivedystonia. Detailed descriptions and differential diagnoses of the extrapyramidal side effect syn-dromes are provided in the “Medication-Induced Movement Disorders” section of DSM-IV-TR. More than 60% of patients who receive acute treatment with first-generation antipsychot-ic medications develop clinically significant extrapyramidal side effects in one form or another(959, 960, 965). Some patients may develop more than one form at the same time. Second-generation drugs as a group cause fewer or no extrapyramidal side effects, relative to first-generation drugs. Studies using multiple doses of risperidone (886, 887, 890) have shown thatrisperidone causes a dose-related increase in extrapyramidal side effects, with risk highest indoses greater than 6 mg/day (82, 899). In any individual patient, it is likely that the maximallyclinically effective dose of risperidone is lower than the dose that will cause extrapyramidal sideeffects. Thus, first-line intervention for extrapyramidal side effects due to risperidone shouldbe to gradually lower the dose until symptoms resolve. The other second-generation drugs causefew or no extrapyramidal side effects, with the possible exception of akathisia. However, young-er patients (children, adolescents, and young adults) may be more prone to extrapyramidal sideeffects from second-generation medications (unpublished 2003 manuscript of L. Sikich et al.).
Medication-induced parkinsonism is characterized by the symptoms of idiopathic Parkin-
son’s disease (rigidity, tremor, akinesia, and bradykinesia) and is the most common form of ex-trapyramidal side effect caused by first-generation antipsychotics (787, 964). These symptomsarise in the first days and weeks of antipsychotic medication administration and are dose depen-dent. Medication-induced parkinsonism generally resolves after discontinuation of antipsychot-ic medication, although some cases of persisting symptoms have been reported (966, 967).
Akinesia or bradykinesia is a feature of medication-induced parkinsonism that affects both
motor and cognitive function. A patient with this condition appears to be slow moving, lessresponsive to the environment, apathetic, emotionally constricted, and cognitively slowed.This effect has been noted alone or with other extrapyramidal side effects in almost one-half ofpatients treated with first-generation antipsychotics. In very severe cases, it may mimic catatonia.Akinesia is subjectively unpleasant and may be associated with poor medication adherence (968,969). Depressive symptoms can also be present in patients with akinesia, in which case the syn-drome is termed “akinetic depression” (970, 971). Symptoms of medication-induced parkin-sonism, in particular the cognitive and emotional features, need to be carefully distinguishedfrom the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that patients mayexperience these emotional and cognitive symptoms of parkinsonism in the absence of detect-able motor symptoms.
The first approach to treatment of parkinsonism associated with first-generation antipsy-
chotics should be to lower the antipsychotic dose to the EPS threshold (dose where minimalrigidity is detectable in a physical examination), since studies indicate that doses above the EPSthreshold are unlikely to yield further clinical benefits (94). If dose reduction does not suf-ficiently improve symptoms, then a switch to a second-generation antipsychotic should be

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 87considered. Medications with anticholinergic (e.g., benztropine) or dopamine agonist (e.g.,
amantadine) activity often reduce the severity of parkinsonian symptoms. However, dopamineagonists carry a potential risk of exacerbating psychosis, and anticholinergic drugs can causeanticholinergic side effects. Thus, excessive doses and chronic use of these agents should beavoided or minimized (972, 973).
Acute dystonia is characterized by the spastic contraction of discrete muscle groups. Dystonic
reactions occur in up to 10% of patients beginning therapy with high-potency first-generationantipsychotic agents. Although precise estimates of the incidence of dystonic reactions are notavailable, they appear to be less common with treatment with low-potency first-generationantipsychotic agents and relatively rare with second-generation antipsychotics. In addition tothe use of high-potency medications, other risk factors for dystonic reactions include youngage, male gender, high doses, and intramuscular administration. Dystonic reactions frequentlyarise after the first few doses of medication (90% occur within the first 3 days) (974). They canoccur in various body regions but most commonly affect the muscles of the neck, larynx, eyes,and torso (963). The specific name of the reaction is derived from the specific anatomic regionthat is affected. Hence, the terms “torticollis,” “laryngospasm,” “oculogyric crisis,” and “opis-thotonos” are used to describe dystonic reactions in specific body regions (975). These re-actions are sudden in onset, are dramatic in appearance, and can cause patients great distress.For some patients, these conditions, e.g., laryngospasm, can be dangerous and even life-threat-ening.
Acute dystonic reactions respond dramatically to the administration of anticholinergic or
antihistaminic medication. Parenteral administration will have a more rapid onset of actionthan oral administration. Short-term maintenance treatment with an oral regimen of anticho-linergic antiparkinsonian medication prevents the recurrence of acute dystonic reactions.
Akathisia is characterized by somatic restlessness that is manifest subjectively and objectively
in up to 30% of patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics (961, 970). Although pre-cise estimates of the incidence of akathisia are not available, it appears to be less common withlow-potency first-generation antipsychotics and even more infrequent with second-generationantipsychotic agents. Patients characteristically complain of an inner sensation of restlessnessand an irresistible urge to move various parts of their bodies. Objectively, this appears as in-creased motor activity. With mild akathisia, the patient may control body movements; in moresevere forms, the patient may rock from foot to foot while standing, pace, and have difficultysitting still. Even in mild forms in which the patient is able to control most movements, thisside effect is often extremely distressing to patients, is a frequent cause of nonadherence withantipsychotic treatment, and, if allowed to persist, can produce dysphoria. Case reports suggestthat akathisia may also be a possible contributor to aggressive or suicidal behavior (409). Inter-vention includes dose reduction or switching to a second-generation antipsychotic with lessrisk of akathisia. In this regard, however, it is important to note that risperidone may causeakathisia at the higher end of the dose range (887).
Effective treatments for akathisia include centrally acting beta-blockers such as a low dose
of propranolol (30–90 mg/day) (972, 976). When these medications are administered, bloodpressure and pulse rate should be monitored with dose changes. Benzodiazepines such aslorazepam and clonazepam are also effective in decreasing symptoms of akathisia (977). In con-trast, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medications have limited efficacy in treating akathisia(972). While there has been little systematic study, akathisia induced by risperidone or othersecond-generation antipsychotics is treated similarly to akathisia associated with first-genera-tion antipsychotic treatment.
A common problem that arises in assessing patients with akathisia is distinguishing this side
effect from psychomotor agitation associated with the psychosis. Mistaking akathisia for psy-chotic agitation and raising the dose of antipsychotic medication usually leads to a worseningof the akathisia and thus the agitation. When the etiology of agitation is unclear, the nonspe-

88 APA Practice Guidelinescific effects of benzodiazepines on akathisia and agitation can be useful, although the dose nec-
essary for therapeutic effects on psychotic agitation usually is higher than that required forakathisia (978).
Given the high rate of acute extrapyramidal side effects among patients receiving first-gen-
eration antipsychotic medications, and to a lesser extent risperidone, the prophylactic use ofantiparkinsonian medications may be considered. The benefit of this approach has been dem-onstrated in several studies. For example, Hanlon et al. (979) found that only 10% of patientstaking perphenazine with an antiparkinsonian medication developed an extrapyramidal side ef-fect, in contrast to 27% of patients taking perphenazine without an antiparkinsonian medica-tion. The risk is that some patients may be treated unnecessarily with these medications, riskinganticholinergic side effects (978). However, schizophrenia is a long-term illness, and the devel-opment of a therapeutic alliance is of paramount importance. The minimization of uncomfort-able, painful, and unnecessary side effects can contribute significantly to establishing such analliance. Thus, prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication may be considered for all patientswith a prior history of susceptibility to extrapyramidal side effects and for patients for whomantipsychotic agents known to induce these effects (e.g., first-generation agents, high doses ofrisperidone) are prescribed.
The various medications used to treat acute extrapyramidal side effects are listed in Table 5.
The major differences among the anticholinergic medications are in their potencies and dura-tions of action. Patients who are very sensitive to anticholinergic side effects (e.g., dry mouth,blurred vision, constipation) may require lower doses or less potent preparations (e.g., trihex-yphenidyl, procyclidine hydrochloride). The need for anticholinergic medications should bereevaluated after the acute phase of treatment is over and whenever the dose of antipsychoticmedication is changed. If the dose of antipsychotic medication is lowered, anticholinergic med-ication may no longer be necessary or may be given at a lower dose.
Tardive dyskinesia is a hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement disorder caused by
sustained exposure to antipsychotic medication; tardive dyskinesia can affect neuromuscularfunction in any body region but is most commonly seen in the oral-facial region (980, 981).(For a description of tardive dyskinesia and its differential diagnosis, see DSM-IV-TR.) Evalu-ation of the risk of tardive dyskinesia is complicated by the fact that spontaneous dyskinesiasare clinically indistinguishable from tardive dyskinesia and have been described in up to 20%of never-medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia, as well as in elderly patients (982,983). Thus dyskinetic movements are part of the natural history of schizophrenia. T ardive dys-kinesia occurs at a rate of approximately 4%–8% per year in adult patients treated with first-generation antipsychotics (980, 984). Various factors are associated with greater vulnerabilityto tardive dyskinesia, including older age, antipsychotic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, fe-male gender combined with postmenopausal status, diagnosis of affective disorder (particularlymajor depressive disorder), concurrent general medical disease such as diabetes, and use of highdoses of antipsychotic medications (982, 985–987). Studies comparing intermittent, targetedfirst-generation antipsychotic drug treatment with maintenance antipsychotic treatment havefound increased risk of tardive dyskinesia with targeted treatment strategies (988).
Tardive dyskinesia has been reported after exposure to any of the available antipsychotic
medications, although the risk appears to be substantially less (approximately 10-fold) with thesecond-generation antipsychotics, compared to first-generation antipsychotics (83, 319, 382,989–992). One study summarizing available longitudinal clinical trial data with risperidone re-ports an annual risk of 0.3%, which is substantially less than the expected risk with first-gener-ation antipsychotics of approximately 5% per year (989, 992, 993). In a 9-month study of olderpatients (mean age=66 years), substantially more patients treated with haloperidol (32%), com-pared with risperidone-treated patients (5%), developed tardive dyskinesia (535, 990). In thesestudies the mean dose of both antipsychotics was low, and the rates of tardive dyskinesia in thehaloperidol-treated subjects were similar to those reported for older patients in other studies

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 89(987). For olanzapine, analyses of longitudinal double-blind data from multiple studies find a
12-fold lower risk of tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine treatment, compared to haloperidoltreatment (0.05% and 7.45%, respectively) (319, 992). There are few systematic data concern-ing quetiapine and risk of tardive dyskinesia. In a 52-week open-label study of quetiapine thatincluded 184 patients age >65 years, there was no change in the severity of dyskinetic move-ments, as evaluated by rating scales (994). In addition, emerging results from studies of othersecond-generation antipsychotics suggest that low risk of tardive dyskinesia may be found withdrugs such as quetiapine that have a low risk of extrapyramidal effects.
With clozapine, although long-term prospective incidence studies are lacking, controlled
short- and long-term trials generally find that the severity of dyskinetic movements improves withclozapine treatment, compared to treatment with first-generation antipsychotics (769, 995).
Although the majority of patients who develop tardive dyskinesia have mild symptoms, a
proportion (approximately 10%) develop symptoms of moderate or severe degrees. An oftensevere variant of tardive dyskinesia is tardive dystonia, which is characterized by spastic musclecontractions in contrast to choreoathetoid movements (996). Tardive dystonia is often associ-ated with great distress and physical discomfort. Patients receiving antipsychotic medicationtreatment on a sustained basis (for more than 4 weeks) should be evaluated at a minimum of every3 months for signs of dyskinetic movements. The occurrence of dyskinetic movements warrantsa neurological evaluation (980).
T reatment options for tardive dyskinesia occurring in the context of treatment with first-
generation antipsychotic agents include switching to a second-generation antipsychotic or re-ducing the dose of the first-generation antipsychotic. An initial increase in dyskinetic symp-toms may occur after conversion to a second-generation drug or antipsychotic dose reduction(withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia). With sustained first-generation antipsychotic exposurewithout dose reduction after the development of tardive dyskinesia, the likelihood of reversibil-ity diminishes but is not lost. In some patients dyskinetic movements can persist despite longperiods of time without medication. Despite the fact that continued treatment with antipsy-chotic medication increases the chances for the persistence of tardive dyskinesia symptoms, inmany patients the severity of tardive dyskinesia does not increase over time at steady, moderatedoses. The documentation in the clinical record should reflect that, despite mild tardive dys-kinesia, a risk-benefit analysis favored continued maintenance of antipsychotic treatment toprevent the likelihood of relapse.
A large number of agents have been evaluated as possible treatment for tardive dyskinesia
with few positive results. Although not consistent, there is some evidence that vitamin E mayreduce the risk of development of tardive dyskinesia (225, 226). Given the low risk of side effectsassociated with vitamin E, patients may be advised to take 400–800 I.U. daily as prophylaxis.Small clinical trials have investigated the potential benefits of benzodiazepines, anticholinergicagents, calcium channel blockers (997), γ-aminobutyric acid agonists (998), essential fatty ac-
ids, estrogen, and insulin, with no studies yet producing convincing data to suggest any of theseagents may be effective treatments for tardive dyskinesia (225, 999–1002).
(3) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by the triad of rigidity, hyperthermia, and au-tonomic instability, including hypertension and tachycardia (962). In addition, neurolepticmalignant syndrome is often associated with an elevated level of serum creatine kinase. In pa-tients treated with second-generation antipsychotic medications, this classic triad of symptomsis generally although not invariably present (1003, 1004). The prevalence of neuroleptic ma-lignant syndrome is uncertain, but this effect probably occurs in less than 1% of patients treat-ed with first-generation antipsychotic medications (1005–1007) and is even more rare amongpatients treated with second-generation antipsychotic medications (1003, 1004, 1008–1012).

90 APA Practice GuidelinesNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed and can be fatal in 5%–20%
of patients if untreated (1013). It can be sudden and unpredictable in its onset and usually oc-
curs early in the course of treatment, often within the first week after treatment is begun or thedose is increased. Risk factors for neurolep tic malignant syndrome include acute agitation,
young age, male gender, preexisting neurological disability, physical illness, dehydration, rapidescalation of antipsychotic dose, use of high-potency medications, and use of intramuscularpreparations (1014, 1015). Other diagnostic considerations in patients presenting with rigidity,hyperthermia, autonomic instability, or elevated levels of serum creatine kinase include neuro-leptic-induced heat stroke, lethal catatonia, serotonin syndrome (in patients also taking sero-tonergic drugs such as SSRIs), anticholinergic syndrome, “benign” elevations in the level ofserum creatine kinase, and fever in association with clozapine treatment (855, 1015–1018).
Since neuroleptic malignant syndrome is rare, most evidence regarding treatment comes from
single case reports or case series. Antipsychotic medications should always be discontinued, andsupportive treatment to maintain hydration and to treat the fever and cardiovascular, renal, orother symptoms should be provided. Some case series suggest that, compared with supportivetreatment alone, treatment with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and amantadine orwith dantrolene, which directly reduces skeletal muscle rigidity, may improve the symptoms ofneuroleptic malignant syndrome (1019). Based on the overlap in symptoms between catatoniaand neuroleptic malignant syndrome (1020), treatment with benzodiazepines, such as loraz-epam, may also be helpful (1021, 1022). In patients with severe and treatment-resistant neuro-leptic malignant syndrome, ECT is reported to improve symptoms (107, 1016, 1023). Afterseveral weeks of recovery, patients may be retreated with antipsychotic medication cautiously(1024). Generally, when treatment is resumed, doses are increased gradually, and a medicationother than the precipitating agent is used (usually a second-generation antipsychotic or a first-generation antipsychotic medication of lower potency).
(4) Sedation
Sedation is a very common side effect of first-generation antipsychotic medications, as well asseveral of the second-generation agents, including clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and que-tiapine. This effect may be related to antagonist effects of those drugs on histamine, adrenergic,and dopamine receptors (777, 1025, 1026). Most patients experience some sedation, particu-larly with the low-potency first-generation agents such as chlorpromazine, but it occurs to someextent with virtually all antipsychotic medications. With clozapine, sedation is very common,and in many patients it may be persistent and severe. Quetiapine has a high risk of sedation thatmay be maximal at the low end of the dose range (e.g., maximal by 100–200 mg/day). Olan-zapine has a moderate dose-related risk of sedation. Risperidone produces dose-related sedation(890); within the usual dose range (<6 mg/day) the risk of sedation is relatively low, comparedto the risk with other first-generation and second-generation (e.g., olanzapine, clozapine, que-tiapine) antipsychotics.
Sedation is most pronounced in the initial phases of treatment, since most patients develop
some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. For agitated patients, thesedating effects of these medications in the initial phase of treatment can have therapeutic ben-efits. However, persistent sedation, including daytime drowsiness and increased sleep time, caninterfere with social, recreational, and vocational function. Lowering of the daily dose, consoli-dation of divided doses into one evening dose, or changing to a less sedating antipsychotic med-ication may be effective in reducing the severity of sedation.
There are no systematic data on specific pharmacological interventions for sedation, but caf-
feine is a relatively safe option (1027). Some forms of psychostimulants (e.g., modafinil) havealso been used to treat daytime drowsiness (1028). However, there have been case reports ofclozapine toxicity associated with modafinil and other stimulant treatments of sedation, andthus this drug combination should be carefully considered and used with caution (1029, 1030).

Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia
Hypotension is related to the antiadrenergic effects of antipsychotic medications. With cloza-pine treatment initiation and dose escalation, there is a high risk of orthostatic hypotension andcompensatory tachycardia, with rare (one of 3,000 patients treated) reports of cardiovascularcollapse (854). These side effects typically limit the rate of titration, and orthostatic vital signsshould be regularly monitored with dose escalation. When orthostatic hypotension is severe, itcan cause dizziness and syncopal episodes. Patients who experience severe postural hypotensionmust be cautioned against getting up quickly and without assistance. Elderly patients are par-ticularly prone to this adverse effect, and syncopal episodes may contribute to an increased riskof falls and related hip fractures in elderly patients. Risperidone has high affinity and quetiapinehas moderate affinity for α -adrenergic receptors and thus can produce orthostatic hypotension
and reflex tachycardia. Clozapine has the highest affinity and greatest propensity to cause hypo-tension. Gradual dose titration starting with a low dose minimizes risk. Management strategiesfor orthostatic hypotension include decreasing or dividing doses of antipsychotic or switchingto an antipsychotic without antiadrenergic effects. Supportive measures include the use ofsupport stockings, increased dietary salt, and, as a last resort, administration of the salt/fluid-retaining corticosteroid fludrocortisone to increase intravascular volume.
T achycardia can result from the anticholinergic effects of antipsychotic medications but may
also occur as a result of postural hypotension. While healthy patients may be able to toleratesome increase in resting pulse rate, this may not be the case for patients with preexisting heartdisease. Tachycardia unrelated to orthostatic blood pressure changes that result from anticholin-ergic effects may occur in up to 25% of patients treated with clozapine. Because of the cardio-vascular side effects of clozapine, extreme care should be taken in initiating a clozapine trial inpatients with heart disease. T achycardia due to anticholinergic effects without hypotension canbe managed with low doses of a peripherally acting beta-blocker (e.g., atenolol) (1031, 1032).
QTc prolongation
The length of time required for the heart ventricles to repolarize is measured by the QT intervalon the electrocardiogram. The QT interval varies with heart rate; thus, a QT interval correctedfor heart rate (the “QTc”) is routinely used clinically. Prolongation of the QTc interval above500 msec is associated with increased risk for a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, “torsades de pointes.”T orsades de pointes is associated with syncopal episodes and may lead to life-threatening con-sequences (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, sudden death).
Among the first-generation antipsychotic agents, thioridazine, mesoridazine, pimozide, and
high-dose intravenous haloperidol have been associated with risk of QTc prolongation (1033).Because of the clinically significant risk of torsades de pointes–type arrhythmias and the potentialfor related sudden death (1033), the FDA recommends that thioridazine should be used onlywhen patients have not had a clinically acceptable response to other available antipsychotics(885). This safety warning is available online at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2000/mellar.htm and at www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/thioridazine.htm.
Ziprasidone is associated with an average increase of 20 msec in the QTc interval; however,
the clinical effects of this magnitude of QT prolongation are uncertain (1034). Unlike drugsthat prolong the QTc interval to a greater extent (e.g., thioridazine) (1035), ziprasidone hasnot been reported to be associated with arrhythmias or sudden death (1034). Patients treatedwith ziprasidone should be monitored for other risk factors for torsades de pointes, includingcongenital prolonged QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, heart fail-ure, and factors that might increase levels of a drug associated with QTc prolongation (e.g.,hepatic or renal failure, overdose of ziprasidone or other drugs known to prolong the QTc

92 APA Practice Guidelinesinterval). Concomitant treatment with other drugs known to significantly prolong the QTc in-
terval at normal clinical doses should be avoided. A list of such drugs is available at http://www.torsades.org. Given the normal variability of the QT interval (about 100 msec), an ECGis of questionable value in screening for congenital prolonged QT syndrome or in evaluatingthe effects of ziprasidone on the QTc interval in individual patients. Glassman and Bigger(1036) have reviewed the literature on prolonged QTc interval, torsades de pointes, and sud-den death with antipsychotic drugs, including ziprasidone.
Anticholinergic and antiadrenergic effects
The anticholinergic effects of first-generation antipsychotic medications (along with the anti-cholinergic effects of antiparkinsonian medications, if concurrently administered) can producea variety of peripheral side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, tachycar-dia, urinary retention, and thermoregulatory effects. Anticholinergic side effects may occur in10%–50% of treated patients (980, 1037). These effects are also common with the second-generation agent clozapine. Although most anticholinergic side effects are mild and tolerable,these side effects can be particularly troublesome for older patients (e.g., older men with benignprostatic hypertrophy) (1037). In rare instances, serious consequences of anticholinergic effectscan occur. For example, death can result from ileus of the bowel if it is undetected. In addition,some patients can develop hyperthermia, particularly in warm weather.
Central anticholinergic effects include impaired learning and memory and slowed cogni-
tion. Symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include confusion, delirium, somnolence, and hal-lucinations (1038, 1039). Such symptoms are more likely to occur with medications that havemore potent anticholinergic effects (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine) or from administrationof anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medications and in elderly or medically debilitated pa-tients. Clozapine is frequently associated with anticholinergic side effects, including constipa-tion and urinary retention (1040, 1041). Rarely, these effects have been severe, resulting in fecalobstruction and paralytic ileus and enduring impairment of bladder function (1042). Becauseof these anticholinergic effects, patients with preexisting prostate hypertrophy require carefulmonitoring of urinary function, and clozapine is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angleglaucoma (1031, 1032). Olanzapine has moderate affinity for muscarinic receptors and acts asan antagonist at the M
1, M 2, M 3, and M 5 receptors; however, anticholinergic effects are infre-
quent. The rarity of these effects is believed to be due to a difference between the drug’s in vitrobinding affinities and its actions in vivo. Constipation is occasionally associated with olanza-pine treatment, but generally there is a low risk of anticholinergic side effects with olanzapine.Quetiapine has moderate affinity for muscarinic receptors. Constipation and dry mouth are oc-casionally associated with quetiapine treatment, and elderly and medically debilitated patientsmay be more sensitive to its anticholinergic side effects.
Anticholinergic side effects are often dose-related and thus may improve with lowering of
the dose or administration of the anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drug in divided doses. Incases of anticholinergic delirium, parenteral physostigmine (0.5–2.0 mg i.m. or i.v.) has beenused to reverse the symptoms, although this treatment should be provided only under closemedical monitoring.
(6) Weight gain and metabolic abnormalities
Weight gain occurs with most antipsychotic agents. Up to 40% of patients treated with first-generation agents gain weight, with the greatest risk associated with the low-potency antipsy-chotics (797). The most notable exception is molindone, which may not cause significantweight gain (1043). The risk of weight gain with clozapine is thought to be the highest of allantipsychotics (1043), with studies reporting that between 10% and 50% of clozapine-treatedpatients are obese (1044, 1045). Typically, weight gain is progressive over the first 6 months oftreatment, although some patients continue to gain weight indefinitely. In a meta-analysis of

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 93available studies, the mean weight gain after 10 weeks of treatment with clozapine was estimated
at 4.45 kg (1043). Weight gain also is common in patients treated with risperidone and olanzap-ine. With risperidone, mean weight gain is estimated at 2.1 kg over the first 10 weeks of treatment(1043) and 2.3 kg after 1 year (382). With olanzapine, mean weight gain is estimated at 4.2 kgafter 10 weeks of treatment (1043), and one study observed a mean weight gain of 12.2 kg after1 year of treatment with olanzapine (918). No appreciable weight gain was observed withziprasidone after 10 weeks (1043) or 1 year (947). Few studies have characterized the extent ofweight gain with quetiapine or aripiprazole.
While studies have not systematically examined the health consequences of antipsychotic-
related weight gain, the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancers, diabetes, osteo-arthritis, and sleep apnea is likely similar to that in idiopathic obesity. The association of highcholesterol and triglycerides with weight gain further increases the risk of cardiovascular disease(1046–1052). Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to these side effects (1053).
Prevention of weight gain should be a high priority, since weight loss is difficult for many
patients. Efforts should be made to intervene proactively, since obese persons rarely lose morethan 10% of body weight with weight loss regimens. When weight gain occurs, clinicians shouldsuggest or refer patients to diet and exercise interventions (1054). If the patient has not hadsubstantial clinical benefits of the antipsychotic medication that outweigh the health risks ofweight gain, a trial of an antipsychotic with lower weight-gain liability should be considered.Few systematic studies have been done to evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions toprevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain or to promote weight loss, although potential strat-egies include diet and exercise programs (1055, 1056). No pharmacological interventions haveproven efficacy in treating weight gain associated with second-generation antipsychotics, al-though uncontrolled studies have reported possible benefit from amantadine (1057, 1058),topiramate (1059–1063), the H
2 histamine antagonist nizatidine (1064, 1065), and noradrener-
gic reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (1066).
Uncontrolled studies and case series suggest that clozapine and olanzapine are associated
with increased risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes (1050–1052, 1067–1073). While controlledstudies are lacking, one prospective study found that 30 of 82 (36%) clozapine-treated outpa-tients developed diabetes during the 5-year follow-up period (1050). Complicating the evaluationof antipsychotic-related risk of diabetes is that schizophrenia is associated also with increased di-abetes risk (1074). In some patients obesity may contribute to diabetes risk. Other mechanismsmay also be involved. For example, insulin resistance may develop early in treatment with olan-zapine and contribute to abnormal regulation of glucose and subsequent diabetes (1075,1076).
Further, some of the second-generation antipsychotic agents, olanzapine and clozapine in
particular, have been associated with diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma,relatively rare complications of diabetes that are extremely dangerous if untreated (1077–1081). Numerous case reports have described scenarios in which diabetic ketoacidosis appearsacutely in the absence of a known diagnosis of diabetes (1082). Diabetic ketoacidosis can pre-sent with mental status changes that can be attributed to schizophrenia. The treating psychia-trist must be aware of the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis, given its potential lethality andits often confusing presentation. The overall prevalence and mechanism of diabetic keto-acidosis associated with antipsychotics and the differential risk of specific antipsychotic agentsto cause this side effect are at present unknown.
Given the rare occurrence of extreme hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or
death and the suggestion from epidemiological studies of an increased risk of treatment-emer-gent adverse events with second-generation antipsychotics, the FDA has requested all manu-facturers of second-generation antipsychotic medications to include a warning in their productlabeling regarding hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus.

94 APA Practice GuidelinesThere is also suggestive evidence that certain antipsychotic medications, particularly cloza-
pine and olanzapine, may increase the risk for hyperlipidemias. Most of the evidence is derived
from case reports and other uncontrolled studies (1048–1050, 1067, 1070, 1083–1087). Phar-macological treatment with lipid-lowering drugs should be considered in patients with hyper-lipidemia.
Table 1 lists suggested strategies for monitoring and clinical management associated with
weight gain, glucose abnormalities, and hyperlipidemias in patients with schizophrenia.
(7) Effects on sexual function
Disturbances in sexual function can occur with a number of antipsychotic agents, includingfirst- and second-generation agents (1088). Several mechanisms contribute to the genesis ofsexual side effects with these medications. Prolactin elevation is very common in patients treat-ed with first-generation antipsychotics as well as risperidone (1089). Female patients appear tobe more sensitive to prolactin elevation than male patients (1090). All first-generation antipsy-chotic medications increase prolactin secretion by blocking the inhibitory actions of dopamineon lactotrophic cells in the anterior pituitary. This prolactin elevation may be even greater withrisperidone than with first-generation antipsychotics. The reason for the propensity of risperi-done to elevate prolactin may be due to risperidone’s relative difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier, with the pituitary, which is outside the blood-brain barrier, exposed to higher pe-ripheral levels of risperidone (1091).
Effects of hyperprolactinemia may include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and lacta-
tion. Since prolactin also regulates gonadal function, hyperprolactinemia can lead to decreasedproduction of gonadal hormones, including estrogen and testosterone. In women decreasedgonadal hormone production may disrupt or even eliminate menstrual cycles. In both men andwomen prolactin-related disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can lead to de-creased sexual interest and impaired sexual function (1088).
The long-term clinical consequences of chronic elevation of prolactin are poorly under-
stood. There is some epidemiological evidence, however, that postmenopausal women mayhave an increased risk of breast cancer if exposed to medications that potentially elevate levelsof prolactin (1092). Chronic hypogonadal states may increase risk of osteopenia and osteo-porosis (1093–1097), but increased risk of these disorders has not been directly linked to anti-psychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia.
If a patient is experiencing clinical symptoms of prolactin elevation, the dose of antipsychot-
ic may be reduced or the medication regimen may be switched to an antipsychotic with lesseffect on prolactin (e.g., any of the second-generation antipsychotics with the exception of ris-peridone). When the antipsychotic must be maintained, dopamine agonists such as bromo-criptine (2–10 mg/day) or amantadine may reduce prolactin levels and thus the symptoms ofhyperprolactinemia (1058).
The association between the other second-generation antipsychotic medications (clozapine,
olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole) and sexual dysfunction is less clear. Sexualinterest and function may be reduced in both men and women receiving clozapine, but gener-ally to a lesser extent than with first-generation antipsychotics (1098, 1099). Sexual dysfunc-tion may also occur in patients treated with olanzapine and quetiapine (1100, 1101), but thereis no prospective study that might indicate whether a causal relationship exists.
Erectile dysfunction occurs in 23%–54% of men treated with first-generation medications
(812). Other effects can include ejaculatory disturbances in men and loss of libido or anorgas-mia in women and men. In addition, with specific antipsychotic medications, including thio-ridazine and risperidone, retrograde ejaculation has been reported, most likely because ofantiadrenergic and antiserotonergic effects (886). Dose reduction or discontinuation usuallyresults in improvement or elimination of symptoms. A 25–50-mg dose of imipramine at bed-time may be helpful for treating retrograde ejaculation induced by thioridazine (1102). If dose

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 95reduction or a switch to an alternative medication is not feasible, yohimbine (an α2-antagonist)
or cyproheptadine (a 5-HT 2 antagonist) can be used (797). Because retrograde ejaculation is
annoying rather than dangerous, psychoeducation may also help the patient tolerate this side
effect. Priapism is very rarely associated with clozapine (1103, 1104), risperidone (1104),olanzapine (1105, 1106), quetiapine (1107), and ziprasidone (1108, 1109). There have beenno reports to date of priapism associated with aripiprazole.
2. Adjunctive medications
A wide variety of medications, including additional antipsychotics, have been added to anti-psychotic medications, either to enhance their efficacy for the treatment of symptoms of schizo-phrenia or to treat other symptoms often associated with the illness. Targets of these addedmedications have included residual positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, de-pression, agitation and aggression, obsessions and compulsions, and anxiety. Some medications(e.g., antidepressants) have been used for more than one symptom cluster (e.g., depression, ob-sessions and compulsions).
a) Anticonvulsants
A number of studies of the efficacy of carbamazepine and valproate in schizophrenia have beendone. Excluding findings suggesting their use in treating patients whose illness has strongaffective components, the evidence is quite convincing that neither agent, used alone, is ofsignificant value in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. Recent studies have tended toconcentrate on use of anticonvulsants in combination with antipsychotics.
With carbamazepine, studies examining the effects of the drug in combination with first-
generation antipsychotics have had negative findings (236, 1110). For valproate, on the otherhand, both negative and positive results have been noted (102, 235–237, 1111). Most studieshave included relatively few patients, but the study by Casey et al. (237) included 242 subjectswith acutely exacerbated symptoms who were randomly assigned to receive risperidone or olan-zapine, each combined with placebo or divalproex. Compared with the placebo group, the di-valproex group improved significantly more rapidly over the first 2 weeks of treatment. Bothgroups were equally improved by the end of the study at 4 weeks. This intriguing result war-rants further study and replication to establish whether divalproex augmentation shortens thetime to discharge and to determine the value of longer-term divalproex augmentation.
(1) Side effects
There are generally no additional side effects from the combination of anticonvulsant and anti-psychotic medications beyond those of the individual medications themselves. Carbamazepineis not recommended for use with clozapine, because of the potential of both medications tocause agranulocytosis.
(2) Implementation
For patients with schizophrenia, these medications are generally used in the same therapeuticdose ranges and blood levels that are used for the treatment of seizure disorders and bipolar dis-order. Studies to determine dosing in schizophrenia have not been reported. A complicatingfactor is the fact that carbamazepine can decrease the blood levels of antipsychotic medicationsby induction of hepatic enzymes (1112–1114).
b) Antidepressants
Studies of antidepressants in schizophrenia broadly subdivide into those that have examinedthese agents as treatment for depression and those that have tested their efficacy for other symp-toms, such as negative symptoms. These areas will be reviewed separately.

96 APA Practice GuidelinesGood clinical practice dictates that clinicians be alert to the occurrence of depression in a
broad spectrum of psychiatric and medical disorders and treat it when it is diagnosed. Earlier
work (1115) indicated the effectiveness of a tricyclic antidepressant for symptoms of depressionin schizophrenia, and 12-month follow-up showed the advantage of maintenance treatment(1116). One study found the effects of an SSRI (sertraline) to be equal to those of imipraminefor treatment of postpsychotic depression (1117) and another noted positive effects of citalo-pram (540), but the only placebo-controlled study of an SSRI for treatment of depressed pa-tients with schizophrenia showed a large placebo effect and no difference between groups(1118). Although the evidence is most strong for patients who meet the syndromal criteria fordepression, two reviews have noted the paucity of evidence for the efficacy of antidepressantsin schizophrenia (222, 1119). For clinicians, a further question, not addressed in the literature,is whether failure of an antidepressant to improve depression in a person with schizophrenia isan indication for changing antidepressants or changing antipsychotics.
A number of studies have tested the efficacy of antidepressants in treating the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia. The overlap between depressive and negative symptoms has com-plicated study design and interpretation. In five placebo-controlled studies of SSRIs for nega-tive symptoms, one reported a modest advantage of fluoxetine added to long-acting injectableantipsychotic medication (1120), while four found no advantage for SSRIs, compared withplacebo, in patients receiving clozapine (1121) or first-generation antipsychotics (1122–1124).Several studies of adjunctive fluvoxamine have demonstrated positive results (1125–1127). Anopen-label study of selegiline found beneficial effects on negative symptoms (1128), but in aplacebo-controlled trial both the selegiline and placebo groups improved, and there was no dif-ference between them (1129). Overall, the evidence for efficacy of antidepressants for negativesymptoms of schizophrenia is very modest. Since most of the studies have been done in com-bination with first-generation antipsychotics, it is possible that the findings might be differentwith second-generation antipsychotics, although this possibility seems unlikely.
In terms of treating other symptoms that are sometimes observed in patients with schizo-
phrenia, two small studies found efficacy of clomipramine and fluvoxamine in treating obses-sive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia (221, 223). In a small crossover study in whichcitalopram or placebo was added to first-generation antipsychotics, patients with a history ofaggression had significantly fewer incidents while taking citalopram (1130).
(1) Side effects
Although the side effects of antidepressants are no different when administered to patients withschizophrenia than to patients with other disorders, combinations of antipsychotics and anti-depressants have the potential for adverse, even dangerous, pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-namic interactions. In addition to prior history of response to antidepressant treatment, potentialdrug-drug interactions should be taken into account in selecting an antidepressant agent. Ofparticular concern with regard to drug toxicity are the inhibitory effects of some antidepres-sants on clozapine metabolism, leading to increased serum levels and risk of seizures. Fluvoxa-mine can cause large increases in clozapine serum levels, and the combination of the two drugsshould be avoided. Some other SSRIs and nefazodone may also cause clinically significant in-creases in clozapine serum levels and should be used carefully in clozapine-treated patients.Clozapine serum levels should be monitored after adding one of the antidepressants discussedearlier to the medication regimen of patients treated with clozapine. Because bupropion itselfis associated with a risk of seizures, a phar macodynamic interaction with clozapine exists.
Therefore, the combination of clozapine and bupropion should be avoided. There are manysources of information about drug-drug interactions. A useful, frequently updated web sitemaintained by D. Flockhart at Indiana University is available at http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart. Another useful drug interaction computer program maintained by J. Oesterheld andD. Osser is available at http://www.mhc.com/Cytochromes.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 97(2) Implementation
Use of antidepressants in schizophrenia generally has been studied by using the doses and titra-tion schedules that are usually used when the agents are administered by themselves. There is noreason to think that dosing should be modified on the basis of coexisting schizophrenia. As not-ed earlier, however, the potential for drug-drug interactions suggests that close monitoring ofside effects is warranted. Monitoring of the blood levels of the antipsychotic at baseline and afterseveral weeks of antidepressant treatment may be helpful, particularly for clozapine, where thereis evidence that high blood levels are associated with increased risk of seizures and low levels maybe ineffective. The same considerations apply when an antidepressant is being discontinued.
c) Antipsychotics
Most reports on the combination of antipsychotics describe the effects of combinations withclozapine. The only randomized, controlled trial used sulpiride, a dopamine receptor antago-nist similar to first-generation antipsychotics that is available in Europe but not in NorthAmerica. Shiloh et al. (1131) added placebo or sulpiride, titrated up to a dose of 600 mg/day,to clozapine for 10 weeks in the treatment of 28 partially responsive patients who were takingstable doses of clozapine and who had BPRS scores >42. The sulpiride group had significantlygreater decreases in BPRS (15%), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (10%), andScale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (12%) scores.
Case series show improvements in residual positive symptoms with the addition of a num-
ber of other antipsychotics to clozapine. These agents include loxapine (233), pimozide (234),and risperidone (232).
Although the quality of the evidence for augmentation of clozapine with another antipsy-
chotic is modest, this strategy seems reasonable in treating patients whose response to clozapineis fair at best. Before taking this step, however, the clinician should be sure that the clozapinetreatment has been of sufficient duration and that the patient’s blood level of clozapine indi-cates a sufficient dose. The other alternatives—switching to monotherapy with a different anti-psychotic not already tried or combining two other antipsychotics—have even less evidence tosupport them than does augmentation of clozapine.
Combinations of two or more antipsychotics, neither of which is clozapine, are also used fre-
quently for treatment of schizophrenia (1132). Some of this use reflects periods of cross-titrationin the transition from one antipsychotic to another, but much of it represents long-term treat-ment. Evidence for (or against) this practice is minimal, as there are no controlled studies in theliterature. The largest case series includes six persons with inadequate responses to 20–40 mg/day of olanzapine, who had average decreases in BPRS and PANSS scores of 35% after additionof 60–600 mg/day of sulpiride for at least 10 weeks (1133). Without a control group, such re-sults are difficult to evaluate. Moreover, sulpiride is not available in the United States, and thereis no way to know if similar results might be found with other antipsychotics.
The absence of evidence for combinations of antipsychotics does not mean that there are no
patients who are best treated with such a combination. However, their use should be justifiedby strong documentation that the patient is not equally benefited by monotherapy with eithercomponent of the combination. Practitioners should be aware of the problems inherent incombination therapies, including increased side effects and drug interactions as well as in-creased costs and decreased adherence (1132).
d) Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines have been evaluated as monotherapy for schizophrenia and as adjuncts to an-tipsychotic medications. Wolkowitz and Pickar (224) reviewed double-blind studies of benzo-diazepines as monotherapy and found that positive effects (reductions in anxiety, agitation,global impairment, or psychotic symptoms) were reported in nine of 14 studies. Six of 10 stud-ies that specifically examined psychotic symptoms showed greater efficacy for benzodiazepines

98 APA Practice Guidelinesthan placebo. In a study comparing diazepam, fluphenazine, and placebo as treatments for im-
pending psychotic relapse in patients who were taking no antipsychotic medications, the effectsof diazepam and fluphenazine were equal, and both were superior to placebo (1134).
Double-blind studies evaluating benzodiazepines as adjuncts to antipsychotic medications
were also reviewed by Wolkowitz and Pickar (224). Seven of 16 studies showed some positiveeffect on anxiety, agitation, psychosis, or global impairment; five of 13 showed efficacy in treat-ing psychotic symptoms specifically. The reviewers concluded that benzodiazepines may im-prove the response to antipsychotic medications.
Some studies indicate that the effectiveness of benzodiazepines as adjuncts to antipsychotic
medications is limited to the acute phase and may not be sustained. Altamura et al. (1135)found that clonazepam plus haloperidol, but not haloperidol alone or placebo, produced sig-nificant lowering of total BPRS scores after 1 week. This reduction, which was primarily dueto decreases in anxiety and tension, disappeared by the end of the 4-week study. Csernansky etal. (1136) also found that when alprazolam was added to antipsychotic medication, there wasa significant reduction in the BPRS withdrawal/retardation subfactor score after the first week,but this reduction disappeared by study end at week 5.
Benzodiazepines are commonly used alone or in combination with an antipsychotic for
acutely agitated patients in emergency department settings. One study compared the effects oflorazepam with those of haloperidol over the first 4 hours of treatment (1137). The com-pounds were equal in efficacy, and the authors suggested that lorazepam may be preferable, inthat delayed extrapyramidal symptoms can occur with haloperidol. Another study comparedlorazepam and haloperidol alone with the combination of both over 12 hours (75). Combina-tion treatment was modestly more effective during the first 3 hours, and there were no signif-icant differences between groups at later times. The haloperidol alone group needed moreinjections and had more extrapyramidal symptoms.
Benzodiazepines are effective for treatment of acute catatonic reactions, whether associated
with schizophrenia or other disorders (137, 140, 142, 1138–1141). Although most studieshave used lorazepam (1–2 mg i.v. or i.m. or 2–4 mg p.o., repeated as needed over 48–72 hours),beneficial effects have also been found with clonazepam and oxazepam. One report has ques-tioned the value of benzodiazepines in treating chronic catatonia, although patients were main-tained on antipsychotic treatment during the study, and the contribution of tardive dystoniato the observed behaviors was uncertain (1142).
(1) Side effects
Benzodiazepines have some limitations in schizophrenia. Their common side effects include se-dation, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and a tendency to cause behavioral disinhibition in somepatients. This last side effect can be a serious problem in patients who are being treated for agi-tation. Reactions to withdrawal from benzodiazepines can include psychosis and seizures. In ad-dition, patients with schizophrenia are vulnerable to both abuse of and addiction to these agents.
(2) Implementation
Evidence relating to the choice of a specific benzodiazepine is limited, since few studies havecompared the effectiveness of more than one. Important considerations in selection includeabuse potential and severity of withdrawal symptoms if treatment is prolonged. In general,longer-acting agents have lower abuse potential. Withdrawal of alprazolam seems more likelyto be associated with seizures, compared to withdrawal of other benzodiazepines.
e) Beta-blockers
Beta-blocking agents are often used for treatment of drug-induced akathisia, discussed in Sec-tion V .A.1.c, “Shared Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medications.” There are also a few con-trolled studies of the combination of beta-blockers with antipsychotics to treat aggression.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 99Pindolol in a dose of 5 mg t.i.d. reduced aggression scores significantly more than placebo in a
double-blind crossover study that included 30 male patients with schizophrenia in a maxi-mum-security facility (100). In a psychiatric intensive care setting, 80–120 mg/day of nadololhad initial beneficial effects on psychosis scores and extrapyramidal symptoms, compared withplacebo (101). The difference in extrapyramidal symptoms persisted over the 3 weeks of thestudy. In both of these studies, most patients were taking first-generation agents. Replicationof the findings with aggressive patients taking second-generation agents would be helpful. Asnoted earlier, clozapine is indicated as a treatment for persistently aggressive, psychotic patients.
f) Cognition enhancers
Cognitive deficits are characteristic of schizophrenia, and several studies have examined the ef-ficacy of adding acetylcholinesterase inhibitors developed for use in dementia to treat patientswith schizophrenia. One case report found substantial cognitive benefits from donepezil, com-pared with placebo (247), and an uncontrolled study observed positive results with donepezilon a variety of cognitive measures (249). However, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial ofdonepezil in 34 patients with chronic schizophrenia reported no group differences (248). Assuch, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the usefulness of these agents in im-proving cognitive performance in schizophrenia.
g) Glutamatergic agents
Because phencyclidine, which blocks ion channels associated with NMDA-type glutamate re-ceptors, can produce a clinical state with psychotic and negative symptoms resembling schizo-phrenia, agents with glutamatergic properties have been tested in schizophrenia (1143). Theagents that have been tested are glycine, 
D-cycloserine, and D-serine. Of these, only D-cycloserine
is available for medicinal human use in the United States, as an antituberculosis treatment.
Five randomized, controlled trials have examined the effects of glycine in doses ranging
from 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg. Most have reported beneficial effects of glycine on negative symptoms,with decreases of 15%–40% in negative symptom measures (239, 240, 242, 1144). Little effecton positive symptoms has been found in most studies. In a group of 30 patients who were tak-ing clozapine, glycine did not produce any significant symptom changes, compared with pla-cebo (241), confirming the result of an earlier case series report (1145). Javitt et al. (242) did,however, report robust negative symptom improvements in four patients who received cloza-pine plus glycine.
Results with 
D-cycloserine are more variable. The usual dose is 50 mg/day. Modest, but sig-
nificant, decreases in negative symptoms were found by some investigators (244–246) but notothers (1146, 1147). In a study of 
D-cycloserine added to clozapine, there was no benefit of the
combination (243), which may be related to its dose-response curve.
A report by T sai et al. (238) on adjunctive D-serine noted significant decreases in positive
and negative symptoms in patients stabilized with a first-generation antipsychotic or risperi-done. The same group later reported no benefit from adding 
D-serine to clozapine (1148).
Overall, the evidence for glutamatergic agents is encouraging, except as additions to clozapine.
Most studies have used first-generation antipsychotics, risperidone, or clozapine. It remains tobe seen if combinations of glutamatergic agents with other second-generation antipsychoticsare helpful. Although the data seem most positive for glycine, studies directly comparing theseagents are needed to determine if their effects actually differ.
h) Lithium
Lithium as a sole treatment has limited effectiveness in schizophrenia and is inferior to treat-ment with antipsychotic medications (1149–1152).
Earlier reports indicated that when added to antipsychotic medications, lithium augmented
the antipsychotic response, in general, and improved negative symptoms specifically (1153,

100 APA Practice Guidelines1154). Other evidence indicated benefits of lithium for patients with schizophrenia with affec-
tive symptoms and for patients with schizoaffective disorder (1155–1159).
More recent literature, however, has not reported robust effects (1160). Relatively low doses
of lithium over an 8-week period improved anxiety symptoms more than did placebo, but ef-fects in other areas of psychopathology were not found (1161). Patients who had not respondedto 6 months of treatment with fluphenazine decanoate showed no more improvement than theplacebo group after 8 weeks of lithium augmentation at therapeutic levels (1162). There havebeen no reported controlled trials of lithium combined with second-generation antipsychotics.Since at least some of these agents have evidence for effects on depression, anxiety, and moodstabilization, the potential value of combining lithium with them may be limited.
(1) Side effects
The side effects of lithium include tremor, gastrointestinal distress, sedation or lethargy, im-paired coordination, weight gain, cognitive problems, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with as-sociated polyuria and polydipsia, renal insufficiency, hair loss, benign leukocytosis, acne, andedema. These have been reviewed in detail in APA’s  Practice Guideline for the Treatment of
Patients With Bipolar Disorder  (1163). The combination of an antipsychotic medication and
lithium may increase the possibility of the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.However, the evidence for this association comes mainly from some debated reports of cases orseries of cases, rather than from quantitative data. Most reported cases of neuroleptic malignantsyndrome in patients treated with lithium plus antipsychotic medication have occurred in casesof high lithium blood levels associated with dehydration.
(2) Implementation
Generally, lithium is added to the antipsychotic medication that the patient is already receiving,after the patient has had an adequate trial of the antipsychotic medication but has reached aplateau in the level of response and has persisting residual symptoms. The dose of lithium isthat required to obtain a blood level in the range of 0.8–1.2 meq/liter. Response to treatmentusually appears promptly; a trial of 3–4 weeks is adequate for determining whether there is atherapeutic response, although some investigators have noted that improvements may emergeonly after 12 weeks or more (1160). Patients should be monitored for adverse effects that arecommonly associated with lithium (e.g., polyuria, tremor) and with its interaction with an an-tipsychotic medication (e.g., extrapyramidal side effects, confusion, disorientation, other signsof neuroleptic malignant syndrome) (266), particularly during the initial period of combinedtreatment. Given the toxicity of lithium in overdose, prescription of conservative quantitiesshould be considered for patients at increased risk for suicidal behaviors.
i) Monoaminergic agents
Some studies have examined the efficacy of adjunctive dopaminergic and noradrenergic agentsin schizophrenia. High doses of oral tyrosine added to molindone produced no clinical effectsdifferent from placebo in a crossover study of 11 patients, even though there was physiologicalevidence that the tyrosine had CNS effects (1164). Clonidine added to 20 mg/day of haloperidolreduced psychotic symptoms more than placebo in a small study of 12 patients (1165). The lackof an effect of clonidine on chronic polydipsia in schizophrenia has recently been reported (459).
j) Polyunsaturated fatty acids
Based on hypotheses concerning membrane stability and second messenger dysfunction inschizophrenia, several investigators have tested the efficacy of polyunsaturated fatty acids in theillness. The bulk of the evidence comes from studies of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). One studyalso examined docosahexaenoic acid and found it had no effects (1166).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 101In separate studies, Peet et al. (1166) found that EPA added to a stable dose of antipsychotic
improved total and positive symptoms more than placebo and that EPA alone was more effec-
tive as sole treatment for unmedicated schizophrenia patients than placebo alone. By contrast,Fenton et al. (1167) found no benefit of EPA, compared with placebo, in a study of more than80 patients. Emsley et al. (1168), in a South African cohort, noted greater decreases in PANSSand dyskinesia scores with EPA added to stable antipsychotic dose. The two phenomena werecorrelated; those with dyskinesia improvements were most likely to also have symptom im-provements. Patients taking clozapine did not benefit from EPA treatment.
The EPA data are intriguing but far from definitive. Most data come from studies of com-
bination therapy with first-generation antipsychotics. The compound appears to be free of sideeffects other than initial mild gastrointestinal upset in some patients.
/L50776 B. OTHER SOMATIC THERAPIES
1. ECT
a) EfficacyThe efficacy of acute treatment with ECT in patients with schizophrenia has been described inmultiple case series and uncontrolled studies as well as a number of controlled trials; detailedreviews have been provided by Fink and Sackeim (106), an APA task force (107), and Tharyanand Adams (108). Although early research used small patient samples that were not well char-acterized and probably included some patients with mood disorder, antipsychotic treatmentalone generally produced better short-term outcomes than ECT alone. There also appeared tobe no advantage to ECT , compared to sham treatment. On the other hand, combined treat-ment with ECT and first-generation antipsychotic medications was more effective than eithertreatment by itself in most (109–118) but not all (1169, 1170) studies. In patients with treat-ment-resistant illness, case series also suggest that ECT may augment response to first-genera-tion antipsychotics (119–125, 229). More recent reports suggest that increased therapeuticbenefit may be seen with combined use of ECT and second-generation antipsychotic medica-tions (127–135). Thus, ECT in combination with antipsychotic medications may be consid-ered for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have severe psychoticsymptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotic agents.
In terms of factors that may predict a greater likelihood of response to ECT , little rigorous
evidence exists. While many psychiatrists believe that mood symptoms or a diagnosis ofschizoaffective disorder suggest a better response to ECT , the evidence supporting this view isinconsistent (1171–1176). However, some reports suggest that greater benefits are observed inpatients with positive symptoms (1177), shorter illness and episode durations (125, 1178–1180), or fewer paranoid or schizoid premorbid personality traits (1173).
Patients with catatonic features constitute another group who have been clinically felt to de-
rive particular benefit from treatment with ECT . Evidence in the more recent literature is lim-ited by the inclusion of patients with mood disorder diagnoses and consists primarily of caseseries (139, 141, 142) and open prospective trials (136–138, 140, 143, 1141). Nonetheless,findings from these studies confirm the clinical impression that ECT is beneficial in patientswith schizophrenia who have prominent catatonic features that have not responded to a trialof lorazepam.
The efficacy of ECT as a continuation/maintenance therapy has been evaluated in only one
randomized, single-blind clinical trial, which assessed patients with treatment-resistant schizo-phrenia (229). Patients who had responded to an acute course of treatment with concomitantbilateral ECT and the first-generation antipsychotic flupenthixol (N=45) were randomly as-

102 APA Practice Guidelinessigned to receive continuation therapy with ECT alone, flupenthixol alone, or combination
treatment. Relapse rates at 6 months in those receiving combined treatment were less than halfthose in the other treatment groups (40% versus 93%). These findings supplement clinical ob-servations of the benefits of maintenance ECT for some patients (227, 228) and support theuse of ECT for those responding to an acute course of ECT in whom pharmacological prophy-laxis alone has been ineffective or cannot be tolerated.
b) Side effects
Effects of ECT on the cardiovascular system are seen in virtually all patients but are typically be-nign and self-limited. With administration of the ECT stimulus, parasympathetic activation pro-duces an initial bradycardia, and, in some instances, a brief sinus pause may be noted. Thesubsequent sympathetic activation that occurs with induction of a generalized seizure producesa transient rise in heart rate and blood pressure and resulting increases in cardiac workload, in-tracranial pressure, and blood-brain barrier permeability (107, 1181). Typically, these effects nor-malize spontaneously; however, when they are prolonged or occur in patients with preexistingcardiac or vascular disease, medications may be needed to minimize these physiological responses(1182, 1183). Less commonly, ECT may be associated with more serious cardiac arrhythmias,ischemia, and infarction, although the type, severity, and likelihood of cardiac complications aregenerally related to the type and severity of preexisting cardiac disease (1184, 1185).
Cognitive side effects may also be observed with ECT , although there is much individual
variation in the extent and severity of such effects (107). In addition, the cognitive effects ofECT in persons with schizophrenia are unclear, since most studies of cognition after ECT haveinvolved patients treated for depression. For many patients, however, the ECT treatment andits associated anesthesia are associated with a transient postictal confusional state, at times ac-companied by postictal agitation (1186). Patients may also experience some difficulties withrapid forgetting of newly learned information and in recalling information, particularly forevents occurring near the time of the treatment (1187–1189). This retrograde memory impair-ment typically resolves in a few weeks to months after cessation of treatment (1190, 1191), but,rarely, patients report more pervasive or persistent cognitive disruption that involves more dis-tant memories (1192). On the other hand, for many patients, improvements in concentrationand attention with ECT are associated with improvement rather than worsening of objectivememory function (1193, 1194).
Other side effects that are commonly noted after ECT include headache, generalized muscle
aches, and nausea and/or vomiting. These effects usually resolve spontaneously or with analge-sic or antiemetic medications.
c) Implementation
Before initiating a course of ECT, a pre-ECT evaluation is conducted to determine the poten-tial benefits of ECT for the patient, the potential risks of ECT based on the patient’s medicaland psychiatric status, and the potential modifications that could be made in medications orin the ECT or anesthetic technique to minimize those risks (107). Although there are no ab-solute contraindications to ECT, recent myocardial infarction, some cardiac arrhythmias, andsome intracranial-space-occupying lesions may increase risk and are indications for caution andconsultation. Morbidity and mortality with ECT are also increased in the presence of severepreexisting pulmonary disease and with higher levels of anesthetic risk (i.e., status 4 or 5 in theAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification [http://www.asahq.org/clinical/physicalstatus.htm]).
During the informed consent process, these and other potential risks of ECT will be con-
sidered along with the potential benefits of ECT and the corresponding risks and benefits ofother therapeutic approaches. The informed consent process will also include a discussion ofthe ECT procedure, including a description of the anesthesia used for the treatment, the elec-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 103trode placement being used to administer the treatment, and the likely number of ECT ses-
sions that will be required.
In terms of electrode placement, no recent studies have assessed the effects of differing elec-
trode placements in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who receive ECT .The two studies that did compare bitemporal to unilateral nondominant hemisphere electrodeplacements in patients with schizophrenia used a sine wave stimulus, did not measure the ex-tent to which stimulus intensities were suprathreshold, and had high rates of patient dropout,making their findings of limited utility to present ECT practice (1195, 1196). Although find-ings in patients with depression suggest that unilateral (1187–1189) and perhaps bifrontal(1197, 1198) electrode placement may be associated with fewer cognitive effects and that effi-cacy with unilateral electrode placement may depend on the extent to which the stimulus in-tensity exceeds the seizure threshold, the applicability of these observations to patients withschizophrenia is uncertain. A single randomized, double-blind study assessed three differentstimulus intensities in 66 patients treated with bitemporal ECT and found that rates of remissionand effects on cognition were comparable (1199). However, among patients who remitted, thosereceiving stimulus intensities just above the seizure threshold required more treatments and hada longer time to remission than patients treated with stimulus intensities that were two to fourtimes the seizure threshold. Thus, in making decisions about stimulus intensity and electrodeplacement for ECT, psychiatrists may wish to consider factors such as past responses to treat-ment including ECT , existing cognitive impairment, the need for a more rapid response totreatment, and medical problems or concomitant medications that may increase the seizurethreshold and/or may increase the risk associated with each ECT treatment. In addition, indi-vidualization of the stimulus intensity to the patient by using either stimulus titration or a for-mula-based dosing strategy is advisable.
The likely number of ECT treatments required should also be reviewed with the patient.
Again evidence is limited, although clinical case series primarily from the older literature sug-gest that achieving full clinical benefit for patients with schizophrenia may require a longercourse of acute treatment than for patients with mood disorders (229, 1179, 1200). In general,ECT is given two to three times per week, although some practitioners will taper the frequencyof treatments near the end of the treatment course (1201). Additional details on ECTadministration can be found in the 2001 APA ECT Task Force Report (107).
2. rTMS
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has recently been studied as another so-matic technique for ameliorating psychotic symptoms. Whereas the electrical stimulation as-sociated with ECT produces a generalized seizure and global central nervous system excitation,rTMS permits targeted stimulation of specific brain regions that may be involved in the genesisof psychosis (144, 145). These unique features suggest that rTMS may be able to produce ther-apeutic effects without some of the associated side effects and the need for anesthesia with ECT .Data from one small (N=24) randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial (146) and twosmall (N=8 and N=12) randomized, double-blind, crossover trials (147, 148) suggest that im-provements in auditory hallucinations occur when rTMS of the left temporal-parietal cortex isused to augment antipsychotic treatment. However, data from another small (N=25) random-ized, controlled trial (1202), which stimulated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, showedno such effect of rTMS on psychotic symptoms. In these studies, the effect of rTMS on moreglobal measures of psychopathology was also variable, although no significant changes werenoted in mood, anxiety, or cognition. Although these findings of potential benefits of rTMSin schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are interesting and worthy of future research,rTMS has not been approved for use in patients with schizophrenia, and there is insufficientevidence to recommend its use in clinical practice.

104 APA Practice Guidelines/L50776 C. SPECIFIC PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS
As part of a comprehensive treatment approach, psychosocial interventions can improve the
course of schizophrenia when integrated with psychopharmacological treatments (1203,1204). These interventions can provide additional benefits for patients in such areas as relapseprevention, improved coping skills, better social and vocational functioning, and ability tofunction more independently. While pharmacotherapy focuses on symptom diminution, psy-chosocial interventions may provide emotional support and address particular deficits associ-ated with schizophrenia. Psychosocial treatments are interpersonal and call on various roles ofthe clinician: a manager to coordinate the services available within a treatment system, a teacherto provide education about the patient’s disorder and how to cope with it, a friendly other toprovide support and encouragement, a trained therapist to provide strategies for interpersonalenrichment, and a physician to provide biological treatments. These roles and therapeutic op-portunities come in many forms and settings, e.g., individual, group, family. The choice of psy-chosocial approaches and particular interventions depends on the particular needs of thepatient at various phases of his or her life and illness.
The goals and tasks of these treatments vary widely, depending on the individual patient,
disorder, and life situation. The central components of psychosocial treatment are described inthe earlier section on psychiatric management (see Section II.D.2, “Psychosocial T reatments inthe Stable Phase”). The overall goals are to minimize vulnerability and stress and to maximizeadaptive capacities and functioning while enhancing social supports.
The evidence supporting psychosocial treatments is quite variable and generally does not
correspond well with actual patterns of practice. In order to foster a more evidence-based ap-proach to the selection and application of psychosocial interventions, this section is organizedsuch that the interventions with the best evidence are discussed first for emphasis, followed bydiscussions of treatments that may be widely used but for which scientific evidence of effective-ness is minimal or lacking.
1. Psychosocial treatments with substantial evidence bases 
a) Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT)PACT includes both case management and active treatment interventions by one team usinga highly integrated approach. This program is designed specifically for the marginally adjustedand poorly functioning person with schizophrenia to help prevent relapse and maximize socialand vocational functioning. It uses an individually tailored treatment program in the commu-nity that is based on an assessment of each person’s deficits in coping skills, assets, and require-ments for community living (181, 1205). Treatment takes place through teams working 24hours a day, 7 days a week, and most treatment is delivered in patients’ homes, neighborhoods,and places of work. Staff members assist patients in daily living tasks, such as clothes launder-ing, shopping, cooking, grooming, budgeting, and using transportation. In addition, patientsare given sustained and intensive assistance in finding a job, schooling, or a sheltered workshopplacement; staff members maintain their contact with the patient after these placements to re-solve crises and conflicts and to help prevent relapse. Staff members also guide patients in con-structive use of leisure time and in social skills.
The key elements in PACT are emphasizing the patients’ strengths in adapting to community
life (rather than focusing on psychopathology); providing support and consultation to patients’natural support networks (e.g., family members, employers, friends and peers, and communityagencies); and providing assertive outreach to ensure that patients remain in the treatment pro-gram. Medication adherence is emphasized, as well as ready access to a psychiatrist. Persons withschizophrenia who are marginally functioning and/or poorly adherent to treatment may benefitfrom such a comprehensive approach. Others who are more able to function in the communityand who are adherent to treatment do not need such extensive services.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 105Controlled studies have shown the efficacy of PACT in improving symptom severity (1206),
reducing the length of hospitalizations, and improving living conditions (163–166, 181,
1207–1211). There have been replications of these results in several U.S. locales and in othercountries (1212, 1213).
Although it is not clear which particular elements in the PACT program are most essential
for positive outcomes, evidence is strongest for programs that closely follow the original PACTmodel, including maintenance of a patient-staff ratio of approximately 10:1 (1214). Otherpublic mental health systems have attempted to apply PACT principles, but unfortunately,many do not have adequate resources to carry out such a program. Nonetheless, creative real-location of resources within a system can strengthen PACT programs (1215, 1216). An evi-dence-based practices project sponsored by SAMHSA is developing a resource kit on assertivecommunity treatment (draft version available at http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/act_c.pdf).
b) Family interventions
A guiding principle is that the patient’s family members should be involved and engaged in acollaborative treatment process to the greatest extent possible. Family members generally con-tribute to the patient’s care and require education, guidance, and support, as well as training tohelp them optimize their caretaking role and to improve their own well-being. Clinicians mustunderstand that families often experience considerable stress and burdens in providing suchcaretaking. For these purposes, “family” should be defined broadly and extend beyond bloodrelatives to include other patient- and self-defined caretakers.
All evidence-based approaches emphasize the value of family participation in treatment and
stress the importance of working together in a collaborative endeavor. The main goal of familyinterventions, referred to as “psychoeducation,” is to decrease the risk of the patient’s relapse.More recent research has emphasized other goals, such as improving patient functioning, de-creasing family burden, and improving family functioning. All effective family interventionsinclude education about the illness and its course, training in coping and problem-solving skillswithin the family, improved communication, and stress reduction. These interventions usepractical educative and behavioral methods to elicit family participation and collaboration intreatment planning, goal setting, and service delivery. All effective family interventions includesomatic treatments, such as medication, for the patient and are intended to optimize their use.
The research variants of family psychoeducation are highly structured programs that last 9
months to 2–3 years and embed the psychiatrist’s care within a multidisciplinary team ap-proach to the patient and family. While the variations in research studies on family interven-tions and their control conditions make it difficult to distill the results of the more than 20controlled studies, family programs have typically halved relapse rates (173, 174, 176, 189,1207, 1217–1231). Meta-analyses pooling data across studies have consistently shown reduc-tions in relapse rates (157, 158, 1232) and also reduced family burden (1233). The controltreatments have included individual supportive therapy, intensive case management, and med-ication alone.
More recent studies have compared different family interventions. The one consistent find-
ing is that brief interventions lasting less than 9 months have little effect and are therefore in-ferior to programs lasting 9 months or longer (157). In a multisite study (T reatment Strategiesfor Schizophrenia, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health) that used a lessintensive, once-monthly variant of family management as a control condition for a more in-tensive family management approach, significant differences in relapse rates between the con-ditions were not found (1234). Families may be seen individually (173, 174) or in multiple-family groups (1223, 1235). McFarlane (1235) found slightly better protection against relapsefrom the multiple-family groups in a controlled study. However, on the whole, the critical ele-ments of family interventions have not been precisely defined.

106 APA Practice GuidelinesThe acute phase or times of crisis may be the best time to engage the family in psychoeduca-
tional family meetings. When the patient is most ill, family members tend to be most motivated
to reach out and make contact, ask questions, and seek information to reassure and guide them.
The practicing psychiatrist should remain flexible when considering the type of family in-
tervention to offer, with the patient’s and the family’s preferences playing a large role. Struc-tured family psychoeducation approaches may be challenging to implement at mental healthagencies, and considerable organizational barriers to their implementation have been identified(1236). If a highly structured clinical program is not possible, a collaborative and supportiveapproach to families remains beneficial. Also helpful are referrals to family support organiza-tions and peer-based non-clinical programs, such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill’swidely available Family-to-Family Education Program (1237, 1238). An evidence-based prac-tices project sponsored by SAMHSA is developing a resource kit on family interventions (draftversion available at http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/fpe_pcs.pdf).
c) Supported employment
Supported employment is an approach to improve vocational functioning among persons withvarious types of disabilities, including schizophrenia (192). A crucial influence on the concep-tualization of supported employment for persons with schizophrenia and other severe mentalillnesses has been the work of Becker and Drake in the development of the Individual Place-ment and Support (IPS) model (1239). Among the key principles defining IPS are 1) servicesfocused on competitive employment, 2) eligibility based on the consumer’s choice, 3) rapid jobsearch, 4) integration of rehabilitation and mental health, 5) attention to consumers’ preferenc-es, and 6) time-unlimited and individualized support (1240). An evidence-based practicesproject sponsored by SAMHSA is developing a resource kit on supported employment (draftversion available at http://www.mentalhealthpractices.org/pdf_files/se_mhpl.pdf).
Several reviewers of the supported employment literature have reached similar conclusions
(193, 194, 1241, 1242). The major sources of evidence for supported employment include daytreatment conversion studies and randomized, controlled studies.
Four studies have examined the effectiveness of converting day treatment services to sup-
ported employment (1243–1247). During follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 18 months,43% of the patients in the converted supported employment sites were working competitively,compared to only 17% of the patients in the comparison sites that did not convert.
Nine randomized, controlled trials have compared supported employment to a variety of tra-
ditional vocational services for people with severe mental illnesses (160, 162, 1248–1253). Thesenine studies were conducted by seven independent research teams in various geographic loca-tions, representing both urban and rural communities. The studies compared newly or relativelynewly established supported employment programs to established vocational services and used avariety of measures to assess employment outcomes, including the percentage of patients whoachieve competitive employment, total wages earned, and number of weeks worked. In general,most objective indicators of employment outcomes converged toward similar conclusions. Theaverage competitive employment rate was 56% for patients in supported employment, comparedto 19% for those in comparison conditions, yielding a large mean effect size of 0.85.
A continuing challenge even for supported employment is promoting job retention; studies
have found that persons with schizophrenia experience considerable difficulties retaining jobsachieved through supported employment (162, 194). This problem appears to be related to neuro-
cognitive impairments (195), among other factors.
Further, there is no evidence that engagement in supported employment leads to stress, in-
creased symptoms, or other negative outcome (159). Evidence is inconsistent about the rela-tionship between clinical and demographic variables and successful vocational performance;therefore, it is recommended that any person with schizophrenia who expresses an interest inwork should be offered supported employment.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 107d) Cognitive behavior therapy
Cognitive behavior therapy was originally crafted for the treatment of depression and anxietydisorders (1254, 1255), but it has been modified for the treatment of schizophrenia in the pastdecade, largely by clinical investigators in the United Kingdom. The assumptions of cognitivebehavior therapy are that normal psychological processes can both maintain and weaken thefixity and severity of psychotic symptoms, especially delusions and hallucinations. Cognitivebehavior therapy is usually conducted in a one-to-one therapeutic relationship. Supportive el-ements precede and always accompany the cognitive work. An empathic and nonthreateningrelationship is built during which the patient elaborates his or her experiences with schizophre-nia. Specific symptoms are identified as problematic by the patient and/or therapist and be-come targeted for special attention in cognitive behavior therapy. The therapist does notchallenge these symptoms as irrational but helps the patient through guided questions to focuson his or her own beliefs about the symptoms and the natural coping mechanisms the patienthas elaborated to deal with the symptoms. Some of cognitive behavior therapy involves endors-ing and strengthening natural coping mechanisms; the rest involves supportively guiding thepatient to a more rational cognitive perspective about his or her symptom(s). This work mayinclude belief modification, focusing/reattribution, and normalizing the psychotic experience,among other strategies (170).
In belief modification, evidence for a delusional belief is gently challenged in reverse order
to the strength to which the delusion is held. Focusing/reattribution especially targets chronicauditory hallucinations. The therapist encourages the patient to elaborate his or her experiencewith the hallucination in exhaustive detail, in the process highlighting how the symptom relatesto the patient’s daily life and ultimately helping the patient reattribute the hallucination to aninternal source. In normalizing the patient’s psychotic experience, the therapist helps the pa-tient see that his or her symptoms are embedded within the stressful vicissitudes of daily life,thus making them appear more normal and less “crazy.”
Several randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of cognitive behavior therapy in
schizophrenia have been conducted (356, 1256–1272). This research has been reviewed exten-sively (158, 168, 170, 188, 1273–1276). Overall, the data support the efficacy of cognitive be-havior therapy for reducing the frequency and severity of positive symptoms and the distressassociated with these symptoms. Furthermore, these gains appear to continue over time. Thebenefits do not appear to extend to relapse, rehospitalization, or social functioning. Further, itshould be noted that treatment refusal and dropout rates are high for cognitive behavior therapy,perhaps because weekly one-to-one meetings amount to therapeutic overload for many chronicpatients with high levels of negative symptoms. Persons with schizophrenia or delusional disor-der who appear to benefit from cognitive behavior therapy are largely chronic outpatients withtreatment-resistant (and often distressing) delusions and/or hallucinations. The interventionranges in duration from weeks to years; usually several months are required. Cognitive behaviortherapy manuals are available, but application typically requires supervised training.
e) Social skills training
Social skills training is defined by the use of behavioral techniques or learning activities thatenable patients to acquire instrumental and affiliative skills in domains required to meet theinterpersonal, self-care, and coping demands of community life (1277). The goal of social skillstraining is to remedy specific deficits in patients’ role functioning. Thus, training is targetedrather than broad, and it is a highly structured approach that involves systematically teachingpatients specific behaviors that are critical for success in social interactions. Social skills trainingcan also include teaching patients how to manage antipsychotic medications, identify side ef-fects, identify warning signs of relapse, negotiate medical and psychiatric care, express theirneeds to community agencies, and interview for a job. Social skills training can also be effectivein increasing the use of specific social behaviors such as gaze and voice volume. Skills are taught

108 APA Practice Guidelinesthrough a combination of the therapist’s modeling (demonstration); the patient’s role playing,
usually to try out a particular skill in a simulated interaction; positive and corrective feedbackto the patient; and homework assignments, by which the patient can practice a skill outside thetraining session. Social skills training can be provided individually, but it is almost always con-ducted in small groups of six to eight patients, for cost reasons and so that patients can learnfrom one another. Large groups (more than 10 patients) are not advised, as patients do not haveadequate opportunity to rehearse.
Clinical trials have supported the efficacy of social skills training (149, 150, 173, 542, 1217,
1277–1292). With the exception of a recent meta-analysis (168), reviews have also endorsedsocial skills training (167, 169, 1293, 1294).
It is evident that patients with schizophrenia can learn a wide variety of social and indepen-
dent living skills. Follow-up evaluations lasting up to 1 year showed good retention of the skillsthat were taught earlier (149, 150, 1278, 1282). When patients attempted to document theuse of skills learned in the clinic in their natural environments, the results suggested generali-zation, but much more research is needed (1278, 1286).
While social skills training may have a positive effect on social role functioning (1283,
1295), it is not effective for reducing symptoms or preventing relapse (169). There are severalreports of controlled studies in which social skills training significantly reduced relapse ratesand symptom levels (1285, 1286), but more research is needed to document the extent towhich social skills training actually protects patients from relapse. In fact, a study by Hogartyet al. (173) showed a loss in prophylactic effect at 2-year follow-up.
Skills training can be implemented in individual and group settings with patients, their fam-
ilies, or both. Patients selected for training should have moderate to severe deficits in socialfunctioning; better-functioning patients require other approaches. There are a number of use-ful tools and guides for learning how to implement social skills training, including severalteaching modules with a trainer’s manual, a participant’s workbook, and demonstration videos(169, 1296).
f) Programs of early intervention to delay or prevent relapse
The use of early intervention with the appearance of prodromal symptoms to relapse is one partof psychiatric management that can be effective in preventing rehospitalization. Studies haveshown that relapse is usually preceded by the appearance of prodromal symptoms, which maylast a few days, several weeks, or longer. The prodromal phase of relapse usually consists ofmoderate to severe dysphoric symptoms, such as tension and nervousness, eating less, difficultyconcentrating and remembering, trouble sleeping, and depression, and it may also include mildpsychotic symptoms and idiosyncratic behaviors (19, 375, 377, 806, 1297–1304). Such chang-es preceding relapse indicate either the emergence of new symptoms or increases in symptomsthat were already present at baseline. In addition to changes in symptoms, changes in observ-able behaviors are noted by some patients and families. Examples include social withdrawal,wearing makeup in excessive or bizarre ways, and loss of concern about one’s appearance. Con-trolled studies have demonstrated that specific programs to educate patients and families aboutprodromal symptoms and early intervention when symptoms occur can be helpful in reducingrelapse rates (19, 220, 682, 807, 1305–1307).
2. Psychosocial treatments with very limited evidence bases
a) Personal therapyAs developed by Hogarty and colleagues (185–187), personal therapy is an individualizedlong-term psychosocial intervention provided to patients with schizophrenia with a weekly tobimonthly frequency within the larger framework of a treatment program that provides phar-macotherapy, family work (when a family exists), and multiple levels of both material and psy-

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 109chological support. The primary objective of personal therapy is to achieve and maintain
clinical stability in patients who are at risk for future relapses and functional disabilities. Theapproach is carefully tailored to the patient’s phase of recovery from an acute episode and thepatient’s residual level of symptom severity, disability, and vulnerability to relapse. Personaltherapy is delivered in three distinct phases that match the patient’s level of clinical recoveryand social/instrumental reintegration. Patients graduate to the next phase only if and whenthey have managed and stabilized at the prior phase. The therapy is therefore flexible, phaserelevant, and sensitive to the dangers of environmental overload (including overload within thetherapeutic environment). Another operational principle is that recovery requires time and dis-order-appropriate treatment. As such, personal therapy is a long-term endeavor, with each phaselasting several months to 1–2 years. Although the initial results of Hogarty’s seminal work onpersonal therapy are very promising, there have been no replications of this study.
b) Group therapies
The group therapies include a range of modalities, such as psychoeducation groups, social skillstraining groups, group counseling, and group psychotherapy, with some groups providing ablend of these modalities. The goals of group therapy are enhancements of problem solving,goal planning, social interactions, and medication and side effect management (1308). Kanas(1309, 1310) suggests that groups should focus on “here-and-now” issues and can be effectivein increasing patients’ coping skills, including the ability to cope with psychotic symptoms. Inaddition, group approaches may aid in teaching persons with schizophrenia interpersonal andcoping skills and in providing a supportive social network for patients who tend to be sociallyisolated. Group meetings on a weekly basis are also a time-efficient way of monitoring patientsfor the onset of prodromal symptoms (19).
The evidence for the efficacy of group therapy in schizophrenia is not strong (163, 1308,
1311–1317). Most studies of outpatient and inpatient group therapy were conducted in the1970s; there have been few recent studies. A number of well-controlled studies involving stableoutpatients indicate that there is very modest evidence that group therapy can be effective inimproving social adjustment (1318–1321) and coping skills (1316). For hospitalized patientsin the acute phase of illness, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of insight-oriented grouppsychotherapy and some evidence that it may be harmful (1322). However, supportive groupsmay be useful in helping patients learn to cope with their symptoms, practice relating to othersin a controlled environment, and develop a therapeutic alliance with the treatment team (1310,1323, 1324).
The criteria for selection of patients for groups are derived from clinical experience; patients
must have sufficient stability and enough reality testing that they can meaningfully participate(the exception may be previous group members who may benefit from group support whilebeing stabilized after an acute episode). Exclusion criteria include constant preoccupation withhallucinations or delusions (especially paranoid), severe thought disorganization, and very poorimpulse control. Higher functioning outpatients may benefit from interaction-oriented grouptherapy, while poorly functioning patients who may be overstimulated may benefit more fromgroup approaches that attempt to reprogram cognitive and behavioral deficits (1325). Thereshould be flexible use of adjunctive individual sessions, especially in times of crisis, for patientswhose primary treatment mode is group therapy. It is generally recommended that a groupshould consist of six to eight patients (1321). A larger number of patients can be assigned to agroup if some members do not attend sessions regularly (1326).
c) Programs of early detection and intervention to treat schizophrenia at or before onset
The early course of schizophrenia includes a premorbid stage, a prodromal stage, and a first-episode stage of illness. The premorbid phase refers to an asymptomatic period that may, in aminority of patients, include subtle and stable “neurodevelopmental” deficits in motor, social,

110 APA Practice Guidelinesand/or intellectual functioning. While deficits usually mark a vulnerability to developing psy-
chosis, they possess little if any ability to predict later development of psychosis (unpublished1997 manuscript by P . Jones and J. van Os).
Developmental changes usually associated with adolescence may accelerate neurobiological
processes (e.g., cortical-cortical synaptic pruning) that can become expressed symptomaticallyas neurodegeneration leading to the prodromal phase of disorder. The first signs of disorder areusually functional, not symptomatic, and consist of deficits in social and intellectual function-ing and organizational abilities. Prodromal “symptoms” ultimately emerge alongside functionaldecline between 1 and 24 months before onset of an initial episode of illness. Nonspecific andnegative symptoms usually develop first, followed by attenuated positive symptoms. In the yearbefore onset, especially the last 4–6 months, symptoms accelerate in number and intensity.Their characteristic schizophrenic-like phenomenology (e.g., ideas of reference, paranoid ide-ation, unusual or alien thoughts, unexplained sounds) becomes more apparent, and ultimatelypsychosis ensues (675, 676, 718, 1327–1330). Criteria that are diagnostic of a prodromal syn-drome have been articulated (1331–1333). These criteria predict conversion to psychosis with-in a year with high frequency, e.g., between 36% and 54% of such samples (1334, 1335).
Early intervention has two aims: 1) to treat active psychotic or prodromal symptoms and
2) to prevent future deterioration and further course progression toward chronicity. Postonset,early intervention targets the duration of untreated psychosis in hopes of reducing future sever-ity and chronicity and preventing the extensive collateral damage that results from active dis-order, such as discrimination, social shunning, and poor treatment alliance and adherence(tertiary prevention). Preonset or prodromal phase intervention targets all of the previouslymentioned aims plus delaying onset (secondary prevention, reducing prevalence) or preventingonset (primary prevention, reducing incidence).
Because active psychosis is sometimes lethal and often socially destructive, the rationale for
treating the symptoms of psychosis as close to onset as possible is compelling (251). Evidencealso suggests that existing treatments might affect the natural course of psychosis beyond con-trolling symptoms. Numerous studies demonstrate significant correlations of earlier interven-tion (medication and/or psychosocial) after onset with more rapid treatment response andbetter longer-term outcome (reviewed by McGlashan [254, 1336, 1337]). Not all studies findthis correlation, however, and a causal relationship between postonset early intervention andbetter prognosis has yet to be demonstrated using controlled designs (1338, 1339).
More compelling evidence of the benefit of early intervention comes from recent studies in
the prodromal phase. McGorry et al. (262) randomly assigned operationally defined, prodro-mally symptomatic, high-risk patients to receive one of two open-label treatments. The en-riched treatment group received second-generation antipsychotics, cognitive behavior therapyemphasizing stress management, and basic support. The control group received basic supportwithout medication. At 6 months, significantly more patients in the control group had con-verted to psychosis. McGlashan et al. (263) randomly assigned a similarly defined symptomaticprodromal population (1340) to receive second-generation antipsychotics or placebo in a dou-ble-blind design. The study found a significant drug effect on prodromal symptoms at 8 weeks(264) and beyond, up to 1 year (1341).
Overall, the evidence to date indicates that early intervention in psychosis has tertiary pre-
ventive benefit and suggests that it also has secondary preventive benefit. Several more studiesare necessary before treatment recommendations are appropriate; however, two strategies areclear: 1) first-episode psychosis should be treated as soon as possible and 2) persons who meetthe criteria for being prodromally symptomatic and at risk for psychosis in the near futureshould be assessed carefully and monitored frequently until their symptoms either remit spon-taneously, evolve into schizophrenia, or evolve into another diagnosable and treatable mentaldisorder.

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 111d) Patient education
While patient education must clearly be a part of standard medical practice and is requiredmedicolegally as part of the informed consent process, it has not been clear just how best toprovide this education and whether the provision of education actually improves patients’knowledge and changes patients’ behavior (30). Over the last few years different types of pa-tient education have been subjected to empirical study (11, 1270, 1342–1346). These so-callededucational approaches employed a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and psychological strate-gies as well. Studies conducted to date provide modest evidence that group approaches improvesocial functioning (1343) and that interventions focused on medication adherence achievetheir intended effect (11, 1270, 1346). However, at this point no specific educational approachcan be recommended.
e) Case management
A common observation has been that patients often “fall through the cracks” between differentcommunity agencies or program elements and do not receive needed care. T o remedy thissituation, a case management function has been developed. Either several members of a teamor one staff member can be assigned to be the case manager, ensuring that patients receive co-ordinated, continuous, and comprehensive services. For example, the case manager may ac-company a patient to a welfare agency, visit the home if a clinical appointment is missed, orconvene a meeting of workers from different agencies serving the patient to formulate an over-all treatment plan in conjunction with the psychiatrist.
Results of controlled studies of the effects of case management have yielded inconsistent
findings, probably because of methodological problems in design, including 1) lack of specifi-cation of the case management intervention, 2) poor characterization of the patient popula-tion, 3) inadequacy of outcome measures, 4) inadequate length of the program, and 5) lack ofspecification of community context (1347). A major problem that has arisen in communitymental health planning is that some public programs have developed case management serviceswithout having adequate treatment resources for optimal patient care. Problems in implemen-tation also occur when case managers function independently and are not well integrated intothe treatment team.
Recent research has focused on the effectiven ess of specific models of case management.
One approach has been to develop “enhanced” case management programs, either by loweringthe caseloads of staff members (1348–1350), emphasizing a team model (1348, 1351–1353),or augmenting the usual services of case managers with those of additional clinician experts(1354–1356). These enhancements have been found to improve outcomes in some studies.
f) Cognitive remediation and therapy
The cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia have assumed an increasingly central rolein explaining the disability associated with the disorder. Distractibility, memory problems, lackof vigilance, attentional deficits, and limitations in planning and decision making characterizethese cognitive impairments. Cognitive remediation strategies have attempted to address theseproblems using restorative, compensatory, and environmental approaches to treatment. The re-storative model emphasizes direct elimination of impairments by correction of underlying cog-nitive deficits. Compensatory strategies attempt to help patients “work around” their deficits,while environmental approaches manipulate the environment to decrease cognitive demandson patients (1357). An underlying premise of these cognitive approaches is that they not onlywill have direct benefit but will increase the ability of patients to profit from other therapeuticapproaches and improve social and other aspects of functioning.
Numerous experimental trials have demonstrated that relatively brief, frequently computer-
assisted training programs can improve patients’ performance on neuropsychological tests(1207, 1358–1371). However, these studies, while promising, failed to demonstrate durability

112 APA Practice Guidelinesand generalizability, failed to control for medication use, and have involved a relatively small
number of subjects overall (1207). In one study with encouraging findings, cognitive remediationwas paired with work therapy and treatment was sustained over 6 months (1372). Comparedwith work therapy alone, cognitive remediation yielded significantly greater improvements asmeasured by neuropsychological tests of executive function and working memory. Workingmemory effects endured 6 months after the conclusion of treatment (1373). Nevertheless, cog-nitive remediation must still be regarded as experimental and cannot yet be recommended aspart of routine practice. The few studies that focus on compensatory and environmental strat-egies bear similarities to psychosocial interventions that provide case management. Velliganand colleagues developed cognitive adaptation training (1374, 1375). This compensatory ap-proach improved symptoms, motivation, and functioning, but these findings need to be repli-cated before such an approach can be recommended.
3. Self-help groups
Patients and their families are taking an increasingly active role in the treatment process. Theirgoals include increasing their influence on treatment planning and implementation, becomingless dependent on professionals, decreasing the discrimination associated with mental illness,and working to achieve adequate support for treatment and research in mental illness. Con-sumer organizations fall into three major categories (consumer-run or -operated services, con-sumer partnership services, and consumers as employees), each with its own membership,purpose, and philosophy (1376). Patients and families should be informed about the existenceof these organizations.
a) Patient and self-help treatment organizations
Peer support is social, emotional, and sometimes instrumental support that is mutually offeredor provided by persons having a mental health condition (e.g., consumers of mental healthservices) to others sharing a similar mental health condition to bring about a desired social orpersonal change (196). P eer support may be either financially compensated or voluntary . Aconsumer in this context is an individual with severe mental illness who is or was a user or recip-ient of mental health services and who identifies him- or herself as such (203).
The oldest and most pervasive of peer support types is self-help groups. Although there are
groups that cover most mental health-related problems, the most noted ones that are relevantto schizophrenia are GROW, Recovery, Inc., Schizophrenics Anonymous, National Depressiveand Manic Depressive Association groups, double-trouble groups (for those with both sub-stance use disorders and other mental disorders), and Emotions Anonymous. Until very recent-ly these groups were required to be face-to-face (196). However , Internet online supportgroups, with no face-to-face interaction, have come into existence (1377).
Based largely on uncontrolled studies of self-help groups for persons with severe mental ill-
ness, Davidson et al. (197) concluded that self-help groups seem to improve symptoms and in-crease participants’ social networks and quality of life. Specifically, Galanter (1378) evaluatedRecovery, Inc.; Kennedy evaluated GROW (unpublished 1989 manuscript of M. Kennedy);and Kurtz (1379) evaluated the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association withregard to hospitalizations. All found reductions in hospitalizations and, in one instance, shorterhospitalization when consumers were hospitalized (unpublished 1989 manuscript of M.Kennedy). In addition, these studies, along with Raiff’s (198) study of Recovery, Inc., deter-mined that members had improved coping, greater acceptance of illness, improved medicationadherence, lower levels of worry, and higher satisfaction with their health. Further, in a studyby Powell et al. (200), self-help participation resulted in improved daily functioning and im-proved illness management. Furthermore, longer term participants have better outcomes (198,199, and outcomes are better when participants are involved in operating the group rather thanjust attending the group (200).

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 113Within the realm of consumer-provided or -delivered services are consumer-run or -operated
services, consumer partnership services, and consumers as employees. Consumer-run or -oper-
ated services are services that are planned, operated, administered, and evaluated by consumers(201, 202). Examples of consumer-operated services include drop-in centers, club houses, crisisservices, vocational and employment services, consumer compeer services, psychosocial educa-tional services, and peer support programs, such as Friends Connection in Philadelphia (207),where consumers with dual diagnoses are matched with recovering consumers. Those serviceprograms that are not freestanding legal entities but share the control of the operation of theprogram with nonconsumers are categorized as consumer partnerships. Consumer employeesare individuals who fill positions designated for consumers as well as consumers who are hiredinto traditional mental health positions. When consumers are hired into existing mainstreampositions, to be considered a consumer employee, the individual must fulfill the definition ofa consumer, which includes publicly identifying him- or herself as a consumer. Frequently,these designated consumer positions are adjuncts to traditional mental health services, such asa case manager aid position. Examples of specially designated consumer positions are peer com-panion, peer advocate, consumer case manager, peer specialist, and peer counselor. The term“prosumer” has also come into use. It refers to a person who is both a consumer and a profes-sional, such as a trained psychologist who identifies him- or herself as a consumer (1380).
Reviews of peer support/consumer-provided services specifically for persons with severe
mental illness have generated positive but somewhat tentative results, given the infancy of theresearch area (197, 203, 204). Consumer-provided services have been found to be as effectiveas or more effective than services provided by nonconsumers (1381, 1382). T wo studies usingexperimental or quasi-experimental designs found reduced use of hospitalization and/or crisisservices associated with peer support (207, 208). In the study by Klein et al., recipients of theconsumer-delivered services also had improved social functioning, reduced substance use, andimproved quality of life. In a randomized study, consumers assigned to a condition in which aconsumer assisted in postdischarge network services had fewer and shorter hospitalizations, rel-ative to comparison subjects, and functioned in the community without utilizing mental healthservices (205). The addition of a peer specialist to an intensive case management team, com-pared to addition of a nonconsumer specialist to the team, was associated with gains in someaspects of quality of life, fewer significant life problems, and improved self-esteem and socialsupport among consumers (1383). Other less rigorously designed studies also found fewer hos-pitalizations for those served by consumers (206, 209). A consumer employment program re-sulted in higher rates of employment, higher earnings, and a tendency toward better vocationalrehabilitation outcomes for program participants, compared with consumers who did not re-ceive peer-supported vocational services (1384). Similarly, recipients of a consumer-operatedemployment program obtained employment at higher rates than found in usual employmentservices (1385).
b) Relative organizations
Family associations have taken on very important roles in supporting research, providing edu-cation, and supporting the families of the mentally ill (1386–1388).
The myriad services provided by family associations include (but are not limited to):
 Education about mental illness—for the public, as well as for professionals who do not
specialize in psychiatric disorders.
 Support for research on family services—not only by raising money directly but also by
advocating for government funds (1237). The National Alliance for Research on Schizo-
phrenia and Affective Disorders, NAMI in the United States, and other associations inEurope have helped to fund and support research projects.

114 APA Practice Guidelines In-depth education for families. This education includes not only help lines and literature
for patients and families who call with questions about medication, physicians, or commu-
nity services but also information about the long-term treatment of the major psychiatricdisorders. NAMI’s Family-to-Family Education Program is a specific example of an orga-nized educational program offered free to families. This program has been shown to reducefamilies’ subjective burden of illness and improve their well-being (1238).
 Advocacy for the rights of the mentally ill by means of legal action. Crisis lines and web sites (1389). Centers where consumers can meet, find support, and share their feelings with other
families without (what they perceive as) “interference” from mental health professionals.Specific support groups are available for siblings and for families of children or adolescentswith schizophrenia.
Studies have suggested that helping families educate and empower themselves and helping
them to become more involved in service delivery results in better outcomes for the mentallyill family members (1390, 1391).
PART C:
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The ultimate goal of treatment is to minimize the effects of illness and to enable patients to livefull, productive, and rewarding lives. This goal remains elusive for many persons with schizo-phrenia. Not only do most persons not receive the full range of evidence-based treatments, buteven the best treatments currently available do not enable most patients the opportunity forfull and productive lives that they might have experienced without the illness. Available treat-ments focus primarily on the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and are reasonably effectiveat controlling these symptoms in the majority of patients. Most patients experience symptomreduction with pharmacotherapy, and relapse rates are reduced by more than half with main-tenance treatment. Certain family intervention approaches further reduce relapse rates, and se-lected psychosocial treatments appear beneficial for occupational and social functioning.Despite efficacious treatment, most patients remain symptomatic and vulnerable to relapse.Persistent impairments are common, and long-term outcomes, while heterogeneous, still rep-resent significant morbidity for most patients. Outcomes in other domains, especially the def-icit symptoms and impaired functional status, remain unsatisfactory. This situationunderscores the need for several research priorities.
Basic research is essential to provide a better understanding of the etiologies and mecha-
nisms of these impairments and to develop treatment technologies derived from new knowl-edge. It is likely that the schizophrenia syndrome is heterogeneous, and hence future treatmentdevelopment must be informed through a better understanding of the various components ofthe syndrome. In particular, attention must be directed toward understanding the deficit syn-drome and neurocognitive impairments that account for many of the disabling effects of theillness. Major breakthroughs in prevention or treatment will likely depend on advances in basicknowledge about brain function.
Intervention research must be informed by advances in basic neuroscience so that new treat-
ments more directly affect these aspects of the syndrome that remain largely resistant to currenttreatments. Priority must be given to pharmacological and psychosocial interventions that address

Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia 115functional impairments and especially to combined treatment approaches that optimize brain
function as well as opportunities for patients to take advantage of improved capacity. Interventionresearch is needed to examine the relative efficacy of available treatments, especially options thatrepresent substantial cost differentials. Research should continue on psychosocial interventionsthat show promise when added to antipsychotic medications. These interventions include familyinterventions, disease-specific forms of psychological treatments, skills training, cognitive therapy,supported employment, and personally tailored combinations of these modalities. Given the cru-cial importance of adequate housing, research is needed to examine the effectiveness of variousapproaches to promoting stable, high-quality housing, including the matching of patients tohousing resources on the basis of clinical and social characteristics.
Research into early detection and treatment of schizophrenia is also important to determine
whether applying existing pharmacological and psychosocial interventions earlier in the courseof the disorder provides added efficacy or has the potential for secondary or tertiary prevention.
Clinical research should also attend to a fuller range of outcomes, beyond symptom relief,
including functional status and quality of life. These outcomes represent the range of prioritiesby various “stakeholders”: researchers, practitioners, patients, families, and payers. A morecomprehensive approach to outcomes assessment will ensure that studies are viewed as relevantand informative to these various stakeholders, who function as effective advocates at variouslevels. Furthermore, we must ask for whom outcomes are improved. Clinical research on treat-ment-relevant subgroups will aid in better treatment matching and more judicious allocationof resources. Genetics research also has the potential for providing data to match patients withoptimal treatments. In short, we need to know which treatments enhance which outcomes forwhich patients.
Clinical services research should address the translation of efficacious interventions into
practice. Several questions must be addressed: To what degree are efficacious treatments used inpractice? Who receives them, and what are the patient-related and provider-related determi-nants of these practice patterns? What is the cost-effectiveness in practice of interventions withknown efficacy? What are the barriers to the adoption of efficacious treatments in practice, andhow can these be overcome? What strategies for changing practices are most effective? Servicesystems research must tackle these questions at the system level and, in addition, address thequestion of which organizational and financing strategies promote services that incorporate themost effective treatments. Finally, services research needs to address the current failure of treat-ment systems to ensure that evidence-based treatments are properly implemented and offeredto those who can benefit from them. In addition, services research needs to examine the rela-tionships between patterns of service use and illness characteristics, especially the effect of cog-nitive deficits on patients’ capacity to gain access to and use services. Such research should alsoevaluate the effects of interventions in improving patients’ capacity to use services appropriately.
