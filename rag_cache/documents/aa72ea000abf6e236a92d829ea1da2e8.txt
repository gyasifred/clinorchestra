Among patients with aortic stenosis who are at intermediate or high risk for death 
with surgery, major outcomes are similar with transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic-valve replacement. There is insufficient evidence regard -
ing the comparison of the two procedures in patients who are at low risk.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk to undergo either TAVR with transfemoral placement of a balloon-expandable valve or surgery. The primary end point was a composite of death, stroke, or rehospitaliza -
tion at 1 year. Both noninferiority testing (with a prespecified margin of 6 percent -
age points) and superiority testing were performed in the as-treated population.
RESULTS
At 71 centers, 1000 patients underwent randomization. The mean age of the patients was 73 years, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score was 1.9% (with scores ranging from 0 to 100% and higher scores indicating a greater risk of death within 30 days after the procedure). The Kaplan–Meier estimate of the rate of the primary composite end point at 1 year was significantly lower in the TAVR group than in the surgery group (8.5% vs. 15.1%; absolute difference, −6.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −10.8 to −2.5; P<0.001 for noninferiority; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.79; P = 0.001 for superiority). At 30 days, TAVR 
resulted in a lower rate of stroke than surgery (P = 0.02) and in lower rates of death 
or stroke (P = 0.01) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (P<0.001). TAVR also resulted 
in a shorter index hospitalization than surgery (P<0.001) and in a lower risk of a poor treatment outcome (death or a low Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score) at 30 days (P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in major vascular complications, new permanent pacemaker insertions, or moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low surgical risk, the rate of the composite of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year was significantly lower with TAVR than with surgery.

The role of transcatheter aortic-
valve replacement (TAVR) in the treatment of patients with severe, symptomatic aortic 
stenosis has evolved on the basis of evidence from clinical trials.
1-11 Previous randomized trials of 
TAVR with both balloon-expandable valves1-7 and 
self-expanding valves8-11 showed that, in patients 
who were at intermediate or high risk for death with surgery, TAVR was either superior or nonin -
ferior to standard therapies, including surgical aortic-valve replacement; these results led to an expansion of guideline recommendations for TAVR.
12,13 Moreover, technological enhancements 
and procedural simplification have contributed to increased use of TAVR, such that more patients now undergo TAVR than isolated surgery for aor -
tic-valve replacement in the United States.
14 How-
ever, most patients with severe aortic stenosis are at low surgical risk,
15 and there is insufficient 
evidence regarding the comparison of TAVR with surgery in such patients.
16,17 We report the find -
ings of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 3 trial, in which TAVR was compared with surgery in low-risk patients.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The PARTNER 3 trial was a multicenter, ran -
domized trial in which TAVR with transfemoral placement of a third-generation balloon-expand -
able valve was compared with standard surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis and a low risk of death with sur -
gery. A list of participating sites and investigators is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, avail -
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial protocol, available at NEJM.org, was de -
signed by the trial sponsor (Edwards Lifesciences) and the steering committee, with guidance from the Food and Drug Administration. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each site. The sponsor funded all trial-related activities and participated in site selection, data collection and monitoring, and statistical analy -
sis. The principal investigators (the first two au -
thors) and steering committee monitored all as -
pects of trial conduct. The principal investigators had unrestricted access to the data, prepared all drafts of the manuscript, and vouch for the com -
pleteness and accuracy of the data and analyses and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. De -tails regarding the trial design and administrative data are provided in Sections A and B and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Patients
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they had severe calcific aortic stenosis and were considered to be at low surgical risk according to the results of clinical and anatomical assess -
ment, including a Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score of less than 4% (with scores ranging from 0 to 100% and higher scores indicating a greater risk of death within 30 days after the procedure) and agreement by the site heart team and the trial case review committee. Patients had to be eligible for TAVR with transfemoral placement of the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 system (Edwards Life -
sciences). Patients with clinical frailty (as deter -
mined by the heart team), bicuspid aortic valves, or other anatomical features that increased the risk of complications associated with either TAVR or surgery were excluded. Details regarding inclu -
sion and exclusion criteria are provided in Section C in the Supplementary Appendix. All the patients provided written informed consent.
Randomization and Procedures
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to undergo either TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 system or surgical aortic-valve replacement with a commercially available bioprosthetic valve. Ran -
domization was conducted with the use of an electronic system, with block sizes of four, and was stratified according to site.
The SAPIEN 3 system and the procedures for 
TAVR and surgery have been described previ -
ously
18; details are provided in Section D in the 
Supplementary Appendix. All TAVR procedures used the transfemoral access route. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty before and after TAVR was per -
formed at the operator’s discretion. Patients re -
ceived aspirin (81 mg) and clopidogrel (≥300 mg) before TAVR and were advised to continue taking these medications for at least 1 month after the procedure.
End Points
The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year after the procedure. All the patients un -
derwent neurologic examinations at baseline and

at 30 days. Patients who had suspected stroke after 
the procedure underwent serial neurologic exami -
nations, including assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after the event. Rehos -
pitalization was defined as any hospitalization re -
lated to the procedure, the valve, or heart failure.
Key secondary end points were prespecified 
for hierarchical testing to control type 1 error. These included stroke, a composite of death or stroke, and new-onset atrial fibrillation at 30 days, as well as the length of the index hospitalization and a poor treatment outcome, which was a com -
posite of death or a low Kansas City Cardiomy -
opathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall summary score (with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating fewer physical limitations and a greater feeling of well-being) at 30 days. Analyses of change in New York Heart Associa -
tion (NYHA) functional class, 6-minute walk-test distance, and KCCQ summary score were also performed. A list of all the secondary safety and effectiveness end points and their definitions are provided in Sections E and F in the Supplemen -
tary Appendix. All components of the primary end point and key secondary end points were adjudi -
cated by a clinical events committee whose mem -
bers were aware of the treatment assignments.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a sample of 864 patients would provide the trial with 90% power to show the non -
inferiority of TAVR to surgery with regard to the primary end point at 1 year, assuming a Kaplan–Meier estimate of the rate of 14.6% in the TAVR group and 16.6% in the surgery group. A sample size of 1000 patients was chosen to allow for with -
drawals, crossovers, and loss to follow-up. To test for noninferiority, we determined whether the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the rate of the primary end point between the TAVR group and the surgery group was less than the prespecified noninferi -
ority margin of 6 percentage points.
If the requirement for noninferiority was met, 
testing for the superiority of TAVR to surgery with regard to the primary end point was to be performed at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The primary analysis was performed in the as-treated population, which included patients who under -
went randomization and in whom the index pro -
cedure was initiated. Sensitivity analyses of the primary end point were performed in the inten -
tion-to-treat population, as well as with the use of multiple imputation to account for missing data (Section G in the Supplementary Appendix). An analysis of the hierarchical composite of death, stroke, or rehospitalization was performed with the use of the win ratio method.
19 Prespecified 
subgroup analyses, with tests for interaction, were also performed.
There were two categories of secondary end 
points. For key secondary end points, testing for superiority was performed in a prespecified hierar -
chical order with the use of a gatekeeping method to control for multiple comparisons; P values are presented with claims of significance. For other secondary end points, analyses were performed without correction for multiple comparisons; haz -
ard ratios and 95% confidence intervals are pre -
sented without P values or claims of significance, and inferences drawn from these 95% confidence intervals may not be reproducible.
Continuous variables, which are presented as 
means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges, were compared with the use of Student’s t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical and ordinal variables, which are pre -
sented as proportions, were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Continuous variables obtained after baseline were compared with the use of analysis of covar -
iance with adjustment for the baseline measure -
ment. Time-to-event analyses were performed with the use of Kaplan–Meier estimates and were com -
pared with the use of the log-rank test. Echocar -
diographic analyses were performed in the valve-implant population, which included patients in whom the intended valve was implanted. All sta -
tistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Patients
From March 2016 through October 2017, a total of 1000 patients were enrolled at 71 sites; 979 of the patients were from the United States, 8 from Canada, 7 from Australia or New Zealand, and 6 from Japan. The patients were randomly as -
signed to undergo either TAVR (503 patients) or surgery (497 patients). The assigned procedure was performed in 950 patients (496 in the TAVR group and 454 in the surgery group), who com -

posed the as-treated population, and the intended 
valve was implanted in 948. Among the patients who did not undergo the assigned procedure (7 in the TAVR group and 43 in the surgery group), the most common reason was withdrawal from the trial (in 41 patients), mainly owing to the decision not to undergo surgery or the preference to un -
dergo surgery at a nontrial site. Details regarding enrollment, randomization, and follow-up are pro -
vided in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Characteristics of the patients at baseline were 
balanced in the two groups (Table 1, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), except for a higher percentage of patients with an NYHA class of III or IV in the TAVR group than in the surgery group (31.2% vs. 23.8%). The patients enrolled in this trial were younger (mean age, 73 years), included more men (69.3%), and had lower STS-PROM scores (mean score, 1.9%) and fewer coexisting conditions than patients enrolled in previous randomized trials of TAVR.
1-3 Baseline 
characteristics were similar in the as-treated popu -
lation and in patients who underwent randomiza -
tion and were not included in the as-treated popu -
lation (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Procedural Outcomes
The median time from randomization to the in -
dex procedure was 11 days. One TAVR procedure was converted to surgery, and one surgical pro -
cedure was aborted. Concomitant procedures were performed in 7.9% of the patients in the TAVR group and in 26.4% of the patients in the sur -
gery group. Concomitant coronary revascular -
ization was performed in 6.5% and 12.8%, re -
spectively. In the TAVR group, conscious sedation was used in 65.1% of the patients. In the surgery group, minimally invasive surgery was performed in 24.3% of the patients, and the surgical valve was 23 mm in diameter or larger in 79.9%. De -
tails regarding the procedures are provided in Tables S2 and S3 and Figure S4 in the Supple -
mentary Appendix.
There were six deaths during the index hospi -
talization, which occurred in two patients in the TAVR group and in four patients in the surgery group. Other serious intraprocedural complica -
tions that occurred in the TAVR group included implantation of a second valve, annulus rupture, coronary-artery obstruction, and ventricular per -
foration (in one patient each) (Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).Primary End Point
At 1 year, data regarding the primary end point were available for 98.4% of the patients. The composite of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization had occurred in 42 patients (8.5%) in the TAVR group as compared with 68 patients (15.1%) in the surgery group. The re -
quirements for both noninferiority and superior -
ity were met, with an absolute difference be -
tween the TAVR group and the surgery group of −6.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], −10.8 to −2.5; P<0.001 for noninferiority) and a hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.79; P = 0.001 for superiority) (Fig.  1A).
Results of an analysis performed with the use 
of the hierarchical win ratio method (win ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.76) were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Results of sensitiv -
ity analyses of the primary end point performed in the intention-to-treat population and with the use of multiple imputation for missing data were also consistent with those of the primary analy -
sis, as were results of analyses involving patients who underwent revascularization or other con -
comitant procedures and those who did not. Sub -
group analyses of the primary end point at 1 year showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect in any of the subgroups that were examined (Fig.  2). 
Details regarding these analyses are provided in Tables S6, S7, and S8 and Figure S5 in the Sup -
plementary Appendix.
Data regarding the individual components of 
the primary end point are shown in Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D, and in Table S9 in the Supplemen -
tary Appendix. At 1 year, the Kaplan–Meier esti -
mate of the rate was 1.0% in the TAVR group as compared with 2.5% in the surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.17) for death from any cause, 1.2% as compared with 3.1% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.00) for stroke, and 7.3% as compared with 11.0% (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.00) for rehospitalization.
Secondary End Points
For key secondary end points, results of prespeci -
fied hierarchical testing are shown in Table 2. At 30 days, TAVR resulted in a lower rate of stroke than surgery (0.6% vs. 2.4%; hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.88; P = 0.02) and in lower rates 
of death or stroke (1.0% vs. 3.3%; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.83; P = 0.01) and new-
onset atrial fibrillation (5.0% vs. 39.5%; hazard

bundle-branch block at 1 year was 23.7% in the 
TAVR group as compared with 8.0% in the sur -
gery group (hazard ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 2.32 to 5.08). The percentage of patients with life-threat -
ening or major bleeding was 3.6% in the TAVR group as compared with 24.5% in the surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.21). Changes from baseline in the NYHA class, 6-min -
ute walk-test distance, and KCCQ score at 30 days and 1 year are shown in Figure  3.
Echocardiographic Findings
At 30 days, the mean aortic-valve gradient was 12.8 mm Hg in the TAVR group and 11.2 mm Hg in the surgery group. The mean aortic-valve area was 1.7 cm
2 and 1.8 cm2, respectively. The 
percentage of patients with moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation did not differ signifi -
cantly between the TAVR group and the surgery group (0.8% and none, respectively, at 30 days; 0.6% and 0.5% at 1 year). The percentage of patients with mild paravalvular regurgitation at 1 year was higher with TAVR than with surgery (29.4% vs. 2.1%). There were no episodes of valve thrombosis associated with clinical events. Six asymptomatic patients (five in the TAVR group and one in the surgery group) had findings sug -
gestive of valve thrombosis, including increased valve gradients and evidence on imaging of re -
stricted leaflet motion. Details regarding echo -
cardiographic findings are provided in Tables S17 and S18 and Figures S10 through S13 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
There are three main findings of the PARTNER 3 trial. First, TAVR, performed by means of transfemoral placement of the balloon-expand -
able SAPIEN 3 system, was superior to surgery Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Composite End Point of Death from Any Cause, Stroke, or Rehospitalization.
All percentages are Kaplan–Meier estimates. Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) scores range from  
0 to 100%, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of death within 30 days after the procedure. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Ques -
tionnaire (KCCQ) overall summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer physical limitations and a greater  feeling of well-being. NYHA denotes New York Heart Association.0 20

with regard to the primary composite end point 
of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed the ro -
bustness of the results of the primary analysis. Results for the three components of the primary end point favored TAVR at both 30 days and 1 year. Second, analyses of key secondary end points, which were adjusted for multiple comparisons, showed that TAVR was associated with a sig -
nificantly lower rate of new-onset atrial fibrilla -
tion at 30 days, a shorter index hospitalization, and a lower risk of a poor treatment outcome (death or a low KCCQ score) at 30 days than sur -
gery. Third, patients who underwent TAVR had more rapid improvements in the NYHA class, 6-minute walk-test distance, and KCCQ score than those who underwent surgery.
During the past decade, recommendations for 
TAVR in patients with severe, symptomatic aor -
tic stenosis have been expanded to include strata with incrementally lower surgical risk.
12,13,20,21 
Current clinical practice has restricted the use of TAVR in patients who are at low risk and in younger patients, for whom surgery is standard therapy. Previous research that supports the use of TAVR in low-risk patients is limited, mostly consisting of retrospective, observational stud -
ies.
22-27 One randomized trial of TAVR with an early-generation self-expanding valve in 280 pa -
tients at all risk levels (>80% with an STS-PROM score of <4%) showed that TAVR was noninferior to surgery with more than 5 years of follow-up.
16 
A recent prospective series of TAVR with balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves in 200 low-risk patients without frailty from 11 U.S. centers showed no deaths or disabling strokes at 30 days.
17
In the PARTNER 3 trial, surgical outcomes 
were excellent: in the surgery group, the rate of death at 30 days was 1.1%, and the rate of a composite of death or disabling stroke at 1 year was 2.9%. Nevertheless, in the TAVR group, the rate of death at 30 days was even lower (0.4%), and the rate of death or disabling stroke at 1 year was only 1.0%. Complications that were more frequent with TAVR than with surgery in previ -
ous trials
1-3,6,28-32 occurred with similar frequency 
in the two groups in this trial, including major vascular complications, new permanent pace -
maker insertions, moderate or severe paravalvu -
lar regurgitation, and coronary-artery obstruction. Life-threatening or major bleeding occurred less frequently with TAVR than with surgery. Results for other secondary end points, including new left bundle-branch block and mild paravalvular regurgitation, favored surgery. Between-group dif -

also favored surgery, although this was not the 
case in previous randomized trials of TAVR2,3,5; 
this result was probably due to the greater use of larger surgical valves in this trial.
The most important limitation of this trial is 
that our current results reflect only 1-year out-comes and do not address the problem of long-term structural valve deterioration.
33,34 Definitive 
conclusions regarding the advantages and disad-vantages of TAVR as compared with surgery (with either bioprosthetic or mechanical valves) depend on long-term follow-up. In this trial involving younger, low-risk patients, the protocol requires clinical and echocardiographic follow-up to con-tinue for at least 10 years.
This trial has several other limitations. First, 
in this trial, as in previous TAVR trials, adjudica-tion of end points was not blinded, which could have resulted in bias in outcome assessment. Second, the results apply only to the defined trial population, which excluded patients with poor transfemoral access, bicuspid aortic valves, or other anatomical or clinical factors that in-creased the risk of complications associated with either TAVR or surgery. Third, the findings can-not be extrapolated to TAVR performed with other systems or by less experienced operators.
35,36
Fourth, more patients in the surgery group than in the TAVR group withdrew from the trial (both early and late). Fifth, missing data regarding NYHA class, 6-minute walk-test distance, KCCQ score, and follow-up echocardiograms were not fully accounted for with multiple imputation. Sixth, this analysis did not examine the rate and relevance of asymptomatic valve thrombosis.
37,38
This issue is being examined in a randomized subtrial, in which 435 patients are undergoing serial computed tomographic angiography for the detection of abnormalities in valve-leaflet function, with investigators unaware of imaging findings.
The proof-of-concept first case of TAVR per-
formed by Cribier and colleagues in 2002
39 was 
intended to open a treatment pathway for the highest-risk patients with limited therapeutic op-tions. Our findings in low-risk patients suggest that the value of TAVR as compared with surgery may be independent of risk profiles.
In conclusion, among patients with severe 
aortic stenosis who were at low risk for death with surgery, the rate of the composite of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year was signifi-cantly lower with TAVR than with surgical aortic-valve replacement.
