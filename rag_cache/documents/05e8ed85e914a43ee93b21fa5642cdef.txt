Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common health care–associated infections 
(HAIs), representing up to 40% of all HAIs.1–3 Most health care–associated UTIs (70%) are 
associated with urinary catheters, but as many as 95% of UTIs in intensive care units (ICUs) 
are associated with catheters.4,5 Approximately 20% of patients have a urinary catheter 
placed at some time during their hospital stay,6,7 especially in ICUs, in long-term care 
facilities, and increasingly in home care settings.3,4,8 The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) estimated that up to 139,000 catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs) occurred 
in US hospitals in 2007.4
CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Hospital-associated 
bloodstream infection from a urinary source has a case fatality of 32.8%.9,10 Each episode of 
CAUTI is estimated to cost $600; if associated with a bloodstream infection, costs increase 
to $2800.11 Nationally, CAUTIs result in an estimated $131 million annual excess medical 
costs.4
Moreover, in October 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
included hospital-acquired CAUTI under conditions that are no longer reimbursed for the 
extra costs of managing a patient.11 To date, there has been no measurable effect of the 
CMS policy to reduce payments for CAUTIs on CAUTI rates or preventive practices.12–14

Nevertheless, the prevention of CAUTIs has become a priority for most hospitals because 
65% to 70% of CAUTIs may be preventable.15
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CAUTIs
Likely as a result of widespread interventions occurring nationwide, rates of CAUTIs in 
ICUs reporting to the CDC decreased significantly between 1990 and 2007.4 In 2010, 
the rates of CAUTIs reported to the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) 
ranged from 4.7 per 1000 catheter-days in burn ICUs to 1.3 per 1000 catheter-days in 
medical/surgical ICUs.4 Pediatric ICUs reported similar rates of CAUTI, 2.2 to 3.9 per 
1000 catheter-days16; however, CAUTIs are infrequently identified in neonatal ICUs.17 
Inpatient wards reported rates equivalent to ICU settings, with a range from 0.2 to 3.2 per 
1000 catheter-days. Among inpatient wards, rehabilitation units had the highest rates of 
CAUTIs.5,16
Microbial Cause of CAUTIs
Most microorganisms causing CAUTIs are from the endogenous microbiota of the perineum 
that ascend the urethra to the bladder along the external surface of the catheter.18 A smaller 
proportion of microorganisms (34%) are introduced by intraluminal contamination of the 
collection system from exogenous sources, frequently resulting from cross-transmission of 
organisms from the hands of health care personnel.18,19 Approximately 15% of episodes 
of health care–associated bacteriuria occur in clusters from patient-to-patient transmission 
within a hospital.2,19 Rarely, organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus , cause UTI from 
hematogenous spread.
Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli  and Klebsiella  spp, are the most common 
pathogens associated with CAUTI; but in the ICU setting, Candida  spp (18%), Enterococcus 
spp (10%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (9%) are more prevalent (Table 1).16,20,21 
European hospitals report a similar spectrum of microorganisms associated with nosocomial 
UTIs, except for Pseudomonas  spp, which were isolated in only 7% of urine cultures.22
Among E coli  isolates reported to the NHSN from CAUTIs in ICU and non-ICU settings 
in 2009 to 2010, 29.1% and 33.5%, respectively, were resistant to fluoroquinolones.21 Many 
Enterobacteriaceae produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; 26.9% of K pneumonia/
oxytoca  and 12.3% of E coli  isolates from patients with CAUTIs were resistant to extended-
spectrum cephalosporins. Alarmingly, during this same time period, 12.5% of Klebsiella  spp 
from patients with CAUTIs were resistant to carbapenems.21 Although long-term acute care 
hospitals (LTACHs) had a prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in 
CAUTI isolates similar to that reported in ICUs, a greater percentage of LTACHs reported a 
CRE CAUTI compared with ICUs.20
Enterococci emerged as a commonly reported cause of health care–associated UTIs between 
1975 and 1984. Although the clinical significance of enterococci isolated from urine is 
questionable, urinary drainage devices serve as a reservoir for emergence and spread of 
vancomycin-resistant strains in short- and long-term acute care settings.20,21 Also rarely 
associated with complications when isolated from the urine,23 Candida  spp account for Chenoweth et al. Page 2

28% of CAUTIs reported from ICUs.20 S aureus  are an infrequent cause of CAUTI but, 
when identified, should prompt consideration for coinciding bacteremia or endocarditis.10,24 
CAUTI associated with long-term catheters are associated with 2 or more organisms in 77% 
to 95% of episodes, and 10% have more than 5 species of organisms present.3
Biofilms, composed of clusters of microorganisms and extracellular matrix (primarily 
polysaccharide materials), form on the internal and external surfaces of urinary catheters 
shortly after insertion.19,25 Typically, the biofilm is composed of one type of microorganism, 
although polymicrobial biofilms are possible. Microorganisms within the biofilm ascend 
the catheter to the bladder in 1 to 3 days. Antimicrobials penetrate into biofilms poorly, 
and microorganisms grow more slowly in biofilms, decreasing the effects of many 
antimicrobials.19,25 The microorganisms, resistance patterns, and biofilm factors mentioned 
earlier have significant implications for the management of CAUTIs.
Risk Factors for CAUTIs
Table 2 outlines major modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for CAUTI, which have 
importance for the design and implementation of interventions for the prevention of CAUTI. 
The duration of catheterization is the dominant risk factor for CAUTI.1,3,26 Women have 
a higher risk of UTI than men, and heavy bacterial colonization of the perineum increases 
that risk. Other factors that increase the risk of CAUTI include rapidly fatal underlying 
illness, more than 50 years of age, nonsurgical disease, hospitalization on an orthopedic or 
urological service, catheter inserted outside the operating room, diabetes mellitus, and serum 
creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL at the time of catheterization. Nonadherence to aseptic 
catheter care recommendations has been associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria; 
conversely, systemic antibiotics have a protective effect on bacteriuria (relative risk 2.0–
3.9).2,3 Independent risk factors for urinary tract–related bloodstream infections in patients 
with bacteriuria include neutropenia, renal disease, and male sex.27
DIAGNOSIS OF CAUTIS
Clinical diagnosis of a CAUTI is challenging because pyuria and bacteriuria are almost 
uniformly present, but neither are reliable indicators of symptomatic UTI in the setting 
of catheterization.28–31 Symptomatic UTI is defined by the presence of symptoms or 
signs referable to the urinary tract associated with significant bacteriuria.28 Fever or other 
systemic symptoms may be the only clinical indication of UTI in patients who are critically 
ill or who have spinal cord injuries.2,3 However, outside these patient populations, additional 
urinary tract-specific signs and symptoms should be sought for the diagnosis of UTI.28,30
Defining significant bacteriuria is difficult because some level of bacterial colonization 
is universal in urine from catheterized patients. Colony counts in urine as low as 102 
colony-forming units (CFU)/mL can be associated with symptoms, and colony counts of this 
level rapidly increase to more than 105 CFU/mL within 24 to 48 hours.28,32,33 Therefore, 
the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitative Research defined bacteriuria in 
catheterized patients as growth of 102 CFU/mL or more of a predominant microorganism.33 
Other guidelines have defined 103 CFU/mL as a more reasonable threshold for significant Chenoweth et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
bacteriuria, balancing the sensitivity of detecting CAUTI with the feasibility of the 
microbiology laboratory to quantify microorganisms.28
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as bacteriuria in patients without signs or symptoms 
referable to the urinary tract.28 The distinction from symptomatic UTI is clinically important 
because asymptomatic catheter-associated bacteriuria and funguria rarely result in adverse 
outcomes (eg, pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, bacteremia) and generally do not require 
treatment.30 Nevertheless, a large proportion of antimicrobials in hospitalized patients are 
prescribed for the treatment of UTIs, most often asymptomatic bacteriuria.34–36
MANAGEMENT OF CAUTIS
The treatment of asymptomatic catheter-associated bacteriuria or candiduria is not indicated 
except in patients who are at a high risk for the development of complications, such 
as pyelonephritis or bloodstream infection.37 Screening and treating pregnant women for 
asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis are recommended. In addition, patients 
undergoing genitourinary procedures likely to induce mucosal bleeding should be screened 
and treated in advance for asymptomatic bacteriuria.28,37 As with asymptomatic bacteriuria, 
asymptomatic candiduria generally does not require treatment, except in neutropenic 
patients and other high-risk patients noted earlier.38 Furthermore, because of poor specificity 
of fever and frequency of bacteriuria and funguria in hospitalized patients with urinary 
catheters, a thorough investigation for other sources of fever should be conducted before 
diagnosing a UTI.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria, persisting for 48 hours after the removal of a urinary catheter, 
has a high risk of progressing to symptomatic UTI; treatment in hospitalized women 
has been shown to decrease the risk of subsequent UTIs.39 Therefore, considering the 
treatment of women with asymptomatic bacteriuria persisting 48 hours after catheter 
removal is recommended.28,37,39 When indicated, 3 to 7 days of appropriate antimicrobial 
therapy based on culture results should be adequate for the treatment of asymptomatic 
bacteriuria.28,37
Repeated antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria during long-term catheterization is a 
significant risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms, and most of this use 
is inappropriate.34,35 A recent study reported that a 1-hour educational session reduced 
inappropriate use of antibiotic therapy for inpatients with positive urine cultures.40 In 
addition, audit and feedback to care providers decreased overdiagnosis of CAUTIs and 
associated inappropriate antibiotic use in another study.36 Educational efforts aimed at 
reducing unnecessary urine cultures (eg, pan-culturing for fever without a thorough clinical 
assessment) would also prevent the inappropriate treatment of bacteriuria and funguria.
Because of the presence of biofilm, leaving the catheter in place during the treatment 
of CAUTIs makes eradicating bacteriuria or candiduria difficult and can lead to the 
development of antimicrobial resistance. The management of symptomatic CAUTIs should 
include removing or replacing the urinary catheter if it has been in place for at least 2 
weeks.28,41 In terms of antimicrobial therapy, symptomatic CAUTIs may be treated with Chenoweth et al. Page 4
Infect Dis Clin North Am . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 October 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
7 days of appropriate antimicrobials if patients have a prompt resolution of symptoms; 
therapy should be lengthened to 10 to 14 days for those with a delayed response.28 
Initial empiric therapy should be based on local epidemiologic data regarding causative 
microorganisms of CAUTIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Once culture data become 
available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted as necessary, ideally providing the 
narrowest spectrum of coverage possible while still providing adequate treatment of the 
UTI. Symptomatic CAUTIs caused by Candida  species should be treated with 14 days of 
antifungal agents.38
PREVENTING CAUTIS
General strategies, formulated for the prevention of all HAIs, including strict adherence to 
hand hygiene, are critical for the prevention of CAUTIs.42 The urinary tract of hospitalized 
patients, especially those in an ICU setting, represents a significant reservoir for multidrug-
resistant organisms. Therefore, precautions recommended for prevention of transmission of 
multidrug-resistant organisms should be scrupulously observed in catheterized patients.43 
Limiting unnecessary use of antimicrobials, as part of an overall antimicrobial stewardship 
program, is another important general strategy to prevent the development of antimicrobial 
resistance related to urinary catheters.44
The measurement and feedback of results of interventions to the clinical care team is 
an essential component of any improvement program. The CDC NHSN CAUTI rate 
(symptomatic UTI per 1000 urinary catheter-days) is the most widely accepted measure 
for CAUTI surveillance and is endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the 
Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the Association for Professionals in 
Infection Control and Epidemiology.28,45,46 In addition, beginning in 2012, the CMS has 
required as a condition of participation that hospitals, long-term care hospitals, and inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities submit ICU CAUTI rates to the NHSN. A modified definition of 
UTI is recommended for surveillance in long-term care facilities.47 Efforts are currently 
underway to revise the CDC’s NHSN UTI surveillance definitions to improve specificity 
and clinical relevance of the measure.
However, a population-based measure, using hospital-days as the denominator, has been 
suggested as an alternative measure to assess improvement interventions at individual 
hospitals.48 Other measures, such as rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria, percentage of 
patients with indwelling catheters, percentage of catheterization with accepted indications, 
and duration of catheter use, have been used in improvement studies and collaboratives with 
good success.49
Several guidelines with specific recommendations for the prevention of CAUTIs have been 
developed or recently updated (Box 1).28,45,46,50 However, in 2005, a nationwide survey 
identified that one-third of hospitals did not conduct surveillance for UTIs, more than 
one-half did not monitor urinary catheters, and three-quarters did not monitor the duration of 
catheterization.12,51 In a follow-up study, after the enactment of the CMS nonpayment rule, 
still no CAUTI prevention practices had been adopted in more than half of the hospitals, 
except for the use of bladder ultrasound.12 Even in ICUs, only a small proportion of Chenoweth et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
surveyed sites had policies supporting bladder ultrasound (26%), catheter removal reminders 
(12%), or nurse-initiated catheter discontinuation (10%).52 The systematic adoption of 
prevention practices has begun to be observed through the use of bundles and collaboratives, 
as detailed later.49,53
A qualitative study of 12 hospitals participating in a statewide program identified barriers 
to adoption of the key interventions to reduce unnecessary use of urinary catheters. 
Common barriers included difficulty with nurse and physician engagement, patient and 
family request for indwelling catheters, and catheter insertion practices and customs in 
emergency departments.54 In addition, qualitative studies have revealed that staff variations 
of the perceived risk and perceived strength of evidence supporting preventive practices 
should be incorporated into implementation plans.55,56
Limiting Use of Urinary Catheters
The foremost strategy for CAUTI prevention is avoidance of or decreasing the duration 
of urinary catheterization. Catheter utilization varies by ICU type, with the lowest rate 
in pediatric medical ICUs (0.16 urinary catheter-days/patient-days) and the highest rates 
reported in trauma ICUs (0.80 urinary catheter-days/patient-days).16 Decreasing catheter 
utilization requires interventions at several stages of the lifecycle of the urinary catheter.26
The first stage in decreasing catheter utilization is limiting the placement of indwelling 
urinary catheters. Overall, urinary catheters are overused and the documentation surrounding 
catheterization is inconsistent7,57–59; urinary catheters are placed for inappropriate 
indications in 21% to 50% of catheterized patients.7,60 Written policies and criteria for 
indwelling urinary catheterization, based on accepted indications, is a first step in limiting 
the placement of urinary catheters; but tracking indications for catheters with feedback to 
the care team is also important (Box 2).45,50 Some hospitals have had success by targeting 
interventions for limiting the placement of urinary catheters in emergency departments and 
operating rooms, locations where the initial placement often takes place.61
Once catheters are placed, strategies for early removal become necessary to limit the 
duration of catheterization. Relying on physicians’ orders alone may be inadequate for 
the management of catheters because, in one study, 28% of physicians were unaware that 
their patient had a catheter.7 Nurse-driven interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in 
reducing the duration of catheterization.62–64 This type of intervention was implemented in 
a statewide effort that resulted in a significant decrease in catheter use and an increase in 
appropriate indications of catheters.49
Computerized physician order entry systems may offer a more cost-effective and efficient 
system to reduce both the placement of catheters and the duration of catheterization.65 A 
systematic review and meta-analysis found that urinary catheter reminder systems and stop 
orders seem to reduce the mean duration of catheterization by 37% and CAUTIs by 52%.66
Hospitals have also shown success in decreasing urinary catheter prevalence and CAUTIs 
through the multimodal interventions noted earlier.67,68 One institution used a multifaceted 
intervention, which included education, system redesign, rewards, and feedback managed Chenoweth et al. Page 6
Infect Dis Clin North Am . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 October 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
by a dedicated nurse, resulting in a marked decrease in the daily prevalence of 
urinary catheter days.67 Strategies to address barriers to the implementation of urinary 
catheterization bundles include incorporating planned toileting into other patient safety 
programs, discussing the risk of indwelling urinary catheters with patients and their families, 
and engaging emergency department personnel to ensure appropriate indications for catheter 
use are followed have been promoted.54
Perioperative Management of Urinary Catheters
Approximately 85% of patients admitted for major surgical procedures have perioperative 
indwelling catheters. Those patients catheterized longer than 2 days are significantly more 
likely to develop UTIs and are less likely to be discharged to home.69 Older surgical patients 
are at the highest risk for prolonged catheterization; 23% of surgical patients older than 65 
years are discharged to skilled nursing facilities with an indwelling catheter in place and 
have substantially more rehospitalization or deaths within 30 days.70 Therefore, specific 
protocols for the management of postoperative urinary catheters are important for reducing 
urinary catheterization utilization and patient outcomes; the Surgical Care Improvement 
Project has added the removal of urinary catheters as one of their measures.
In a large prospective trial of patients undergoing orthopedic procedures, patients were 
entered into the following protocol: (1) limiting catheterization to surgeries of more than 
5 hours or for total hip and knee replacements and (2) the removal of urinary catheters 
on postoperative day 1 after total knee arthroplasty and postoperative day 2 after total hip 
arthroplasty. This intervention resulted in a two-thirds reduction in the incidence of UTIs.71
Alternatives to Indwelling Urinary Catheters
A randomized trial demonstrated a decrease in bacteriuria, symptomatic UTI, or death in 
patients who used condom catheters when compared with those with indwelling catheters; 
this benefit was seen primarily in men without dementia.72 Condom catheters have also been 
reported to be less painful than indwelling catheters in some men.72,73 Therefore, condom 
catheters may be considered in place of indwelling catheters in appropriately selected male 
patients without urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction.
Patients with neurogenic bladder and long-term urinary catheters, in particular, may benefit 
from intermittent catheterization.50 Intermittent catheterization may also be beneficial for 
short-term urinary retention. A recent meta-analysis reported a reduced risk of bacteriuria 
with the use of intermittent catheterization in patients following hip or knee surgery 
compared with indwelling catheterization.74 Combining the use of a portable bladder 
ultrasound scanner with intermittent catheterization may reduce the need for indwelling 
catheterization.45,75
Aseptic Techniques for Insertion and Maintenance of Urinary Catheters
When indwelling catheterization is necessary, aseptic catheter insertion and maintenance 
is recommended for preventing CAUTIs. Urinary catheters should be inserted by a trained 
health care professional using a sterile technique.50 Cleaning the meatus before catheter 
insertion is recommended; but ongoing daily meatal cleaning with an antiseptic has not Chenoweth et al. Page 7
Infect Dis Clin North Am . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 October 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
shown benefit and may increase rates of bacteriuria compared with routine care with soap 
and water.50 Sterile lubricant jelly should be used for insertion, but antiseptic lubricants are 
not necessary.50
Maintaining a closed urinary catheter collection system is important to reduce the risk of 
CAUTIs. Opening the closed system should be avoided, especially when sampling urine 
that may be performed aseptically from a port or from the drainage bag.50 Prophylactic 
instillation of antiseptic agents or irrigation of the bladder with antimicrobial or antiseptic 
agents has shown no benefit in preventing bacteriuria and is not recommended.50 Finally, 
routine exchange of urinary catheters is not recommended except for mechanical reasons 
because bacteriuria and biofilms return quickly.2
Use of Antiinfective Catheters
Antiseptic or antimicrobial impregnated urinary catheters have been studied extensively as 
an adjunctive measure for preventing CAUTIs with variable results.76,77 However, almost all 
previous studies used bacteriuria as the primary end point rather than symptomatic UTIs, 
thus limiting their clinical relevance. In a Cochrane review, silver alloy catheters were 
found to significantly reduce the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adult patients 
catheterized less than 7 days, but the effect was diminished in those catheterized for greater 
than 7 days.77 A recent multicenter randomized controlled trial that did use symptomatic 
CAUTIs as the end point reported no significant clinical benefit with the use of silver alloy-
coated or nitrofural-impregnated catheters during short-term (<14 days) catheterization.78 
Few studies have evaluated antiseptic and antimicrobial catheters in long-term urinary 
catheterization.79 Therefore, there is no recommendation for routine use of antiinfective 
urinary catheters to prevent CAUTIs.50 Despite these recommendations, a national study 
in 2009 revealed that 45% of nonfederal and 22% of Department of Veterans Affairs 
hospitals used antimicrobial catheters; hospitals using antiinfective catheters often based 
their decisions on hospital-specific pilot studies.12
IMPLEMENTATION: THE ROLE OF BUNDLES, COLLABORATIVES, AND 
LEADERSHIP
Recently, bundles of interventions have been used with success for the prevention of 
HAIs, including CAUTIs. The Bladder Bundle outlined using the mnemonic ABCDE  in 
Box 3 applied was successfully adopted by the Michigan Hospital Association Keystone 
initiative.49,53 After the implementation of this initiative, Michigan hospitals used more 
key prevention practices and had a lower rate of CAUTIs when compared with hospitals 
in the rest of the country.80 Finally, the important role of local hospital leadership and 
followership for ensuring effective implementation of preventive initiatives has recently been 
highlighted.81–83 The Web site www.catheterout.org  provides a list of common barriers 
along with solutions that hospitals may wish to use in their CAUTI prevention programs.Chenoweth et al. Page 8

SUMMARY
CAUTIs are common, costly, and cause significant patient morbidity. CAUTIs are associated 
with hospital pathogens with a high propensity toward antimicrobial resistance. The 
treatment of asymptomatic CAUTIs accounts for excess antimicrobial use in hospitals and 
should be avoided. The duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk factor 
for CAUTI; preventive measures directed at limiting the placement and early removal 
of urinary catheters have a significant impact on decreasing CAUTIs. Bladder bundles, 
collaboratives, and the support of hospital leaders are powerful tools for implementing 
appropriate preventive measures against CAUTI.

The ABCDE for preventing CAUTIs
• Adherence to general infection control principles (eg, hand hygiene, 
surveillance and feedback, aseptic insertion, proper maintenance, education) 
is important.
• Bladder ultrasound may avoid indwelling catheterization.
• Condom catheters or other alternatives to an indwelling catheter, such as 
intermittent catheterization, should be considered in appropriate patients.
• Do not use the indwelling catheter unless you must.
• Early removal of the catheter using a reminder or nurse-initiated removal 
protocol seems to be warranted.

KEY POINTS
• Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is often caused by 
hospital-based pathogens with a propensity toward antimicrobial resistance.
• The diagnosis of CAUTI is problematic because pyuria and bacteriuria 
are not reliable markers of infection. The treatment of bacteriuria in the 
absence of symptoms is not indicated, except in patients at risk of developing 
pyelonephritis or bloodstream infection (ie, pregnancy, urologic procedures 
with bleeding).
• Indwelling urinary catheters that have been in place for more than 2 weeks 
should be removed when treating CAUTI.
• The duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk for CAUTI; 
preventive measures directed at limiting the placement and early removal of 
urinary catheters significantly reduce CAUTI rates.
• Bladder bundles, collaboratives, and certain behaviors of hospital-based 
leaders are powerful tools for implementing preventive measures for CAUTI.Chenoweth et al. Page 17
