Comprehensive	Pediatric
Malnutrition	Assessment	Guide
1.	FUNDAMENTAL	DEFINITIONS
Nutrition	Screening	vs	Assessment
Nutrition	Screening:
	
-	Process	for	identifying	individuals	who	may
be	malnourished	or	at	risk	for	malnutrition	-	Determines	whether
comprehensive	nutrition	assessment	is	needed	-	Should	be	conducted
within	24	hours	of	hospital	admission	-	Typically	performed	by	non-
nutrition	healthcare	staﬀ	-	Uses	validated,	quick,	simple	tools
Nutrition	Assessment:
	
-	Comprehensive	approach	to	identifying
nutrition-related	problems	-	Performed	by	Registered	Dietitian
Nutritionist	(RDN)	-	Components	include:	-	Medical,	nutrition,	and
medication	histories	-	Client	history	-	Nutrition-Focused	Physical
Examination	(NFPE)	-	Anthropometric	measurements	-	Biomedical
data	and	medical	diagnostic	tests
Nutrition-Focused	Physical	Examination	(NFPE)	includes:
	
-
Muscle,	fat,	and	ﬂuid	assessment	-	Micronutrient	deﬁciency	review	-
Functional	status	assessment
Malnutrition	Deﬁnition
Pediatric	Malnutrition	(Undernutrition):
	
An	imbalance	between
nutrient	requirement	and	intake,	resulting	in	cumulative	deﬁcits	of
energy,	protein,	or	micronutrients	that	may	negatively	aﬀect	growth,
development,	and	other	relevant	outcomes.
Etiology	Categories:
	
1.	Illness-related:	One	or	more	diseases/injuries
directly	result	in	nutrient	imbalance	2.	Environmental/behavioral:
Factors	associated	with	decreased	nutrient	intake/delivery
Age	Range:
	
Children	aged	1	month	to	18	years	(separate	criteria
exist	for	preterm/neonates)

-	Mild	malnutrition:	<75%	of
expected	-	Moderate	malnutrition:	<50%	of	expected	-	Severe
malnutrition:	<25%	of	expected
6.	Weight	Loss	(2-20	years)

estimated	needs	-	Document	duration	of	inadequate	intake	-	Identify
barriers	to	adequate	intake
Growth	Indicators	Requiring	Second	Supporting	Indicator
9.	Linear	Growth	Velocity
	
-	Always	requires	second	indicator	due	to
measurement	challenges	-	Weight	gain	falters	before	linear	growth
falters
10.	Decline	in	Length/Height-for-Age	Z-Score
	
-	Should	be	used
with	other	supporting	indicators
5.	PRETERM	AND	NEONATAL
MALNUTRITION	INDICATORS
Population	Deﬁnition
Preterm	infants:	<37	weeks	gestational	age
Neonates:	Term	infants	<30	days	old
Weight	Status	Assessment	Methods
Method	1:	Days	to	Regain	Birth	Weight
Mild	Malnutrition	Criteria:
	
-	Failure	to	regain	birth	weight	by	Day
of	Life	(DOL)	15	-	PLUS	nutrient	intake	<75%	of	estimated	need	for
energy	or	protein	for	≥3	days
Rationale:
	
-	Most	neonates	regain	birth	weight	by	DOL	14	-	Requires
second	indicator	due	to	variability	-	Method	of	delivery	aﬀects	timing:
-	14%	of	vaginal	births	fail	to	regain	by	DOL	14	-	24%	of	cesarean
births	fail	to	regain	by	DOL	14
Clinical	Signiﬁcance:
	
-	Each	additional	day	to	regain	birth	weight
predicts	slower	growth	velocity	-	Consistently	strongest	predictor	of
neonatal	growth	velocity	-	Impact	on	outcomes	appears	ongoing
Special	Considerations:
Small	for	Gestational	Age	(SGA)	Infants:
	
-	Expected	to	have	recovery
growth	-	Should	use	“days	to	regain	birth	weight”	indicator	WITH
another	indicator	-	May	grow	faster	than	AGA	infants	initially	-	93%	no
longer	SGA	by	1	year	with	appropriate	recovery	growth
Large	for	Gestational	Age	(LGA)	Infants:
	
-	Expected	“catch-down”
growth	in	ﬁrst	3-6	months	-	Days	to	regain	birth	weight	may	NOT	be
appropriate	indicator	-	May	take	prolonged	time	to	regain	birth
weight	-	Clinical	judgment	required
Method	2:	Weight	Gain	Velocity
Purpose:
	
Short-term	assessment	after	birth	weight	regained
Calculation	Period:
	
-	1-2	weeks	recommended	-	Minimum	5-7	days
for	stability	-	Short	periods	more	responsive	but	less	precise
Weight	Gain	Goals	-	Determination:
	
-	Use	PediTools
(https://peditools.org/)	OR	-	Fenton	50th	percentile	tables	-	NOT	the
commonly	cited	15-20	g/kg/day	for	<2000g	or	25-35	g/day	for	>2000g
(these	underestimate	needs)
PediTools	Example:
	
-	Male	infant	at	32	3/7	weeks	-	Current	weight:
1550	g	(19th	percentile,	z-score	-0.88)	-	50th	percentile	weight:	1886
g	-	Weekly	weight	gain	goal:	214	g	to	maintain	current	percentile
Severity	Classiﬁcation:
	
-	Mild	malnutrition:	<75%	of	goal	for	1-2
weeks	-	Moderate	malnutrition:	<50%	of	goal	for	1-2	weeks	-	Severe
malnutrition:	<25%	of	goal	for	1-2	weeks
Note:
	
Goals	maintain	current	trajectory;	additional	nutrition	may	be
needed	for	recovery	from	malnutrition
Method	3:	Decline	in	Weight-for-Age	Z-Score
Purpose:
	
Long-term	indicator	(>2	weeks)
When	to	Use:
	
NOT	within	ﬁrst	2	weeks	of	life	(due	to	postnatal
diuresis)
Reference	Point	Options:
	
-	Birth	weight	(recommended	for	AGA	and
SGA	to	maintain	birth	percentile)	-	Admission	weight	-	Highest
achieved	weight	-	Clinical	judgment	determines	best	choice
Clinical	Consideration:
	
-	Growth	trajectory	for	most	infants	is	0.80
SD	below	birth	z-score	after	postnatal	diuresis	-	Providers	determine
best	growth	goal/trajectory	for	each	infant
Severity	Classiﬁcation:
	
-	Mild	malnutrition:	Decline	>0.8	SD	-
Moderate	malnutrition:	Decline	>1.2	SD	-	Severe	malnutrition:
Decline	>2.21	SD
LGA	Special	Consideration:
	
-	Decline	in	weight-for-age	z-score	>0.8
SD	may	be	appropriate/expected	-	Maintenance	of	current	percentile
may	not	be	appropriate	goal	-	Downward	trend	should	be	considered
when	evaluating	malnutrition	criteria
Nutrient	Intake	Assessment	for	Preterm/Neonatal
Energy	and	Protein	Goals
Parenteral	Nutrition	(PN):
	
-	Energy:	85-111	kcal/kg	(midpoint:	98
kcal/kg)	-	Protein:	3-4	g/kg
Enteral	Nutrition	(EN):
	
-	Energy:	110-130	kcal/kg	(midpoint:	120
kcal/kg)	-	Protein:	3.5-4.5	g/kg
Transition	Period	Calculation
Method:
	
Calculate	percentage	from	PN	and	EN	separately,	then	sum
Example:
	
-	28	weeks	PMA	infant:	65%	PN,	35%	EN	-	PN	energy	goal:
98	kcal/kg	×	0.65	=	64	kcal/kg	-	EN	energy	goal:	120	kcal/kg	×	0.35	=
42	kcal/kg	-	
Total	goal:	106	kcal/kg/day
For	Protein:
	
-	PN	protein:	3.5	g/kg	×	0.65	=	2.3	g/kg	-	EN	protein:
4.0	g/kg	×	0.35	=	1.4	g/kg	-	
Total	goal:	3.7	g/kg/day
Linear	Growth	Assessment
Indicators:
	
-	Decline	in	length-for-age	z-score	-	Linear	growth
velocity
Critical	Requirement:
	
Always	requires	second	indicator	due	to:	-
Diﬀiculty	obtaining	accurate	length	measurements	-	Measurements
using	tape	or	non-standard	boards	frequently	inaccurate	-	Weight	gain
falters	before	linear	growth	falters
Growth	Chart	Selection
For	Preterm	Infants:
	
-	Use	Olsen	OR	Fenton	(NOT	INTERGROWTH	-
insuﬀicient	sample	<35	weeks)	-	Continue	same	chart	until	corrected
to	term	-	Do	NOT	switch	charts	mid-assessment
Transition	to	Term:
	
-	Switch	to	WHO	at	term-corrected	age	(≥37
weeks	PMA)	-	Use	WHO	with	corrected	age	plots
Important:
	
BMI	on	Olsen	chart	is	NOT	recommended	for
malnutrition	diagnosis
6.	MALNUTRITION	ASSESSMENT	TOOLS
Pediatric	Subjective	Global	Nutrition	Assessment
(pSGNA)
Purpose:
	
Valid	nutrition	assessment	tool	for	diagnosing	malnutrition
in	hospitalized	children
Components:
1.	
Medical/Diet	History
Food	intake	evaluation
GI	symptoms
Functional	capacity
Metabolic	stress
2.	
Physical	Examination
Nutrition-focused	physical	exam
Muscle	wasting	assessment
Subcutaneous	fat	loss
Edema	evaluation
3.	
Weight	History	and	Patterns
Growth	trajectory
Recent	changes
Validation	Evidence:
	
-	Correlated	with	infection	rates	-	Correlated
with	length	of	hospital	stay	-	Correlated	with	readmission	rates	-
Sensitivity:	63.15%	-	Speciﬁcity:	70.45%	(higher	than	STAMP	at
18.18%)	-	Overall	accuracy:	67.07%
Comparison	to	STAMP:
	
-	STAMP:	High	sensitivity	(79%),	lower
speciﬁcity	(18%)	-	pSGNA:	Moderate	sensitivity	(63%),	higher
speciﬁcity	(70%)	-	STAMP	identiﬁes	more	at-risk	children	(may
include	false	positives)	-	pSGNA	more	accurately	diagnoses	actual
malnutrition	-	
Clinical	Use:
	
STAMP	for	screening	→	pSGNA	for
assessment	conﬁrmation
Key	Distinction:
	
-	More	robust	than	anthropometrics	alone	-	Includes
factors	beyond	measurements	-	Less	detailed	than	full	nutrition
assessment	-	Should	NOT	be	used	interchangeably	with	screening
tools
Clinical	Recommendation:
	
-	Use	STAMP	for	initial	screening	(wide
net,	avoid	false	negatives)	-	Follow	up	positive	screens	with	pSGNA	to
verify	actual	nutrition	status	-	Reduces	unnecessary	full	assessments
while	ensuring	malnourished	children	identiﬁed

9.	CLINICAL	OUTCOMES	AND	EVIDENCE
Malnutrition	Prevalence
Hospitalized	Children:
	
-	Coded	diagnosis	prevalence:	2.6-4.8%
(likely	underestimates	true	prevalence)	-	Actual	prevalence:	19-20%	at
admission	-	Hospital-acquired	malnutrition:	24%	develop	during
hospitalization
Age	Distribution:
	
-	Highest	rates:	Children	<1	year	(4.1%)	-
Moderate	rates:	Children	1-4	years	-	Lowest	rates:	Children	≥5	years
(1.6%)	-	Inverse	association	between	age	and	malnutrition
Setting	Variations:
	
-	Acute	care/inpatient:	56.7%	-	Outpatient:	33.3%
-	Day-hospital:	28.3%
Clinical	Outcomes	Associated	with	Malnutrition
Length	of	Stay:
	
-	Malnourished	children:	11.2	days	(median)	-	Well-
nourished	children:	6.4	days	(median)	-	Direct	correlation	with
malnutrition	severity
Hospital	Costs:
	
-	Malnourished	children:	$31,000	per	stay	(mean)	-
Well-nourished	children:	$16,746	per	stay	(mean)	-	Approximately
85%	increase	in	costs	-	Dutch	estimates:	€51	million	for	acute
malnutrition,	€46	million	for	chronic	malnutrition	annually
Infection	Rates:
	
-	Hospital-acquired	malnutrition:	24%	infection	rate
-	Without	malnutrition:	11%	infection	rate	-	More	than	double	the	risk
Mortality:
	
-	Malnourished	children:	8.7	per	1000	patients	-	Well-
nourished	children:	3.9	per	1000	patients	-	More	than	double	the	risk
Surgical	Outcomes	(Crohn’s	Disease	Study):
	
-	Increasing
malnutrition	severity	→	increasing	30-day	complications	-	Worsening
malnutrition	correlates	with:	-	Higher	rates	of	preoperative	PN	needs	-
Higher	rates	of	preoperative	sepsis	-	Higher	rates	of	preoperative
blood	transfusions	-	Longer	total	and	postoperative	LOS
Readmissions:
	
-	Higher	odds	of	7-day	readmission	in	malnourished
patients	-	Younger	malnourished	children	at	highest	risk	-	Varies	by
diagnosis	(oncology	and	heart	failure	highest)
Nutrition	Intervention	Impact
Hospital-Acquired	Malnutrition	Study	(623	children,	Thailand):
-	HAM	prevalence:	24%	-	
With	nutrition	management:
	
-	Signiﬁcant
reduction	in	HAM	incidence	-	Trend	toward	60%	decrease	in
infectious	complications	in	patients	with	moderate-severe	medical
conditions	-	Improved	nutrition	status	during	hospitalization	-	Lower
risk	of	hospital	morbidity
Conclusion:
	
Malnourished	patients	with	nutrition	intervention
experience	improvement	in	nutrition	status	and	lower	risk	of
complications
STRONGkids	Outcome	Study	(62,408	children,	China):
	
-	High
nutrition	risk	associated	with:	-	Longer	LOS	(P<0.001)	-	Higher
hospital	costs	(P<0.001)	-	More	medication	use	(P<0.001)	-	More
antibiotic	use	(P<0.001)
10.	SPECIAL	POPULATION
CONSIDERATIONS
Small	for	Gestational	Age	(SGA)	Infants
Deﬁnition:
	
Birth	weight	>2	standard	deviations	below	mean	(≈3rd
percentile)	for	gestational	age
Growth	Expectations:
	
-	Should	have	recovery	growth,	especially	in
ﬁrst	4	months	-	May	continue	until	6	years	of	age	-	93%	no	longer	SGA
by	1	year	with	appropriate	recovery	-	May	grow	faster	than	AGA
counterparts	initially
Malnutrition	Diagnosis:
	
-	In	ﬁrst	2	weeks:	Expected	to	have	weight
gain	velocity	ABOVE	norm	-	Should	use	“days	to	regain	birth	weight”
indicator	WITH	another	indicator	(e.g.,	inadequate	intake)	-	Do	NOT
diagnose	malnutrition	based	on	birth	anthropometrics	alone
Clinical	Implications:
	
-	SGA	without	subsequent	recovery	→	poor
long-term	developmental	outcomes	-	SGA	with	recovery	growth	→
outcomes	similar	to	AGA
Body	Composition	Changes	(0-4	months):
	
-	Lower	fat	mass	at
birth	vs	AGA/LGA	-	Increase	body	weight	and	length	at	signiﬁcantly
higher	rate	-	Increase	fat	mass	by	23×	(vs	2.8×	for	LGA)	-	May	be
related	to	feeding	methodology	diﬀerences
Large	for	Gestational	Age	(LGA)	Infants
Growth	Expectations:
	
-	Expected	“catch-down”	or	downward	growth
trajectory	-	Primarily	occurs	in	ﬁrst	3-6	months	-	Return	to	genetically
determined	growth	trajectory	after	escaping	maternal	inﬂuence	-
Slower	weight	gain	in	ﬁrst	6	months	resulting	in	similar	weight/length
to	AGA	by	6	months
Malnutrition	Diagnosis	Considerations:
	
-	Days	to	regain	birth
weight	may	NOT	be	appropriate	indicator	-	May	take	prolonged	time
to	regain	birth	weight	as	expected	pattern	-	Downward	trend	should
be	considered	when	evaluating	criteria	-	Decline	in	weight-for-age	z-
score	>0.8	SD	may	be	appropriate/expected	-	Maintenance	of	birth
percentile	may	not	be	appropriate	goal
Clinical	Judgment	Required:
	
-	Evaluate	adequacy	of	nutrient	intake
-	Consider	medical	conditions	(infant	of	diabetic	mother)	-	Assess
whether	steady	growth	present	-	Balance	expected	catch-down	vs
pathologic	growth	failure
Long-term	Considerations:
	
-	At	4	years:	LGA	preterm	infants	have
higher	BMI	than	AGA	preterm	and	full-term	-	Gained	weight	faster
than	linear	growth
Critical	Care	(PICU)	Population
High-Risk	Factors	for	Nutrition	Status	Deterioration:
	
-	Complex
chronic	conditions	(highest	risk)	-	Age	<2	years	-	Fluid	overload	at
admission	-	Low	serum	albumin	at	admission	(note:	marker	of
inﬂammation/outcomes,	not	nutrition	status)
Outcomes:
	
-	Prolonged	PICU	stay	associated	with	nutrition	status
deterioration	-	Need	for	early	identiﬁcation	and	intervention
Screening	Considerations:
	
-	May	require	diﬀerent	screening
approach	than	general	pediatrics	-	PICU-ScREEN	developed	and
tested	(363	children,	Brazil)	-	Identiﬁes	both	nutrition	status
deterioration	and	risk	for	prolonged	stay
Surgical	Population
Malnutrition	Impact	on	Surgical	Outcomes:
	
-	19%	of	pediatric
surgical	patients	meet	one	malnutrition	deﬁnition	-	Malnutrition
associated	with	postoperative	infection	risk	-	Severity	correlates	with
30-day	complications
Assessment	Challenges:
	
-	Many	studies	use	outdated	criteria
(albumin,	stunting	alone)	-	Need	for	prospective	studies	using
consensus	indicators
Clinical	Importance:
	
-	Preoperative	nutrition	optimization	may
improve	outcomes	-	Malnutrition	screening	should	be	routine	in
preoperative	assessment
Infants	and	Children	<2	Years
Challenges:
	
-	Highest	malnutrition	prevalence	(4.1%	coded,	likely
higher	actual)	-	Most	underrepresented	in	screening	tool	validation
studies	-	Constitute	73%	of	all	pediatric	hospital	stays	-	Account	for
57.9%	of	aggregate	pediatric	hospital	costs
Available	Tools:
	
-	iNEWS:	Validated	for	infants	<12	months	(high
sensitivity/speciﬁcity,	499	infants)	-	STAMP:	Some	validation	in
children	<24	months	(59	infants,	moderate	validity)	-	Most	other	tools
have	limited	data	in	this	age	group
Research	Priority:
	
-	Validation	of	existing	tools	in	larger	samples	of
children	<2	years	-	Development	of	age-speciﬁc	tools	if	needed
Oncology	Population
Malnutrition	Considerations:
	
-	High	prevalence	of	malnutrition	-
High	readmission	rates	(up	to	38%)	-	Specialized	screening	tools
available	(SCAN)	-	Automated	screening	eﬀective	(5,447	patients,
Australia)
Screening	Eﬀectiveness:
	
-	Automated	malnutrition	screen	using
anthropometric	EHR	data	-	Eﬀiciently	identiﬁes	patients	at	risk	during
admission	-	Allows	for	targeted	intervention
11.	EHR	INTEGRATION	AND	AUTOMATED
SCREENING
Beneﬁts	of	EHR-Compatible	Tools
Advantages:
	
-	Automatic	calculation	of	z-scores	-	Systematic
screening	of	all	admissions	-	Real-time	alerts	for	high-risk	patients	-
Reduced	time	burden	on	staﬀ	-	Improved	documentation	-	Better	data
capture	for	quality	monitoring
Validated	EHR-Modiﬁed	Tools
EHR-STAMP	(3,553	children,	Australia):
	
-	Modiﬁed	STAMP	for
EHR	compatibility	-	Includes	ASPEN/Academy	pediatric	indicators	-
Performance:
	
-	Sensitivity:	89%	-	Speciﬁcity:	97%	-	Negative
predictive	value:	94%	-	Highly	reliable	for	EHR	use
Automated	Screening	Using	ASPEN/Academy	Indicators	(5,447
patients,	Australia):
	
-	Uses	structured	anthropometric	data	in	EHR	-
Generates	daily	automated	email	for	positive	screens	-	Includes
computer-calculated	malnutrition	degree	-	
Outcome:
	
Children	with
screen-identiﬁed	severe	malnutrition	showed	improvement	after	3
months
EHR-Friendly	Screening	Tools
No	EHR	Modiﬁcation	Required:
	
-	STRONGkids:	Four	yes/no
questions	-	PNST:	Four	simple	questions	-	Both	easily	incorporated
into	admission	workﬂows
Require	EHR	Modiﬁcation:
	
-	STAMP:	Tool-speciﬁc	charts	-	PYMS:
BMI	scoring	guide	-	Solution:	Use	validated	EHR-modiﬁed	versions
Implementation	Considerations
Technical	Requirements:
	
-	Integration	with	anthropometric	data
ﬁelds	-	Automatic	z-score	calculation	capability	-	Alert/notiﬁcation
system	for	positive	screens	-	Documentation	template	for	results	-
Interface	with	RDN	workﬂow
Workﬂow	Integration:
	
-	Timing:	Within	24	hours	of	admission	-
Responsible	party:	Admitting	staﬀ	or	automated	system	-	Alert
routing:	To	RDN	for	positive	screens	-	Documentation:	Automatic
entry	into	chart
12.	KEY	CLINICAL	DECISION	POINTS
When	to	Use	Each	Screening	Tool
General	Pediatric	Inpatient	(1	month	-	18	years):
	
-	First	choice:
PNST	or	STRONGkids	(EHR-compatible)	-	Alternative:	EHR-STAMP
(requires	modiﬁed	version)	-	Consider:	Patient	population,	available
resources,	EHR	capabilities
Infants	(<12	months):
	
-	Preferred:	iNEWS	(speciﬁcally	validated	for
this	age)	-	Alternative:	General	pediatric	tools	with	caution	(limited
validation)
Preterm/Neonates:
	
-	Specialized	assessment	using	2018	indicators	-
FARNNeo	if	available	(validated	in	Brazil)	-	General	pediatric	tools	not
appropriate
Specialty	Populations:
	
-	PICU:	Consider	PICU-ScREEN	or	general
tools	-	Oncology:	SCAN	or	automated	screening	-	Cystic	ﬁbrosis:
Modiﬁed-STAMP	or	general	tools
When	to	Use	Each	Assessment	Method
pSGNA	vs	Full	Assessment:
	
-	Use	pSGNA:	When	screening	positive
and	need	to	conﬁrm	malnutrition	presence/severity	-	Use	full
assessment:	When	pSGNA	conﬁrms	malnutrition,	to	develop
comprehensive	care	plan	-	Don’t	confuse:	pSGNA	is	assessment	tool,
not	screening	tool
Single	vs	Multiple	Data	Points:
	
-	Single	point:	Use	z-score
indicators	(weight-for-height,	BMI-for-age,	length-for-age,	MUAC)	-
Multiple	points:	Add	velocity	indicators,	decline	indicators,	intake
assessment	-	More	data	points	→	more	conﬁdent	diagnosis
When	to	Use	Each	Preterm/Neonatal	Indicator
Days	to	Regain	Birth	Weight:
	
-	Best	for:	Early	identiﬁcation	(ﬁrst	2
weeks)	-	Always	requires:	Second	indicator	(inadequate	intake	most
common)	-	Consider:	Method	of	delivery,	SGA	vs	AGA	status	-	Do	NOT
use	alone	for	diagnosis
Weight	Gain	Velocity:
	
-	Best	for:	Short-term	assessment	after	birth
weight	regained	-	Time	frame:	1-2	weeks	(minimum	5-7	days)	-
Requires:	Appropriate	goals	(PediTools	or	Fenton	50th	percentile)	-
Consider:	SGA	(should	be	above	norm),	LGA	(may	be	below	norm)
Decline	in	Weight-for-Age	Z-Score:
	
-	Best	for:	Long-term
assessment	(>2	weeks)	-	Do	NOT	use:	In	ﬁrst	2	weeks	(postnatal
diuresis	confounds)	-	Reference:	Birth	weight	for	AGA/SGA,	may	use
other	reference	for	LGA	-	Consider:	Expected	trajectory	(most	0.80	SD
below	birth	z-score)
When	Linear	Growth	Requires	Second	Indicator
Always	require	second	indicator:
	
-	Linear	growth	velocity	-	Decline
in	length-for-age	z-score
Rationale:
	
-	Measurement	challenges	(accuracy	issues)	-	Weight
falters	before	length	-	Less	responsive	to	short-term	changes
Second	indicator	options:
	
-	Inadequate	nutrient	intake	-	Weight-
based	indicator	-	Days	to	regain	birth	weight

admission)	-	Is	consequential	(doubles	LOS,	costs,	infection	risk,
mortality)	-	Can	be	reliably	screened	using	validated	tools	-	Can	be
accurately	diagnosed	using	consensus	indicators	-	Responds	to
nutrition	intervention	-	Requires	systematic	approach	from	screening
through	discharge	-	Impacts	reimbursement	when	properly
documented	-	Can	be	prevented	with	early	identiﬁcation	and
intervention
Success	requires:
	
-	Validated	screening	tools	integrated	into
workﬂow	-	Trained	staﬀ	to	administer	screens	-	Adequate	RDN
resources	for	assessment	-	Standardized	diagnostic	criteria	-
