  "content": "Z-score extraction and interpretation: When extracting z-scores from format '[NUMBER] z [NUMBER]', the FIRST number is the percentile and the SECOND number is the z-score value. For percentiles below 50th, add a negative sign to the z-score value and interpret as below average for age; for percentiles above 50th, z-scores remain positive and indicate above average for age. Always cross-check against clinical context like 'short stature,' 'underweight,' or 'appears small for age' to validate interpretation.",
