  "content": "PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS:\n\nDEFINITION OF PSYCHOSIS:\n- Loss of contact with reality\n- Impaired reality testing\n\nCORE SYMPTOMS:\n\n1. HALLUCINATIONS:\n   - Perceptions without external stimulus\n   - Auditory (most common in schizophrenia): Voices, commands\n   - Visual (suggest organic cause: delirium, substance)\n   - Tactile, olfactory, gustatory\n\n2. DELUSIONS:\n   - Fixed false beliefs despite contrary evidence\n   - Persecutory, grandiose, referential, somatic, nihilistic\n   - Bizarre vs non-bizarre\n\n3. DISORGANIZED THINKING:\n   - Formal thought disorder\n   - Loose associations, tangentiality, word salad\n\n4. GROSSLY DISORGANIZED OR CATATONIC BEHAVIOR\n\n5. NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS:\n   - Affective flattening, alogia, avolition, anhedonia\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:\n\nPRIMARY PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS:\n\n1. SCHIZOPHRENIA (DSM-5):\n   - Duration ≥6 months\n   - ≥2 symptoms (≥1 must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech):\n     * Delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior, negative symptoms\n   - Significant functional impairment\n   - Not due to substance or medical condition\n   \n   Subtypes (historical, no longer in DSM-5):\n   - Paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, residual\n\n2. SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER:\n   - Schizophrenia criteria + major mood episode (depression or mania)\n   - Delusions/hallucinations ≥2 weeks WITHOUT mood symptoms\n   - Mood symptoms present for majority of illness\n\n3. BRIEF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER:\n   - Psychotic symptoms lasting 1 day to 1 month\n   - Full return to baseline\n   - Often follows stressor\n\n4. SCHIZOPHRENIFORM DISORDER:\n   - Schizophrenia symptoms lasting 1-6 months\n   - May or may not have functional impairment\n\n5. DELUSIONAL DISORDER:\n   - ≥1 non-bizarre delusion for ≥1 month\n   - Otherwise normal functioning\n   - No prominent hallucinations\n   - Types: Erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed\n\nSECONDARY PSYCHOSIS (Must rule out):\n\n1. SUBSTANCE-INDUCED:\n   - Intoxication: Stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines), cannabis, hallucinogens, PCP\n   - Withdrawal: Alcohol, benzodiazepines\n   - Medication: Corticosteroids, anticholinergics, dopamine agonists, stimulants\n\n2. MEDICAL CONDITIONS:\n   - Neurologic: Seizures, tumors, stroke, dementia, encephalitis, MS\n   - Metabolic: Thyroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency, porphyria\n   - Autoimmune: Lupus, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis\n   - Infectious: HIV, syphilis, Lyme disease\n   - Endocrine: Cushing's, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia\n\n3. MOOD DISORDERS WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES:\n   - Major depression with psychotic features (mood-congruent or incongruent)\n   - Bipolar disorder, manic episode with psychotic features\n\nWORKUP FOR FIRST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS:\n\nLaboratory:\n- CBC, CMP (electrolytes, glucose, renal, hepatic)\n- TSH, vitamin B12, folate\n- RPR/VDRL (syphilis)\n- HIV\n- Urine drug screen\n- Pregnancy test (if applicable)\n- Consider: Ceruloplasmin (Wilson's), ANA, ESR (autoimmune), ammonia\n\nImaging:\n- Brain MRI (preferred) or CT\n- Rule out structural lesions, demyelination, stroke\n\nAdditional:\n- EEG if concern for seizures\n- Lumbar puncture if infectious/inflammatory concern\n\nTREATMENT:\n\nACUTE MANAGEMENT:\n\n1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT:\n   - Risk to self (suicide): 5% lifetime risk in schizophrenia\n   - Risk to others (violence): Assess command hallucinations, paranoia\n   - Involuntary hospitalization if imminent danger\n\n2. ANTIPSYCHOTICS:\n   \n   Typical (First-generation):\n   - Haloperidol 5-10mg PO/IM (onset 30-60min)\n   - Mechanism: D2 receptor antagonism\n   - Side effects: EPS (dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism), tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia, NMS\n   \n   Atypical (Second-generation) - Preferred:\n   - Risperidone 2-6mg/day\n   - Olanzapine 10-20mg/day (IM available for agitation)\n   - Quetiapine 300-800mg/day\n   - Aripiprazole 10-30mg/day\n   - Ziprasidone, paliperidone, lurasidone\n   - Mechanism: D2 + 5-HT2A antagonism\n   - Side effects: Metabolic (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia), sedation, QTc prolongation\n   \n   Clozapine:\n   - Reserved for treatment-resistant (failed ≥2 trials)\n   - Most effective but requires monitoring (ANC, metabolic)\n   - Risk of agranulocytosis (1%)\n\n3. AGITATION:\n   - Verbal de-escalation first\n   - Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam 1-2mg PO/IM\n   - Antipsychotic + benzodiazepine combination\n   - Avoid excessive sedation\n\nCHRONIC MANAGEMENT:\n\n1. MAINTENANCE ANTIPSYCHOTICS:\n   - Continue indefinitely (high relapse risk if discontinued)\n   - Lowest effective dose\n   - Long-acting injectable (LAI) if adherence issues\n\n2. MONITORING:\n   - Metabolic: Weight, BMI, fasting glucose, lipids (baseline, 3mo, annually)\n   - Movement disorders: AIMS scale\n   - Prolactin if symptoms\n   - QTc if on QT-prolonging agent\n\n3. PSYCHOSOCIAL:\n   - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for psychosis\n   - Social skills training\n   - Supported employment/education\n   - Family psychoeducation\n   - Assertive community treatment (ACT) teams\n\n4. COMORBIDITIES:\n   - Substance use (very common, 50%)\n   - Depression (treat with antidepressant + antipsychotic)\n   - Anxiety\n\nPROGNOSIS:\n- Schizophrenia: Chronic, relapsing\n- Better prognosis: Later onset, female, acute onset, good premorbid function, mood symptoms\n- Worse prognosis: Early onset, male, insidious onset, negative symptoms, substance use\n- Suicide risk: 5% lifetime\n- Reduced life expectancy (10-20 years) due to CV disease, metabolic syndrome",
