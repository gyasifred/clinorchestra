  "content": "Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Indications:\n\nEmergent Indications (AEIOU mnemonic):\nA - Acidosis: Severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1) refractory to medical management\nE - Electrolytes: Life-threatening hyperkalemia (K+ >6.5 mEq/L with ECG changes) unresponsive to medical therapy\nI - Ingestions/Intoxications: Certain toxins (methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, salicylates)\nO - Fluid overload: Pulmonary edema unresponsive to diuretics\nU - Uremia: Uremic complications (pericarditis, encephalopathy, bleeding)\n\nAdditional Indications:\n1. AKI Stage 3 with:\n   - Oliguria/anuria not responding to fluid resuscitation\n   - Uremia (BUN >100 mg/dL with symptoms)\n   - Severe azotemia\n\n2. Electrolyte abnormalities:\n   - Severe hyperkalemia (K+ >6.5 mEq/L)\n   - Severe hyperphosphatemia\n   - Severe hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia\n\n3. Acid-base disorders:\n   - Severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1 or HCO3 <10 mEq/L)\n\n4. Volume overload:\n   - Pulmonary edema with hypoxemia\n   - Anasarca unresponsive to diuretics\n\n5. Uremic symptoms:\n   - Encephalopathy\n   - Pericarditis\n   - Bleeding diathesis\n   - Nausea/vomiting from uremia\n\nRRT Modalities:\n\n1. Intermittent Hemodialysis (IHD):\n   - Standard outpatient dialysis\n   - 3-4 hours per session\n   - Hemodynamically stable patients\n\n2. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT):\n   - Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)\n   - Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)\n   - Preferred for hemodynamically unstable ICU patients\n   - Better fluid/electrolyte control\n   - Slower, more gradual treatment\n\n3. Peritoneal Dialysis:\n   - Less common for acute AKI\n   - May be used in pediatrics or resource-limited settings\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- Early initiation vs. watchful waiting is debated\n- Most nephrologists initiate when emergent indications present\n- Consider patient trajectory and likelihood of recovery\n\nSource: KDIGO Guidelines; Nephrology clinical practice",
