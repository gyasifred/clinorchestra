  "content": "BEST PRACTICES FOR DOCUMENTING Z-SCORES IN MALNUTRITION ASSESSMENT:\n\nAlways Document:\n1. The actual z-score value (with sign)\n2. The corresponding percentile\n3. The measurement type (weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age, weight-for-height)\n4. Date of measurement\n5. Comparison to previous measurements (trend)\n\nCorrect Documentation Examples:\n\u2713 \"Weight 12.5 kg, weight-for-age z-score -1.88 (3rd percentile)\"\n\u2713 \"BMI 14.8 kg/m\u00b2, BMI-for-age z-score -2.1 (2nd percentile), indicating moderate acute malnutrition\"\n\u2713 \"Height 92 cm, height-for-age z-score -0.67 (25th percentile), within normal range\"\n\nIncorrect Documentation (DO NOT USE):\n\u2717 \"3rd percentile, z-score +1.88\" (wrong sign - should be negative)\n\u2717 \"Below average growth, z-score positive\" (contradiction)\n\u2717 \"Z-score -2, 97th percentile\" (inconsistent - -2 \u2248 2nd percentile, not 97th)\n\nTrend Documentation:\n- \"Weight z-score declined from -1.2 (6 months ago) to -2.1 (today), indicating progression of malnutrition\"\n- \"Height-for-age z-score improved from -2.5 to -1.8 over 3 months with nutritional intervention\"\n\nRemember: Negative z-scores = below average = lower percentiles",
