  "content": "AORTIC STENOSIS (AS):\n\nDEFINITION:\n- Narrowing of aortic valve orifice\n- Obstruction to LV outflow\n\nETIOLOGY:\n- Degenerative/calcific (most common, elderly)\n- Bicuspid aortic valve (younger patients)\n- Rheumatic (rare in developed countries)\n\nCLASSIC TRIAD (Late symptoms):\n1. Exertional dyspnea (HF)\n2. Angina (myocardial O2 supply-demand mismatch)\n3. Syncope (exertional, due to fixed CO)\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n- Crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur\n- Radiates to carotids\n- Diminished/delayed carotid upstrokes (pulsus parvus et tardus)\n- Paradoxical splitting S2 (if severe)\n- S4 gallop\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC CRITERIA:\n\nSeverity grading:\n\nMild AS:\n- Aortic jet velocity: 2.6-2.9 m/s\n- Mean gradient: <20 mmHg\n- Valve area: >1.5 cm²\n\nModerate AS:\n- Velocity: 3.0-3.9 m/s\n- Mean gradient: 20-39 mmHg\n- Valve area: 1.0-1.5 cm²\n\nSevere AS:\n- Velocity: ≥4.0 m/s\n- Mean gradient: ≥40 mmHg\n- Valve area: <1.0 cm² (or indexed area <0.6 cm²/m²)\n\nVery Severe AS:\n- Velocity: ≥5.0 m/s\n- Mean gradient: ≥60 mmHg\n- Valve area: <0.75 cm²\n\nAdditional assessment:\n- LV function (LVEF)\n- LV hypertrophy\n- Degree of calcification\n\nSTAGING (ACC/AHA 2020):\n\nStage A: At risk\n- Bicuspid AoV, sclerosis\n- Asymptomatic, normal hemodynamics\n\nStage B: Progressive\n- Mild-moderate AS\n- Asymptomatic\n\nStage C: Asymptomatic severe AS\n- C1: LVEF >50%\n- C2: LVEF <50%\n\nStage D: Symptomatic severe AS\n- D1: High gradient (≥40 mmHg)\n- D2: Low-flow/low-gradient with reduced LVEF\n- D3: Low-flow/low-gradient with normal LVEF (paradoxical)\n\nNATURAL HISTORY:\n- Asymptomatic severe AS: 2-5 years to symptoms\n- Once symptoms: Survival 2-3 years without intervention\n- Sudden cardiac death: 1% per year if asymptomatic, much higher if symptomatic\n\nINDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION:\n\n1. Symptomatic severe AS (Class I)\n2. Asymptomatic severe AS with:\n   - LVEF <50%\n   - Undergoing other cardiac surgery\n   - Very severe AS (velocity ≥5 m/s)\n   - Rapid progression (velocity increase ≥0.3 m/s/year)\n   - BNP >3× normal\n   - Abnormal exercise test\n\nTREATMENT OPTIONS:\n\n1. SURGICAL AVR (SAVR):\n   - Mechanical valve (requires lifelong anticoagulation)\n   - Bioprosthetic valve (no anticoagulation, but limited durability 10-20 years)\n   - Indications: Low surgical risk, younger age, other cardiac surgery needed\n\n2. TRANSCATHETER AVR (TAVR):\n   - Less invasive, transfemoral or transapical approach\n   - Now approved for all risk categories\n   - Preferred if high surgical risk, elderly >80\n   - Complications: Vascular injury, stroke, paravalvular leak, conduction abnormalities (may need PPM)\n\n3. BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY:\n   - Palliative only (high restenosis rate)\n   - Bridge to AVR or destination if not candidate\n\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT:\n- No medications slow AS progression\n- Treat hypertension cautiously (avoid aggressive BP lowering)\n- Avoid strenuous activity if symptomatic severe AS\n- Serial echo surveillance:\n  * Mild AS: Every 3-5 years\n  * Moderate AS: Every 1-2 years\n  * Severe asymptomatic: Every 6-12 months\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\n- Heart failure (most common)\n- Sudden cardiac death\n- Syncope\n- Gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde syndrome: AVMs + AS)\n- Endocarditis\n\nPROGNOSIS:\n- Excellent after AVR/TAVR (30-day mortality 1-3% for SAVR, 1-2% for TAVR)\n- Poor without intervention if symptomatic (50% mortality at 2 years)",
