  "content": "Heart Failure Classification: Acute vs Chronic, and Systolic vs Diastolic. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure presents with sudden onset dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema, elevated JVP, pulmonary rales. Key labs: elevated BNP/NT-proBNP (>400 pg/mL suggests HF). Imaging: chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, pleural effusions. Echocardiogram shows reduced ejection fraction (<40% for HFrEF) or preserved EF with diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF). Acute on chronic HF is exacerbation of existing chronic heart failure.",
