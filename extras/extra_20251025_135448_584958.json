  "content": "Z-score verification step: After extracting z-scores, validate that the sign matches the percentile (e.g., 3rd percentile with z-score documented as '2.05' should be interpreted as -2.05 = severely below average; 92nd percentile with '1.41' should be +1.41 = above average) and confirm alignment with clinical descriptions such as 'short stature,' 'underweight,' 'appears small for age' (indicating below average) or 'well-nourished,' 'tall for age,' 'overweight' (indicating above average). Flag any discrepancies where percentile ranking contradicts the z-score sign or conflicts with the clinical narrative for manual review.",
