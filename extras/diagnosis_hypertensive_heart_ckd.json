  "content": "HYPERTENSIVE HEART AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:\n\nDEFINITION:\n- Combination of hypertensive heart disease AND chronic kidney disease\n- ICD-10: I13.0 (with heart failure), I13.1 (without HF), I13.2 (with HF and CKD stage 5/ESRD)\n\nCOMPONENTS:\n\n1. HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE:\n   - Cardiac structural/functional changes due to chronic hypertension\n   - LV hypertrophy (most common finding)\n   - Diastolic dysfunction → HFpEF\n   - May progress to systolic dysfunction → HFrEF\n   - Coronary artery disease (accelerated atherosclerosis)\n\n2. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE:\n   - GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m² for ≥3 months\n   - OR kidney damage (albuminuria, structural abnormality) for ≥3 months\n   \n   CKD Stages:\n   - Stage 1: GFR ≥90 with kidney damage\n   - Stage 2: GFR 60-89 with kidney damage\n   - Stage 3a: GFR 45-59\n   - Stage 3b: GFR 30-44\n   - Stage 4: GFR 15-29\n   - Stage 5: GFR <15 or on dialysis\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR-RENAL INTERACTION:\n\nType 1 Cardiorenal Syndrome:\n- Acute cardiac dysfunction → acute kidney injury\n- Example: Acute HF → reduced renal perfusion → AKI\n\nType 2 Cardiorenal Syndrome:\n- Chronic cardiac dysfunction → progressive CKD\n- Example: Chronic HF → chronic renal hypoperfusion → CKD\n\nType 4 Cardiorenal Syndrome:\n- Primary CKD → cardiac disease\n- Mechanisms: Volume overload, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, uremic toxins\n\nType 5 Cardiorenal Syndrome:\n- Systemic disease affecting both (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)\n\nDIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION:\n\n1. CARDIAC:\n   - Echocardiogram: LV mass, LVEF, diastolic function, wall thickness\n   - ECG: LVH (Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell criteria)\n   - BNP/NT-proBNP (if HF symptoms)\n   - Coronary assessment if angina\n\n2. RENAL:\n   - Serum creatinine, calculate eGFR (CKD-EPI equation)\n   - Urinalysis: Protein, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)\n   - Electrolytes: K, bicarb, calcium, phosphate, PTH\n   - CBC: Anemia common in CKD\n   - Renal ultrasound: Size, echogenicity, obstruction\n\n3. BLOOD PRESSURE:\n   - Ambulatory BP monitoring (if suspected white coat or masked HTN)\n   - Home BP monitoring\n\nBLOOD PRESSURE TARGETS:\n\nGeneral CKD:\n- <130/80 mmHg (ACC/AHA 2017)\n- <140/90 mmHg (KDIGO 2021, more conservative)\n\nCKD with albuminuria:\n- <130/80 mmHg to reduce albuminuria and CV events\n\nDialysis:\n- Individualized, generally <140/90 pre-dialysis\n\nTREATMENT:\n\n1. BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL:\n   \n   First-line (CKD with albuminuria or diabetes):\n   - ACE inhibitor OR ARB (not both)\n   - Reduces proteinuria, slows CKD progression\n   - Monitor: Cr may increase up to 30% (acceptable), K\n   \n   Additional agents:\n   - Thiazide diuretic (if GFR >30) or loop diuretic (if GFR <30)\n   - Calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine)\n   - Beta-blocker (if HF, CAD, or post-MI)\n   \n   Avoid:\n   - NSAIDs (nephrotoxic, worsen BP control)\n   - Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists if K >5.0 or GFR <30 (unless carefully monitored)\n\n2. HEART FAILURE MANAGEMENT:\n   - GDMT for HFrEF: ACE-I/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, MRA, SGLT2i\n   - SGLT2 inhibitors: Benefit in both HF and CKD (reduce progression)\n   - Diuretics for volume management\n   - Adjust doses for renal function\n\n3. CKD MANAGEMENT:\n   - Slow progression: BP control, RAAS inhibition, SGLT2i\n   - Manage complications:\n     * Anemia: ESA if Hgb <10, iron supplementation\n     * Bone disease: Phosphate binders, vitamin D, manage PTH\n     * Acidosis: Sodium bicarbonate if bicarb <22\n     * Hyperkalemia: Dietary restriction, K-binders (patiromer, SZC)\n   - Diet: Protein restriction (0.8 g/kg/day), sodium <2g/day, potassium restriction if elevated\n   - Prepare for RRT if approaching stage 5\n\n4. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION:\n   - Statin therapy (moderate-high intensity)\n   - Antiplatelet if CAD (weigh bleeding risk)\n   - Lifestyle: Smoking cessation, weight loss, exercise\n\nMONITORING:\n- Serum Cr, eGFR, electrolytes: Every 3-6 months (more frequent if unstable)\n- Urine ACR: Annually\n- Echocardiogram: As clinically indicated\n- BP: Home monitoring\n\nPROGNOSIS:\n- CKD is major CV risk factor (equivalent to CAD)\n- Risk of CV death > risk of progression to ESRD in early CKD\n- Combined heart and kidney disease: Significantly worse prognosis\n- Tight BP control and RAAS inhibition reduce CV events and slow CKD progression",
