  "content": "Hypertensive Heart Disease with CKD (I13.0): Combined diagnosis of HTN-related cardiac dysfunction + chronic kidney disease. Hypertensive Heart Disease: LVH (ECG: increased voltage, echo: wall thickness >11mm women, >12mm men), diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation), may progress to HF (systolic or diastolic). Chronic Kidney Disease staging: Stage 1 (GFR ≥90 + kidney damage), Stage 2 (GFR 60-89), Stage 3a (45-59), Stage 3b (30-44), Stage 4 (15-29), Stage 5 (<15 or dialysis). Clinical: HTN history, kidney disease history, volume overload, dyspnea, peripheral edema, uremia. Labs: elevated Cr, decreased GFR, proteinuria, anemia of CKD. Echo: LVH, preserved or reduced EF. Treatment: BP control (ACE-I/ARB nephroprotective), diuretics for volume, manage CKD complications (anemia, bone disease, acidosis, hyperkalemia). Cardiac-renal syndrome interplay: HF worsens kidney function, CKD increases cardiac risk.",
