WEIGHT-FOR-HEIGHT or BMI-FOR-AGE:\n   Mild: z-score -1 to -1.9 (approximately 3rd-15th percentile)\n   Moderate: z-score -2 to -2.9 (approximately 0.5th-3rd percentile)\n   Severe: z-score \u2264 -3 (<0.5th percentile)\n\n2. LENGTH/HEIGHT-FOR-AGE (if chronically malnourished):\n   Mild: z-score -1 to -1.9\n   Moderate: z-score -2 to -2.9\n   Severe: z-score \u2264 -3\n\n3. WEIGHT LOSS (compared to baseline):\n   Mild: 5% weight loss\n   Moderate: 7.5% weight loss\n   Severe: 10% weight loss\n\n4. DECELERATION IN WEIGHT GAIN VELOCITY:\n   Mild: Decline of 1 z-score\n   Moderate: Decline of 2 z-scores\n   Severe: Decline of 3 z-scores\n\n5. INADEQUATE NUTRIENT INTAKE:\n   Mild: <75% estimated needs for >7 days\n   Moderate: <50% estimated needs for >7 days\n   Severe: <25% estimated needs for >7 days\n\nAdditional Indicators (support diagnosis):\n- Physical exam: muscle wasting, subcutaneous fat loss\n- Laboratory: low albumin, prealbumin\n- Functional: reduced activity, developmental delay\n\nIMPORTANT: Z-score below -2 is a PRIMARY indicator.
