## Design Philosophy

**Theme: "Looking at with Purpose"**

The ClinOrchestra brand combines two powerful metaphors:

1. **Orchestra** 🎼
   - Represents the coordinated, multi-stage extraction pipeline
   - Conductor's baton = System orchestration
   - Musical notes = Data points being extracted
   - Staff lines = Parallel data streams
   - Harmony = Components working together seamlessly

2. **Clinical Precision** 🏥
   - Medical cross = Healthcare domain
   - Structured approach = Clinical accuracy
   - Purpose-driven = Meaningful data extraction

3. **Color Palette**
   - **Primary Blue** (#1e3a8a → #3b82f6): Trust, reliability, clinical professionalism
   - **Accent Green** (#10b981 → #059669): Growth, success, data flowing correctly
   - **Neutral Grays**: Clean, modern, focused
