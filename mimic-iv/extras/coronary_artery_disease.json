  "content": "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries causing myocardial ischemia. Risk factors: HTN, DM, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history, age (M>45, F>55). Clinical: stable angina (exertional chest pain relieved by rest), unstable angina (rest pain, crescendo pattern), asymptomatic. Diagnosis: stress test (EKG, echo, nuclear), coronary angiography (gold standard shows % stenosis). ECG: ST depression, T-wave inversion during ischemia. Troponin: elevated in ACS, normal in stable angina. Treatment: medical therapy (antiplatelet, statin, BB, ACE-I, nitrates), revascularization (PCI, CABG) for severe disease. Complications: MI, HF, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death.",
