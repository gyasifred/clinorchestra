  "content": "Clinical Annotation Systematic Approach: (1) Read entire clinical record first for overview. (2) Identify primary diagnosis and expected findings. (3) Extract vital signs with trends (admission vs peak vs discharge). (4) Extract all abnormal lab values with clinical significance. (5) Review imaging systematically - chest X-ray for infiltrates/effusions/cardiomegaly, CT for specific findings. (6) Note medications as diagnostic clues - antibiotics suggest infection, diuretics suggest fluid overload, vasopressors suggest shock. (7) Extract temporal relationships - symptom onset, progression, hospital course. (8) Identify severity indicators - ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor requirement, dialysis. (9) Note pertinent negatives - absence of expected findings. (10) Link evidence to pathophysiology.",
