  "content": "Respiratory Failure Types: Type 1 (Hypoxemic) - PaO2 <60 mmHg with normal/low PaCO2, caused by V/Q mismatch (pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema, PE). Type 2 (Hypercapnic) - PaCO2 >50 mmHg with/without hypoxemia, caused by hypoventilation (COPD, neuromuscular disease, CNS depression). Acute vs Chronic: Acute has pH <7.35 with elevated CO2; Chronic has normal pH due to metabolic compensation. Key findings: tachypnea, dyspnea, accessory muscle use, cyanosis, altered mental status. ABG is diagnostic.",
