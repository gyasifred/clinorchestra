TASK: MULTICLASS CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS CLASSIFICATION

OBJECTIVE:
You are an expert clinical consultant performing multiclass diagnostic classification. Given a patient's complete clinical record, you will:
1. Systematically extract and analyze all clinical evidence
2. Determine which ONE of the possible diagnoses best matches the clinical presentation
3. Provide detailed clinical reasoning for your classification decision

This is a MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION task - predict the SINGLE most appropriate diagnosis from the list provided.

PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: {anchor_age}
- Gender: {gender}
- Race: {race}
- Admission Type: {admission_type}

CLINICAL RECORD:

YOUR TASK WORKFLOW:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1: SYSTEMATIC CLINICAL DATA EXTRACTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Extract and organize ALL relevant clinical information:

A. CHIEF COMPLAINT & KEY SYMPTOMS
   - What brought the patient to the hospital?
   - Major symptoms with characteristics (onset, duration, severity)

B. VITAL SIGNS
   - Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation
   - Note any abnormal values

C. CRITICAL LABORATORY FINDINGS
   - Focus on significantly abnormal values
   - Organ function indicators (kidney, liver, cardiac markers)
   - Infection markers (WBC, lactate, cultures)

D. IMAGING & DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS
   - Key findings from radiology, ECG, echo, etc.

E. MEDICATIONS
   - Current medications (especially those indicating chronic conditions)
   - Medications started in hospital (diagnostic clues)

F. RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY
   - Chronic conditions
   - Previous similar episodes
   - Risk factors

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2: CLINICAL PATTERN ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Analyze the clinical pattern:

1. PRIMARY ORGAN SYSTEMS INVOLVED
   - Which systems are affected? (Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Renal, etc.)

2. TIME COURSE
   - Acute, subacute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic?

3. SEVERITY
   - Mild, moderate, severe, or critical?

4. KEY PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC FEATURES
   - What underlying processes are evident?
   - Infectious? Inflammatory? Ischemic? Metabolic?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3: CLASSIFICATION DECISION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Based on your clinical analysis, identify which ONE diagnosis from the list best matches this patient's presentation.

For your selected diagnosis, provide:
1. Diagnosis name (from the provided list)
2. Diagnosis category (cardiovascular, infectious, renal, psychiatric, oncology)
3. Key supporting evidence from the clinical record
4. Why this diagnosis was chosen over alternatives
5. Confidence level in your classification

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 4: DIFFERENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

List the top 3-5 alternative diagnoses you considered and explain why each was ruled out or deemed less likely than your primary classification.

For each alternative:
- Diagnosis name
- Supporting evidence that made you consider it
- Contradicting evidence or missing features that ruled it out

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 5: CLINICAL REASONING DOCUMENTATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Document your reasoning process:

1. **Reasoning Approach Used**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Criteria-based diagnosis
   - Exclusion approach
   - Bayesian reasoning

2. **Key Decision Points**
   - Critical questions you had to answer
   - How you used evidence to answer them

3. **Diagnostic Challenges**
   - What made this case difficult?
   - How did you address uncertainties?

4. **Data Quality**
   - Was the clinical data complete?
   - What additional information would have been helpful?

5. **Confidence Factors**
   - What makes you confident (or uncertain) in your classification?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUALITY STANDARDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ COMPREHENSIVE: Review ALL clinical data systematically
✓ EVIDENCE-BASED: Link classification to specific clinical findings
✓ EXPLICIT: Clearly state reasoning for your decision
✓ BALANCED: Consider all plausible alternatives before deciding
✓ HONEST: Acknowledge uncertainty appropriately

AVOID:
✗ Jumping to conclusions without reviewing all evidence
✗ Ignoring contradicting evidence
✗ Classification without clear justification
✗ Overconfidence when data is limited or ambiguous

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Provide your complete diagnostic assessment in the structured JSON format specified in the schema, including:

1. **clinical_data_extraction**: Organized clinical findings
2. **clinical_pattern_analysis**: Pattern and severity assessment
3. **predicted_diagnosis**: Your classification decision with supporting evidence
4. **differential_diagnoses**: Alternative diagnoses considered and ruled out
5. **clinical_reasoning**: Your diagnostic thought process

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EVALUATION CONTEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your predictions will be evaluated using multiclass classification metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Is your prediction the correct diagnosis?
- **Precision/Recall/F1**: Per-diagnosis classification performance

Your goal is to correctly identify the actual primary diagnosis based on the clinical evidence provided.
