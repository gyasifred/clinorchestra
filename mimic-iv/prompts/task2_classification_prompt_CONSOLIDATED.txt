TASK: MULTICLASS CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS PREDICTION (CONSOLIDATED DIAGNOSES)

OBJECTIVE:
You are an expert clinical consultant performing multiclass diagnostic classification. Given a patient's complete clinical record (WITHOUT knowing the final diagnosis), you will:
1. Systematically extract and analyze all clinical evidence
2. Assign probability scores to ALL 13 possible primary diagnoses
3. Provide detailed clinical reasoning for your probability assignments
4. Identify the most likely diagnosis with supporting evidence

This is a MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION task - you must provide probability scores for ALL 13 diagnoses that sum to 1.0.

IMPORTANT: These diagnoses have been CONSOLIDATED - same clinical conditions with different ICD codes (ICD-9 vs ICD-10) are treated as single diagnoses.

- Age: {anchor_age}
- Gender: {gender}
- Race: {race}
- Admission Type: {admission_type}
- Admission Date: {admittime}

YOUR TASK WORKFLOW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 1: SYSTEMATIC CLINICAL DATA EXTRACTION

Extract and organize ALL relevant clinical information:

A. CHIEF COMPLAINT & KEY SYMPTOMS
   - What brought the patient to the hospital?
   - Major symptoms with characteristics (onset, duration, severity, character, radiation, alleviating/aggravating factors)

B. VITAL SIGNS
   - Blood pressure (hypertension/hypotension?)
   - Heart rate (tachycardia/bradycardia?)
   - Respiratory rate (tachypnea?)
   - Temperature (fever/hypothermia?)
   - Oxygen saturation (hypoxemia?)
   - Note trends and abnormalities

C. CRITICAL LABORATORY FINDINGS
   Focus on significantly abnormal values:
   - **Cardiac markers**: Troponin (MI), BNP (HF)
   - **Infection markers**: WBC (infection), lactate (sepsis), procalcitonin
   - **Renal function**: Creatinine, BUN, GFR (kidney injury)
   - **Metabolic**: Glucose, electrolytes
   - **Hematology**: Hemoglobin, platelets
   - **Coagulation**: INR, PT/PTT

D. IMAGING & DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS
   - **CXR**: Infiltrates (pneumonia), cardiomegaly (HF), effusions
   - **ECG**: ST changes (ischemia), Q waves (MI), arrhythmias (AFib), LVH
   - **CT/MRI**: Specific findings
   - **Echo**: EF, wall motion, valves

E. MEDICATIONS
   - Medications are diagnostic clues:
     * Antibiotics → infection suspected
     * Anticoagulants → thrombotic risk/AFib
     * Diuretics → fluid overload/HF
     * Vasopressors → shock
     * Chemotherapy agents → oncology encounter
     * Benzodiazepines → alcohol withdrawal
     * Antidepressants → depression

F. RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY
   - Chronic conditions (CAD, HF, CKD, COPD, DM, cancer, depression)
   - Previous similar episodes
   - Risk factors (HTN, DM, smoking, alcohol, family history)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2: CLINICAL PATTERN ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Analyze the clinical pattern:

1. **PRIMARY ORGAN SYSTEMS INVOLVED**
   - Cardiovascular? (chest pain, dyspnea, edema, troponin elevation)
   - Respiratory? (cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, infiltrates)
   - Renal? (oliguria, elevated Cr, fluid overload)
   - Infectious? (fever, elevated WBC, positive cultures)
   - Psychiatric? (mood symptoms, suicidal ideation, substance use)
   - Multi-system? (sepsis affects all systems)

2. **TIME COURSE**
   - Acute (<24-48h): MI, sepsis, AKI
   - Subacute (days-weeks): pneumonia, decompensated HF
   - Chronic exacerbation: CAD, depression, alcohol abuse

3. **SEVERITY ASSESSMENT**
   - Mild: stable vitals, minimal organ dysfunction
   - Moderate: some abnormalities, responds to treatment
   - Severe: ICU-level, multi-organ dysfunction
   - Critical: shock, respiratory failure, severe AKI

4. **KEY DISCRIMINATING FEATURES**
   - What findings STRONGLY suggest specific diagnoses?
     * Troponin elevation + ECG changes → MI
     * Fever + infiltrate + cough → Pneumonia
     * Elevated Cr + oliguria → AKI
     * Depressed mood + anhedonia → Depression
     * Irregularly irregular rhythm → AFib

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3: MULTICLASS PROBABILITY ASSIGNMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL**: For EACH of the 13 consolidated diagnoses, assign a probability (0.0 to 1.0):

For each diagnosis, document:
- **Supporting Evidence**: What findings support this diagnosis?
- **Contradicting Evidence**: What findings argue against it?
- **Probability Justification**: Why this specific probability?

**Probability Assignment Guidelines:**
- **0.40-1.00**: Strong evidence supporting this diagnosis (key findings present)
- **0.20-0.39**: Moderate evidence, plausible but less likely (some features present)
- **0.05-0.19**: Weak evidence, possible but unlikely (few features, mostly ruled out)
- **0.01-0.04**: Minimal evidence, very unlikely (can't completely exclude)
- **0.00**: No evidence, definitively ruled out (contradicting findings)

**IMPORTANT**:
- All 13 probabilities MUST sum to exactly 1.0
- Be thoughtful about probability distribution
- If highly certain of one diagnosis: e.g., 0.70-0.85 for that diagnosis
- If multiple possibilities: distribute accordingly (e.g., 0.35, 0.30, 0.20, 0.15 for top 4)
- Don't over-concentrate unless evidence is overwhelming

**SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS:**

**Chest Pain (#1):**
- Troponin elevated → MI more likely (consider #3 NSTEMI or #4 Subendocardial MI)
- Troponin normal → non-cardiac chest pain
- Consider age, risk factors, ECG changes

**Cardiac Ischemia (CAD #2, NSTEMI #3, Subendocardial MI #4):**
- Troponin elevation is KEY
- ECG: ST depression/T inversion (NSTEMI), ST elevation (STEMI - not in top 13)
- Risk factors: age, HTN, DM, smoking, family history
- CAD = chronic, NSTEMI/MI = acute event

**Atrial Fibrillation (#5):**
- ECG: irregularly irregular rhythm, absent P waves
- May be primary or secondary to other conditions
- Look for "atrial fibrillation" in notes

**Sepsis (#7):**
- Fever or hypothermia + infection source
- Elevated lactate >2, hypotension, organ dysfunction
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics started
- Positive blood cultures
- NOTE: Consolidates ICD-9 (0389) and ICD-10 (A419) codes

**Pneumonia (#8):**
- Fever + cough + dyspnea
- CXR infiltrate/consolidation
- Elevated WBC
- Antibiotics for respiratory infection

**UTI (#9):**
- Dysuria, frequency, urgency OR fever + CVA tenderness
- UA: WBC, bacteria, nitrites
- Urine culture positive
- Antibiotics for urinary infection

**AKI (#10):**
- Elevated Cr (>1.5x baseline or absolute increase)
- Oliguria
- Volume overload
- BUN elevation
- NOTE: Consolidates ICD-9 (5849) and ICD-10 (N179) codes

**Depression (#11):**
- Depressed mood, anhedonia
- May be primary admission or concurrent
- PHQ-9 score documented
- Suicidal ideation assessment

- History of alcohol use
- Withdrawal symptoms: tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, hallucinations
- CIWA score documented
- Benzodiazepines for withdrawal
- Elevated LFTs, macrocytic anemia
- NOTE: Consolidates ICD-9 (30500) and ICD-10 (F10129) codes

**Chemotherapy Encounter (#13):**
- THIS IS NOT A DISEASE - it's an encounter code
- Patient has underlying cancer (check PMH)
- Chemotherapy agents documented
- May have complications: neutropenia, nausea, etc.
- If this is the primary code, patient came FOR chemo
- NOTE: Consolidates ICD-9 (V5811) and ICD-10 (Z5111) codes

**Hypertensive Heart Disease + CKD (#6):**
- Evidence of both HTN-related cardiac disease AND CKD
- Echo: LVH
- Elevated Cr, proteinuria
