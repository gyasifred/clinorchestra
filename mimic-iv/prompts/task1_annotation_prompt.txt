TASK: CLINICAL EVIDENCE EXTRACTION FOR DIAGNOSIS ANNOTATION

OBJECTIVE:
You are a clinical documentation expert. Given a patient's primary diagnosis and their complete clinical record, you will identify and extract ALL clinical evidence that supports the given diagnosis. This task is designed to create high-quality training data for medical AI systems to learn diagnostic reasoning.

PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Patient ID: {subject_id}
- Admission ID: {hadm_id}
- Primary Diagnosis: {primary_diagnosis_name} (ICD Code: {icd_code})
- Age: {anchor_age}
- Gender: {gender}
- Race: {race}
- Admission Type: {admission_type}

CLINICAL RECORD:
{clinical_text}

YOUR TASK:
Extract and annotate ALL evidence from the clinical record that supports the primary diagnosis "{primary_diagnosis_name}". Your annotation should be comprehensive, precise, and clinically accurate.

ANNOTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. SYMPTOMS & CLINICAL PRESENTATION
   - Extract all symptoms, signs, and clinical presentations mentioned in the record
   - Include onset, duration, severity, and progression
   - Note both positive and pertinent negative findings
   - Quote exact text from the record

2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
   - Extract vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)
   - Document physical exam findings relevant to the diagnosis
   - Include objective measurements and clinical observations

3. LABORATORY RESULTS
   - Extract all relevant lab values with units
   - Note abnormal values and their relationship to the diagnosis
   - Include trends (improving, worsening, stable) if mentioned

4. IMAGING & DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
   - Extract findings from radiology reports, ECG, echocardiograms, etc.
   - Include specific measurements and abnormalities
   - Note the clinical significance of findings

5. MEDICATIONS & TREATMENTS
   - List medications prescribed, especially those specific to treating this diagnosis
   - Note treatment responses (improved, no change, worsened)
   - Include dosages and timing if relevant

6. MEDICAL HISTORY
   - Extract relevant past medical history
   - Note previous episodes or chronic conditions related to the diagnosis
   - Include family history if relevant

7. RISK FACTORS
   - Identify risk factors for this specific diagnosis
   - Include lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, etc.

8. CLINICAL REASONING & DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
   - Extract any clinical reasoning documented by providers
   - Note if differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out
   - Include any diagnostic criteria applied

9. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS
   - Document the timeline of symptom onset, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment
   - Note any causal relationships described

10. SEVERITY INDICATORS
    - Extract any severity scores or staging information
    - Note complications or co-morbidities
    - Document functional status and impact on daily living

EVIDENCE QUALITY LEVELS:
For each piece of evidence, assign a quality level:
- DEFINITIVE: Pathognomonic finding or gold-standard diagnostic test result
- STRONG: Highly specific finding or major diagnostic criterion
- MODERATE: Supportive finding consistent with diagnosis
- WEAK: Non-specific finding that could be present in multiple conditions
- CONTEXTUAL: Demographic or risk factor information

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use direct quotes from the clinical text whenever possible
- Include location in text (e.g., "from discharge summary section on admission")
- Link evidence to specific diagnostic criteria for this condition
- Explain WHY each piece of evidence supports the diagnosis
- If evidence is absent that you would expect to see, note this as well

CLINICAL ACCURACY:
- Be medically precise and use appropriate clinical terminology
- Do not infer information not present in the record
- If uncertain about clinical significance, note this
- Distinguish between documented findings and clinical interpretations

COMPLETENESS:
- Review the ENTIRE clinical record systematically
- Do not skip sections even if they seem less relevant
- Extract both subjective (patient-reported) and objective (measured) data
- Include both admission findings and hospital course

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your annotation in the structured JSON format specified in the schema. Include all evidence categories with appropriate detail, quotes, and clinical reasoning.

REMEMBER: This annotation will be used to train AI systems for clinical decision support. Accuracy, completeness, and clinical validity are paramount.
