  ASPEN Pediatric Malnutrition Diagnostic Criteria:

  Requires ≥2 of the following indicators:
  1. Insufficient energy intake
  2. Weight loss or deceleration
  3. Loss of muscle mass or subcutaneous fat
  4. Fluid accumulation (edema)

  Severity Classification by Z-Scores:
  - Mild: z-score -1.0 to -1.9
  - Moderate: z-score -2.0 to -2.9
  - Severe: z-score ≤-3.0

  IMPORTANT: Context-dependent assessment required for children with
  chronic conditions. Consider etiology and duration.

    * Requires immediate intervention
    * High mortality risk
    * <1st percentile

  - -3 ≤ z < -2 SD: MODERATE ACUTE MALNUTRITION (MAM)
    * Nutritional rehabilitation needed
    * 2nd-3rd percentile
    * Risk of progression to SAM

  - -2 ≤ z < -1 SD: MILD MALNUTRITION RISK
    * Close monitoring required
    * 3rd-15th percentile

  - -1 ≤ z ≤ +1 SD: NORMAL RANGE
    * 15th-85th percentile

  - z > +2 SD: OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY
    * >97th percentile

  Height-for-Age (Stunting):

  MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE) SCORING:

  Score Range (0-30 points):
  - 24-30: Normal cognition
  - 19-23: Mild cognitive impairment
  - 10-18: Moderate cognitive impairment
  - 0-9: Severe cognitive impairment

  IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Adjust for education level (add 1-2 points for <8 years education)
  - Not diagnostic alone - requires clinical correlation
  - Limited sensitivity for early/mild dementia
  - Cultural and language factors affect performance

  Domains Assessed:
  1. Orientation (10 points)
  2. Registration (3 points)
  3. Attention/Calculation (5 points)
  4. Recall (3 points)
  5. Language (8 points)
  6. Visual construction (1 point)

type: tip

content: |
  GROWTH VELOCITY CALCULATION:

  Formula: (final_measurement - initial_measurement) / time_period

  Expression Units:
  - Weight: g/day or kg/month
  - Height: cm/month or cm/year

  Clinical Interpretation:
  - Compare to expected velocity for age and sex
  - Deceleration (crossing percentiles downward) is concerning
  - May indicate malnutrition even if absolute values are normal

  CRITICAL: Requires serial measurements over appropriate intervals
  (minimum 1-3 months for reliable assessment)

  - growth

type: warning
enabled: true

content: |
  REFEEDING SYNDROME RISK FACTORS:

  High Risk Patients:
  - Prolonged fasting (>7-10 days)
  - Severe malnutrition (BMI <16 or >15% weight loss in 3-6 months)
  - Low baseline electrolytes (especially phosphate)

  Prevention Strategy:
  1. Start feeding slowly (50-70% of estimated needs)
  2. Gradual increase over 4-7 days
  3. Monitor electrolytes closely (phosphate, potassium, magnesium)
  4. Supplement thiamine before refeeding
  5. Careful fluid management

  Warning Signs:
  - Hypophosphatemia (<0.6 mmol/L)
  - Cardiac arrhythmias
  - Respiratory failure
  - Altered mental status
  - Edema

  - refeeding syndrome
