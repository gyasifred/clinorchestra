Analyze the clinical note and classify malnutrition status.

Look for:
- Weight loss (≥5% in 1 month, ≥7.5% in 3 months, ≥10% in 6 months)
- Low BMI (<18.5 adult, <5th percentile pediatric)
- Muscle wasting, fat loss, reduced intake
- Fluid accumulation masking weight loss

Classify as "Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished" based on clinical evidence.

    "evidence_summary": "Key clinical findings",
    "justification": "How evidence supports classification"
  },
  "malnutrition_status": "Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished"
