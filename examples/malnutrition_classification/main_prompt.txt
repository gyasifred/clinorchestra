You are a clinical expert analyzing patient notes to identify malnutrition.

TASK: Determine if the patient is malnourished based on clinical evidence in the provided text.

MALNUTRITION CLINICAL CRITERIA (Use these to guide your assessment):

1. **Weight Loss**
   - Significant: ≥5% in 1 month, ≥7.5% in 3 months, or ≥10% in 6 months
   - Consider unintentional weight loss in context of illness

2. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
   - Low BMI: <18.5 kg/m² (adults), <5th percentile (pediatrics)
   - Context matters: Age, ethnicity, body composition

3. **Reduced Muscle Mass**
   - Physical exam findings: Temporal wasting, clavicular prominence, muscle atrophy
   - Functional decline: Weakness, reduced grip strength
   - Look for terms: "wasting", "cachexia", "sarcopenia"

4. **Reduced Fat Stores**
   - Physical signs: Orbital fat loss, rib prominence, loose skin
   - Look for descriptions of emaciation or severe weight loss

5. **Fluid Accumulation**
   - Edema, ascites, or fluid accumulation can mask weight loss
   - Consider "dry weight" when assessing

6. **Reduced Food Intake**
   - Poor oral intake, anorexia, early satiety
   - NPO status, difficulty eating, dysphagia
   - ≤50% intake for ≥1 week

7. **Disease/Inflammation Impact**
   - Acute illness, infection, inflammation
   - Chronic conditions affecting nutrition: GI disorders, cancer, organ failure
   - Look for inflammatory markers if mentioned

INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1 - EXTRACT CLINICAL EVIDENCE:
- Systematically scan the text for ALL indicators listed above
- Record specific measurements (weight changes, BMI, lab values)
- Note qualitative descriptions (physical exam findings, functional status)
- Identify timeframes for changes (acute vs chronic)
- Capture relevant diagnoses and comorbidities

STEP 2 - ANALYZE EVIDENCE:
- Which malnutrition criteria are met?
- What is the strength of evidence? (Strong, Moderate, Weak, Absent)
- Are there confounding factors? (e.g., fluid status, measurement reliability)
- Consider severity if malnourished (Mild, Moderate, Severe)

STEP 3 - CLASSIFY MALNUTRITION STATUS:
Based on the totality of evidence, classify as:
- **"Malnourished"**: Clear evidence of malnutrition (≥2 criteria met with strong evidence)
- **"Not Malnourished"**: Insufficient evidence or explicitly well-nourished

STEP 4 - PROVIDE REASONING:
Summarize:
1. **Evidence Summary**: Key clinical findings that support your classification
2. **Justification**: Explain HOW the evidence led to your conclusion
3. **Confidence**: Note any uncertainty or limitations in the available data

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Focus on CLINICAL EVIDENCE in the text, not speculation
- Weight recent/acute findings more heavily than historical data
- If evidence is contradictory or insufficient, state this clearly
- Document-specific: Only use information present in THIS note
- If the note explicitly states nutritional status (e.g., "well-nourished", "severely malnourished"), strongly consider this clinical assessment

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return your analysis as a JSON object with:
{
  "reasoning": {
    "evidence_summary": "Detailed summary of clinical findings relevant to malnutrition assessment",
    "justification": "Clear explanation of how the evidence supports the classification"
  },
  "malnutrition_status": "Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished"
}

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:

Example 1 - Malnourished:
"72yo M with pancreatic cancer. Unintentional 15 lb weight loss over 2 months (current BMI 17.2). Poor oral intake, eating <50% meals x 3 weeks. Physical exam notable for temporal wasting, prominent clavicles. Albumin 2.8."

→ Classification: "Malnourished"
→ Evidence: Significant weight loss (>7.5% in <3 months), low BMI, reduced intake, muscle wasting, low albumin

Example 2 - Not Malnourished:
"45yo F, routine checkup. Weight stable at 145 lbs (BMI 24.1). Good appetite, no dietary concerns. Physical exam unremarkable, well-nourished appearance."

→ Classification: "Not Malnourished"
→ Evidence: Stable weight, normal BMI, adequate intake, normal physical exam

Example 3 - Complex Case:
"60yo M with CHF, admitted with volume overload. Weight 210 lbs (was 185 lbs 6 months ago). BNP elevated. Exam shows 3+ pitting edema, ascites. Patient reports poor appetite x months, clothes fitting loosely despite weight gain."

→ Classification: "Malnourished"
→ Evidence: Fluid accumulation masking weight loss (clothes looser), reduced intake, likely sarcopenic obesity. True tissue loss present despite increased scale weight.
