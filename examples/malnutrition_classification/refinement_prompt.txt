You are refining a malnutrition classification using clinical guidelines and evidence-based criteria.

CONTEXT:
You previously classified this patient's malnutrition status. Now you have access to relevant clinical guidelines, diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based standards to validate and refine your assessment.

TASK:
Review your initial classification against the provided guidelines and refine if necessary.

GUIDELINES PROVIDED:
{rag_context}

INITIAL EXTRACTION:
{extraction}

REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Validate Against Guidelines**:
   - Does your classification align with evidence-based criteria?
   - Are the malnutrition indicators correctly interpreted?
   - Did you miss any important clinical criteria mentioned in the guidelines?

2. **Check Diagnostic Accuracy**:
   - Review weight loss thresholds (ASPEN/AND criteria)
   - Verify BMI cutoffs for the patient population (adult vs pediatric)
   - Confirm muscle/fat assessment findings
   - Check inflammation/disease context

3. **Refine Evidence Summary**:
   - Add any missing clinical evidence
   - Clarify ambiguous findings using guideline definitions
   - Strengthen justification with guideline-based reasoning

4. **Adjust Classification If Needed**:
   - If guidelines suggest different interpretation, update classification
   - If evidence was misinterpreted, correct it
   - If classification was correct, affirm it with guideline support

5. **Enhance Reasoning**:
   - Reference specific guidelines/criteria that support your final classification
   - Explain any changes made from initial classification
   - Note guideline-based severity if applicable

REFINEMENT CRITERIA:
- **Upgrade to "Malnourished"** if:
  * Guidelines reveal you missed significant criteria
  * Evidence meets formal diagnostic thresholds
  * Clinical context (disease, inflammation) confirms malnutrition risk

- **Downgrade to "Not Malnourished"** if:
  * Initial classification was too liberal
  * Evidence doesn't meet guideline thresholds
  * Confounding factors (fluid status) explained apparent findings

- **Affirm Classification** if:
  * Initial assessment was accurate per guidelines
  * Evidence clearly supports the classification
  * No new information changes interpretation

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return refined assessment as JSON:
{
  "reasoning": {
    "evidence_summary": "Updated clinical findings with guideline-supported interpretation",
    "justification": "Clear explanation incorporating guideline criteria and any refinements made"
  },
  "malnutrition_status": "Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished"
}

IMPORTANT:
- Only change classification if guidelines provide strong evidence to do so
- If initial classification was correct, affirm it (don't change just to change)
- Focus on improving the QUALITY and ACCURACY of reasoning
- Reference specific guidelines when available
- Maintain consistency with the clinical note's documented findings
