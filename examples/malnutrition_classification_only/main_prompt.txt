PEDIATRIC MALNUTRITION CLINICAL ASSESSMENT - Comprehensive evaluation with evidence-based recommendations following ASPEN consensus criteria.

*** ASPEN CLINICAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK ***
Perform systematic malnutrition assessment following Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition consensus criteria. CRITICAL: Clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exercised throughout the diagnostic process.

**CLINICAL TEXT:**

*** ASSESSMENT TYPES ***

FIRST, determine the assessment type based on available data:
- **SINGLE-POINT**: Only one encounter or one set of measurements documented
- **SERIAL**: Multiple measurements from the same encounter/visit
- **LONGITUDINAL**: Multiple measurements across different encounters with dates

Your interpretation MUST match the assessment type:
- Single-point: Can only assess current status, cannot determine trends
- Serial/Longitudinal: Can assess trends, velocity, percentile trajectory

*** ASPEN RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC INDICATORS ***

**PRIMARY SINGLE-POINT INDICATORS** (require only one measurement):

1. Weight-for-height/length z-score:
   - Mild: -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: ≤-3.0

2. BMI-for-age z-score:
   - Mild: -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: ≤-3.0

3. Length/height-for-age z-score:
   - Severe only (≤-3.0) - indicates chronic malnutrition/stunting

4. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC):
   - Mild: ≥-1 to -1.9
   - Moderate: ≥-2 to -2.9
   - Severe: ≥-3.0

**TWO-POINT INDICATORS** (require multiple data points):

1. Weight gain velocity (<2 years):
   - Mild: <75% of norm
   - Moderate: <50% of norm
   - Severe: <25% of norm

2. Weight loss (2-20 years):
   - Mild: 5% usual body weight
   - Moderate: 7.5%
   - Severe: 10%

3. Deceleration in weight-for-length/height z-score:
   - Mild: 1 z-score decline
   - Moderate: 2 z-score decline
   - Severe: 3 z-score decline

4. Inadequate nutrient intake:
   - Mild: 51-75% estimated need
   - Moderate: 26-50% estimated need
   - Severe: ≤25% estimated need

*** Z-SCORE IDENTIFICATION WITH CLINICAL CONTEXT ***

**Z-Score Formats and Interpretation:**
- Standard formats: "z -2.5", "z-score: -1.9", "Z: -3.0", "2 SD below mean" → -2.0
- Percentile indicators: "ile"/"ille" suffix (e.g., "2 ile" = 2nd percentile ≈ z-score -2.0)
- Shorthand notation: "<low #> z <positive mag>" (convert positive magnitude to negative z-score)
- Range validation: -6.0 to +6.0 (negative indicates below average)

**CRITICAL:** Negative signs (-) in z-scores indicate measurements below average and are primary indicators of malnutrition. Exercise clinical judgment in interpreting borderline values within clinical context.

**Common Percentile to Z-Score Conversions:**
- 3rd percentile = z-score -1.88
- 5th percentile = z-score -1.64
- 10th percentile = z-score -1.28
- 25th percentile = z-score -0.67
- 50th percentile = z-score 0
- Percentile <50th MUST have NEGATIVE z-score

*** ASPEN PRETERM/NEONATAL CRITERIA ***

For preterm infants <37 weeks PMA and term infants <30 days old:

**PRIMARY INDICATORS:**

1. Weight-for-age z-score decline:
   - Mild: 0.8-1.2 SD
   - Moderate: >1.2-2.0 SD
   - Severe: >2.0 SD

2. Days to regain birthweight:
   - Mild: 15-18 days
   - Moderate: 19-21 days
   - Severe: >21 days

3. Weight gain velocity as percentage of expected for gestational age

4. Linear growth velocity assessment with clinical judgment for measurement accuracy

5. Nutrient intake adequacy assessment over consecutive days

*** CLINICAL JUDGMENT - ESSENTIAL ASPEN REQUIREMENT ***

Clinical judgment must be exercised throughout assessment, particularly when:

**COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL EVALUATION includes:**
- History taking: feeding patterns, medical history, social circumstances
- Physical examination: growth parameters, clinical signs, developmental assessment
- Laboratory evaluation: when indicated by clinical presentation
- Differential diagnosis: considering underlying conditions affecting nutrition

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SITUATIONS requiring expert assessment:**
- Borderline anthropometric measurements requiring clinical context
- Conflicting indicators needing clinical interpretation
- Complex medical conditions affecting growth and nutrition
- Assessment of feeding adequacy in context of developmental level
- Evaluation of underlying causes contributing to nutritional status

*** DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS CRITICAL EVALUATION WITH CLINICAL JUDGMENT ***

When malnutrition is documented in notes, apply clinical judgment to critically evaluate:

**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:**
- Low z-scores/percentiles meeting ASPEN thresholds (<-1.0 z-score)
- Physical signs: visible wasting, muscle loss, growth faltering, nutritional edema
- Functional indicators: poor feeding, inadequate intake, feeding difficulties
- Growth patterns: poor weight gain velocity, crossing percentiles downward
- Laboratory indicators: nutritional biomarkers when clinically indicated

**CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE:**
- Normal/high anthropometric measurements (BMI ≥25 suggests overweight)
- Good clinical appearance: "well appearing", "NAD", alert and active
- Adequate nutritional intake: "eating well", "good appetite", meeting estimated needs
- Medical context: high-risk conditions where malnutrition coding may be prophylactic

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SYNTHESIS:**
If documented diagnosis contradicts objective ASPEN evidence, prioritize comprehensive clinical assessment. Documented malnutrition may represent prophylactic coding, historical diagnoses, or risk-based documentation rather than current nutritional status.

*** FOOD/NUTRIENT INTAKE ASSESSMENT - ASPEN PRIMARY DETERMINANT ***

ASPEN: "Food and nutrient intake are the primary determinants of nutritional status." Apply clinical judgment to assess:
- Current intake adequacy for clinical situation and developmental needs
- Feeding behaviors and patterns in clinical context
- Barriers to adequate nutrition requiring intervention
- Estimated needs based on growth pattern and medical condition

*** GROWTH PARAMETERS - CLINICAL JUDGMENT APPLICATION ***

ASPEN: "Growth is the primary outcome measure of nutritional status in children." Clinical judgment required for:
- Interpreting growth velocity in clinical context
- Assessing growth patterns over time
- Evaluating appropriateness of growth for individual child
- Identifying growth faltering requiring intervention

*** COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM WITH CLINICAL JUDGMENT ***

1. **ANTHROPOMETRIC PRIORITY:** If z-scores <-1.0 present meeting ASPEN thresholds → diagnose based on lowest z-score with clinical context

2. **DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS EVALUATION:** Critically assess documented malnutrition against objective ASPEN evidence using clinical judgment

3. **CLINICAL SYNTHESIS:** When z-scores ≥-1.0 or absent → comprehensive clinical judgment assessment incorporating:
   - Growth patterns and velocity over time
   - Clinical signs and symptoms of malnutrition
   - Feeding adequacy and intake assessment
   - Physical examination findings
   - Laboratory indicators when available

4. **AUTOMATIC SEVERE INDICATORS:** Nutritional edema, visible severe wasting, MUAC ≤115mm regardless of other measurements

*** STEP-BY-STEP EXTRACTION PROCESS ***

**STEP 1: EXTRACT AND DOCUMENT TEMPORAL DATA**

For each measurement, document:
- Exact value with date (e.g., "Weight 12.5 kg on 1/15/25")
- Percentile and z-score (e.g., "5th percentile, z-score -1.64")
- For serial/longitudinal ONLY: Calculate trends (absolute change, %, velocity, percentile crossing)

Examples:
✓ Single-point: "Weight 11.2 kg (3rd percentile, z-score -1.88) on 3/15/25. Single measurement available - trend assessment not possible."
✓ Longitudinal: "Weight 12.5 kg (25th %ile, z-score -0.67) on 1/15, 11.8 kg (10th %ile, z-score -1.28) on 2/14, 11.2 kg (3rd %ile, z-score -1.88) on 3/15. Declined 1.3 kg (10.4%) over 59 days with percentile crossing from 25th→3rd, representing acute malnutrition."

**STEP 2: APPLY CRITERIA WITH SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION**

For EACH criterion assessed, document the SPECIFIC part satisfied:

**WHO Malnutrition Classification (Weight-for-Height or BMI-for-Age z-scores):**
- z < -3: Document as "Severe acute malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score < -3 (measured z-score: [value])"
- -3 ≤ z < -2: Document as "Moderate acute malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score -3 to -2 (measured z-score: [value])"
- -2 ≤ z < -1: Document as "Mild malnutrition risk per WHO criterion z-score -2 to -1 (measured z-score: [value])"
- -1 ≤ z ≤ +1: Document as "Normal nutritional status per WHO criterion z-score -1 to +1 (measured z-score: [value])"

**ASPEN Pediatric Malnutrition Criteria (requires 2+ indicators):**

Anthropometric Deficit:
- Mild: Document as "Mild malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -1 to -1.9 (BMI-for-age z-score: [value])"
- Moderate: Document as "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -2 to -2.9 (weight-for-height z-score: [value])"
- Severe: Document as "Severe malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score ≤ -3 (BMI-for-age z-score: [value])"

Growth Velocity Deceleration (for serial/longitudinal ONLY):
- Mild: Document as "Mild malnutrition per ASPEN velocity criterion decline of 1 z-score (z-score declined from [initial] to [final], decline of [difference])"
- Moderate: Document as "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN velocity criterion decline of 2 z-scores (z-score declined from [initial] to [final] over [timeframe])"
- Severe: Document as "Severe malnutrition per ASPEN velocity criterion decline of 3+ z-scores (z-score declined from [initial] to [final] over [timeframe])"

**For single-point assessments:** State "Growth velocity cannot be assessed - only single measurement available. Recommend serial measurements at [interval] to establish trend per ASPEN monitoring guidelines."

Inadequate Nutrient Intake:
- Document as "Inadequate intake per ASPEN criterion <50% estimated needs for ≥1 week (documented intake: [%] over [duration])" OR
- Document as "Intake appears adequate, does not meet ASPEN inadequate intake criterion"

Physical Examination:
- Muscle wasting: Document as "Muscle wasting present per ASPEN criterion (temporal wasting, prominent ribs noted on exam [date])"
- Fat loss: Document as "Fat loss present per ASPEN criterion (orbital fat loss, loose skin noted on exam [date])"
- If absent: Document as "No muscle wasting or fat loss on examination, does not meet ASPEN physical exam criteria"

**STEP 3: MAKE BINARY CLASSIFICATION DECISION**

Based on documented criteria:

**MALNOURISHED** if:
- 2+ ASPEN indicators present, OR
- WHO z-score indicates malnutrition (z < -2), OR
- Clinical evidence of malnutrition with documented criteria

**NOT MALNOURISHED** if:
- <2 ASPEN indicators present, AND
- WHO z-score normal or at-risk only (z ≥ -2), AND
- No clinical evidence meeting diagnostic criteria

**STEP 4: PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION REASONING**

Document:
1. **Assessment Type**: [Single-point / Serial / Longitudinal] - [brief justification]
2. **Criteria Satisfied**: List each ASPEN/WHO criterion met with specific values
3. **Criteria Not Met**: Note which standard criteria were assessed but not satisfied
4. **Missing Data**: Identify gaps and recommend specific assessments needed
5. **Final Classification**: Malnourished or Not Malnourished
6. **Severity** (if malnourished): Mild, Moderate, or Severe
7. **Confidence**: Note limitations based on assessment type and data availability

**ANONYMIZATION:** Use "the patient", "the child", "the [age]-year-old"

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- State assessment type FIRST before interpreting data
- DO NOT calculate trends for single-point assessments
- DO NOT say "based on ASPEN criteria" - specify WHICH criterion
- Document exact z-score/percentile values with the criterion
- For serial/longitudinal: Always calculate and document trends
- For ASPEN diagnosis: Count indicators explicitly (need 2+)
- Quote exact measurements with dates
- Recommend serial measurements if single-point limits assessment
- Make a clear binary decision: Malnourished or Not Malnourished
- All z-scores below 50th percentile must be negative

**OUTPUT:** Return your analysis as structured JSON following the provided schema, with comprehensive reasoning in the "reasoning" field and binary classification ("Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished") in the "status" field.
