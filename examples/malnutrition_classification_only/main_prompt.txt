PEDIATRIC MALNUTRITION CLINICAL ASSESSMENT - Comprehensive evaluation with evidence-based recommendations following ASPEN consensus criteria (v1.0.0)

*** ASPEN CLINICAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK ***
Perform systematic malnutrition assessment following Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition consensus criteria. CRITICAL: Clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exercised throughout the diagnostic process.

**CLINICAL TEXT:**

{json_schema}

### STEP 0: MANDATORY PRE-CHECKS (v1.0.0)

**BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ASSESSMENT, VERIFY:**

1. **BMI/WEIGHT EXCLUSION RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
   - If BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile (z-score ≥+1.04) → STOP → Classify as Not Malnourished
   - If BMI ≥25 kg/m² → STOP → Classify as Not Malnourished (overweight/obese)
   - If weight-for-height ≥85th percentile → STOP → Classify as Not Malnourished
   - **Overweight/obese children CANNOT have acute malnutrition by definition**
   - Note: Stunting (height-for-age) can coexist with overweight, but does NOT equal malnutrition diagnosis

2. **POSITIVE Z-SCORE STOP RULE:**
   - If ALL measured z-scores are POSITIVE (≥0) → STOP → Classify as Not Malnourished
   - Positive z-scores indicate above-average growth, incompatible with malnutrition
   - Exception: Historical documented malnutrition with recent recovery (document trajectory)

3. **DESCRIPTIVE TERM WARNING:**
   - Terms like "failure to thrive", "poor weight gain", "feeding difficulty" WITHOUT objective z-scores <-1.0 are INSUFFICIENT for diagnosis
   - Require actual anthropometric measurements meeting ASPEN thresholds
   - Document these terms but do NOT use as primary diagnostic criteria

4. **DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS SKEPTICISM:**
   - ICD codes for malnutrition (E43, E44, E45, E46) may represent:
     - Prophylactic coding for high-risk patients
     - Historical diagnosis no longer active
     - Risk-based documentation, not current status
   - MUST verify with objective anthropometric data
   - If documented malnutrition contradicts normal/high BMI → Prioritize objective measurements

5. **"WELL-APPEARING" CLINICAL GESTALT:**
   - If patient described as "well appearing", "well nourished", "NAD" (no acute distress) AND z-scores are borderline (-1.0 to -1.5) → Err toward Not Malnourished unless 2+ clear indicators present
   - Clinical appearance should align with severity of anthropometric deficits
   - Severe malnutrition (z-score ≤-3.0) should have clinical signs (visible wasting, muscle loss)

*** ASSESSMENT TYPES (v1.0.0 CLARIFIED) ***

FIRST, determine the assessment type based on available data:

**SINGLE-POINT:** Only one encounter OR one set of measurements documented
- Can assess: Current anthropometric status, single z-scores
- CANNOT assess: Trends, velocity, deceleration, weight loss percentage
- Limitations: No trajectory information, cannot determine if acute vs chronic

**SERIAL:** Multiple measurements from the same encounter/visit (e.g., admission weight + daily weights during hospitalization)
- Can assess: Short-term trends within hospitalization
- May assess: Acute changes over days, recovery patterns
- Limitations: Limited time frame, may not represent baseline

**LONGITUDINAL:** Multiple measurements across DIFFERENT encounters with DIFFERENT dates (clinic visits over weeks/months)
- Can assess: Growth velocity, percentile trajectory, z-score deceleration
- Gold standard: Allows comparison to baseline, assessment of chronicity
- Required for: ASPEN two-point indicators (velocity, deceleration)

**CRITICAL:** Match your interpretation to assessment type. DO NOT claim "declining growth velocity" or "percentile crossing" if you only have single-point data.

*** CONFLICT RESOLUTION HIERARCHY (v1.0.0) ***

When anthropometric measurements conflict, use this hierarchy:

1. **BMI-for-age (HIGHEST PRIORITY for acute nutritional status)**
   - Most sensitive for acute malnutrition (wasting)
   - If BMI z-score is normal/high, overrides other indicators suggesting malnutrition

2. **Weight-for-height z-score (SECONDARY for acute status)**
   - Alternative to BMI for acute malnutrition assessment
   - If weight-for-height is normal, likely not acutely malnourished

3. **Weight-for-age z-score (COMPOSITE - less specific)**
   - Influenced by both height and weight
   - Can be low due to short stature alone (not malnutrition)
   - Use with caution, verify with BMI or weight-for-height

4. **Height-for-age z-score (CHRONIC indicator only)**
   - Indicates stunting (chronic malnutrition or other causes)
   - Does NOT diagnose acute malnutrition
   - Stunting alone (isolated height deficit with normal BMI) = Not Malnourished by ASPEN

5. **Clinical appearance (CONTEXT, not primary criterion)**
   - Provides corroborating evidence
   - Should align with severity of anthropometric deficits
   - If conflicts with objective measurements, prioritize measurements

**EXAMPLE CONFLICTS:**
- BMI z-score +0.5, weight-for-age z-score -2.0 → Not Malnourished (normal BMI, short stature)
- BMI z-score -1.2, described as "well appearing" → Mild malnutrition if 2+ indicators (prioritize objective data)
- Height-for-age z-score -2.5, BMI z-score +0.2 → Not Malnourished (stunted but not wasted)

*** ASPEN RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC INDICATORS (v1.0.0 CLARIFIED) ***

**PRIMARY SINGLE-POINT INDICATORS** (require only one measurement):

1. **Weight-for-height/length z-score (ACUTE MALNUTRITION INDICATOR):**
   - Mild: -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: ≤-3.0
   - **Used for:** Children under 2 years or when BMI unavailable
   - **Reflects:** Current nutritional status (wasting)

2. **BMI-for-age z-score (PRIMARY ACUTE INDICATOR):**
   - Mild: -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: ≤-3.0
   - **Used for:** Children ≥2 years (preferred over weight-for-height)
   - **Reflects:** Current nutritional status (wasting)
   - **CRITICAL:** BMI ≥85th percentile (z ≥+1.04) EXCLUDES malnutrition

3. **Length/height-for-age z-score (CHRONIC INDICATOR ONLY):**
   - Severe only: ≤-3.0 (indicates chronic malnutrition/stunting)
   - **CANNOT diagnose acute malnutrition**
   - **Stunting alone without wasting = Not Malnourished per ASPEN**
   - Requires correlation with acute indicators (BMI or weight-for-height)

4. **Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC):**
   - Mild: z-score -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: z-score -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: z-score ≤-3.0
   - **CRITICAL:** MUAC <115mm (severe acute malnutrition) regardless of other measurements
   - **Reflects:** Muscle and fat stores

**TWO-POINT INDICATORS** (require LONGITUDINAL data with multiple dates):

1. **Weight gain velocity (<2 years) - REQUIRES LONGITUDINAL DATA:**
   - Mild: <75% of norm for age/sex
   - Moderate: <50% of norm
   - Severe: <25% of norm
   - **CANNOT assess with single-point data**

2. **Weight loss (2-20 years) - REQUIRES LONGITUDINAL DATA:**
   - Mild: 5% of usual body weight
   - Moderate: 7.5%
   - Severe: 10%
   - **Requires baseline weight from previous encounter**

3. **Deceleration in weight-for-length/height or BMI z-score - REQUIRES LONGITUDINAL DATA:**
   - Mild: 1 z-score decline from baseline
   - Moderate: 2 z-score decline
   - Severe: 3+ z-score decline
   - **Requires z-scores from ≥2 encounters with dates**

4. **Inadequate nutrient intake - REQUIRES DOCUMENTATION:**
   - Mild: 51-75% of estimated need for ≥1 week
   - Moderate: 26-50% of estimated need
   - Severe: ≤25% of estimated need
   - **Requires specific intake documentation or dietary assessment**

*** Z-SCORE IDENTIFICATION WITH CLINICAL CONTEXT (v1.0.0) ***

**Z-Score Formats and Interpretation:**
- Standard formats: "z -2.5", "z-score: -1.9", "Z: -3.0"
- SD notation: "2 SD below mean" → z-score -2.0, "3 SD below" → z-score -3.0
- Percentile indicators: "ile"/"ille" suffix (e.g., "2 ile" = 2nd percentile ≈ z-score -2.0)
- Shorthand notation: "<low #> z <positive mag>" (convert positive magnitude to negative z-score)
- Range validation: -6.0 to +6.0 (negative = below average, positive = above average)

**CRITICAL SIGN RULES:**
- **Negative z-scores** (<0) indicate measurements BELOW average → May indicate malnutrition
- **Positive z-scores** (>0) indicate measurements ABOVE average → Excludes malnutrition
- **Z-score 0** = exactly 50th percentile (average)
- **All percentiles <50th MUST have NEGATIVE z-scores**
- **All percentiles >50th MUST have POSITIVE z-scores**

**Common Percentile to Z-Score Conversions:**
- 3rd percentile = z-score -1.88
- 5th percentile = z-score -1.64
- 10th percentile = z-score -1.28
- 25th percentile = z-score -0.67
- 50th percentile = z-score 0
- 75th percentile = z-score +0.67
- 85th percentile = z-score +1.04 (OVERWEIGHT THRESHOLD)
- 95th percentile = z-score +1.64

**Z-SCORE INTERPRETATION ERRORS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ DO NOT interpret positive z-scores as malnutrition indicators
- ❌ DO NOT confuse weight-for-age with BMI/weight-for-height
- ❌ DO NOT diagnose malnutrition based on height-for-age alone
- ❌ DO NOT use "2 SD" ambiguously (specify: below = -2, above = +2)

*** ASPEN PRETERM/NEONATAL CRITERIA ***

For preterm infants <37 weeks PMA and term infants <30 days old:

**PRIMARY INDICATORS:**

1. **Weight-for-age z-score decline (LONGITUDINAL):**
   - Mild: 0.8-1.2 SD decline
   - Moderate: >1.2-2.0 SD decline
   - Severe: >2.0 SD decline

2. **Days to regain birthweight:**
   - Mild: 15-18 days
   - Moderate: 19-21 days
   - Severe: >21 days

3. **Weight gain velocity as percentage of expected for gestational age**

4. **Linear growth velocity assessment** (clinical judgment for measurement accuracy)

5. **Nutrient intake adequacy assessment** over consecutive days

*** ASPEN DIAGNOSIS REQUIRES ≥2 INDICATORS (v1.0.0 EMPHASIS) ***

**CRITICAL ASPEN RULE:** Malnutrition diagnosis requires AT LEAST 2 of the following:

1. Anthropometric indicator (z-score <-1.0)
2. Growth indicator (velocity, deceleration - LONGITUDINAL only)
3. Inadequate nutrient intake (documented <75% needs)
4. Physical exam findings (muscle wasting, fat loss, edema)

**EXAMPLES:**
- ✓ BMI z-score -2.1 + inadequate intake documented = MALNUTRITION (2 indicators)
- ✓ Weight-for-height z-score -1.8 + muscle wasting on exam = MALNUTRITION (2 indicators)
- ✗ BMI z-score -1.5 only (no other indicators) = NOT MALNOURISHED (1 indicator)
- ✗ Height-for-age z-score -2.2 only (stunting without wasting) = NOT MALNOURISHED (chronic indicator alone)
- ✓ BMI z-score -2.5 (single indicator if severe <-2.0, OR if moderate need 2nd indicator)

**SINGLE INDICATOR EXCEPTION:**
- Severe indicators (z-score ≤-3.0, MUAC <115mm, nutritional edema) may be sufficient for diagnosis if clinically evident severe malnutrition
- Moderate/mild malnutrition ALWAYS requires ≥2 indicators

*** CLINICAL JUDGMENT - ESSENTIAL ASPEN REQUIREMENT ***

Clinical judgment must be exercised throughout assessment, particularly when:

**COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL EVALUATION includes:**
- History taking: feeding patterns, medical history, social circumstances, symptom duration
- Physical examination: growth parameters, clinical signs, developmental assessment, muscle/fat stores
- Laboratory evaluation: when indicated by clinical presentation (albumin, prealbumin, micronutrients)
- Differential diagnosis: considering underlying conditions affecting nutrition

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SITUATIONS requiring expert assessment:**
- Borderline anthropometric measurements (-0.8 to -1.2) requiring clinical context
- Conflicting indicators needing hierarchy application (use BMI > weight-for-height > clinical appearance)
- Complex medical conditions affecting growth (congenital heart disease, genetic syndromes)
- Assessment of feeding adequacy in context of developmental level
- Evaluation of underlying causes contributing to nutritional status

*** DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS CRITICAL EVALUATION (v1.0.0) ***

When malnutrition is documented in notes or ICD codes, apply clinical judgment to critically evaluate:

**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:**
- Low z-scores/percentiles meeting ASPEN thresholds (≥1 indicator with z-score <-1.0)
- Physical signs: visible wasting, muscle loss, growth faltering, nutritional edema, temporal wasting, prominent ribs
- Functional indicators: poor feeding, inadequate intake <75% needs, feeding difficulties
- Growth patterns: poor weight gain velocity, crossing percentiles downward (LONGITUDINAL data)
- Laboratory indicators: low albumin, prealbumin (with caveats about non-nutritional causes)

**CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE (PRIORITIZE THESE - v1.0.0):**
- **Normal/high anthropometric measurements:** BMI ≥25 kg/m² or ≥85th percentile EXCLUDES malnutrition
- **Positive z-scores:** Any z-score >0 indicates above-average, incompatible with malnutrition
- **Good clinical appearance:** "well appearing", "well nourished", "NAD", alert and active, no visible wasting
- **Adequate nutritional intake:** "eating well", "good appetite", meeting ≥75% estimated needs
- **Medical context:** High-risk conditions where malnutrition coding may be prophylactic (e.g., "at risk for malnutrition" coded as malnutrition)
- **Isolated height deficit:** Height-for-age z-score <-2 with normal BMI = stunting, NOT acute malnutrition

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SYNTHESIS (v1.0.0):**
If documented diagnosis contradicts objective ASPEN evidence, prioritize:
1. Objective anthropometric measurements (BMI, weight-for-height)
2. Physical examination findings
3. Clinical appearance and functional status
4. Documented intake adequacy

**Documented malnutrition may represent:**
- Prophylactic coding for at-risk patients
- Historical diagnoses no longer active
- Risk-based documentation rather than current nutritional status
- Coding for reimbursement purposes
- Confusion between stunting (chronic) and wasting (acute malnutrition)

*** FOOD/NUTRIENT INTAKE ASSESSMENT - ASPEN PRIMARY DETERMINANT ***

ASPEN: "Food and nutrient intake are the primary determinants of nutritional status." Apply clinical judgment to assess:
- Current intake adequacy for clinical situation and developmental needs
- Feeding behaviors and patterns in clinical context
- Barriers to adequate nutrition requiring intervention
- Estimated needs based on growth pattern and medical condition
- Documentation of intake percentage (e.g., "taking 50% of feeds", "NPO x3 days")

**INTAKE AS INDICATOR:**
- <75% of estimated needs for ≥1 week = Mild inadequate intake (1 indicator)
- 26-50% of estimated needs = Moderate inadequate intake (1 indicator)
- ≤25% of estimated needs = Severe inadequate intake (1 indicator)
- Must document duration and percentage to count as ASPEN indicator

*** GROWTH PARAMETERS - CLINICAL JUDGMENT APPLICATION ***

ASPEN: "Growth is the primary outcome measure of nutritional status in children." Clinical judgment required for:
- Interpreting growth velocity in clinical context (requires LONGITUDINAL data)
- Assessing growth patterns over time (compare to previous visits)
- Evaluating appropriateness of growth for individual child (genetic potential, underlying conditions)
- Identifying growth faltering requiring intervention (percentile crossing, deceleration)

*** COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM (v1.0.0) ***

**STEP 0: APPLY MANDATORY EXCLUSIONS FIRST**
1. BMI ≥85th percentile or ≥25 kg/m² → STOP → Not Malnourished
2. All z-scores positive (≥0) → STOP → Not Malnourished
3. Well-appearing + borderline z-scores (-1.0 to -1.5) + <2 indicators → STOP → Not Malnourished

**STEP 1: ANTHROPOMETRIC PRIORITY**
- If z-scores <-1.0 present meeting ASPEN thresholds → Potential indicator
- Use hierarchy: BMI > weight-for-height > weight-for-age
- Height-for-age alone does NOT diagnose acute malnutrition

**STEP 2: COUNT ASPEN INDICATORS**
- Anthropometric deficit (z-score <-1.0): ☐
- Growth velocity/deceleration (LONGITUDINAL only): ☐
- Inadequate intake (documented <75% needs): ☐
- Physical exam findings (muscle wasting, fat loss, edema): ☐
- **Need ≥2 checked for malnutrition diagnosis** (or 1 if severe z-score ≤-3.0)

**STEP 3: RESOLVE CONFLICTS**
- Apply conflict resolution hierarchy (BMI > weight-for-height > clinical appearance)
- Prioritize objective measurements over descriptive terms
- If documented diagnosis contradicts measurements → Prioritize measurements

**STEP 4: AUTOMATIC SEVERE INDICATORS**
- Nutritional edema (kwashiorkor) → Severe malnutrition regardless of z-scores
- Visible severe wasting with z-score ≤-3.0 → Severe malnutrition
- MUAC ≤115mm → Severe malnutrition regardless of other measurements

**STEP 5: VERIFY CLINICAL ALIGNMENT**
- Does severity of z-score deficits match clinical description?
- Severe malnutrition (z ≤-3.0) should have visible wasting, muscle loss
- If mismatch (severe z-score but "well appearing") → Review data quality, consider measurement error

*** STEP-BY-STEP EXTRACTION PROCESS ***

**STEP 1: EXTRACT AND DOCUMENT TEMPORAL DATA**

For each measurement, document:
- Exact value with date (e.g., "Weight 12.5 kg on 1/15/25")
- Percentile and z-score (e.g., "5th percentile, z-score -1.64")
- Measurement type (weight-for-age, BMI-for-age, height-for-age)
- For serial/longitudinal ONLY: Calculate trends (absolute change, %, velocity, percentile crossing)

**Examples:**
✓ Single-point: "BMI-for-age 14.2 kg/m² (8th percentile, z-score -1.41) on 3/15/25. Single measurement available - trend assessment not possible. Recommend serial measurements at 1-month intervals to establish trajectory per ASPEN monitoring guidelines."

✓ Longitudinal: "BMI-for-age z-scores: +0.2 (58th percentile) on 1/15, -0.5 (31st percentile) on 2/14, -1.2 (11th percentile) on 3/15. Declined 1.4 z-scores over 59 days with percentile crossing from 58th→11th, meeting ASPEN criterion for moderate malnutrition (≥1 z-score decline)."

**STEP 2: APPLY CRITERIA WITH SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION**

For EACH criterion assessed, document the SPECIFIC part satisfied:

**WHO Malnutrition Classification (Weight-for-Height or BMI-for-Age z-scores):**
- z < -3: "Severe acute malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score < -3 (measured BMI z-score: [value])"
- -3 ≤ z < -2: "Moderate acute malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score -3 to -2 (measured z-score: [value])"
- -2 ≤ z < -1: "At risk for malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score -2 to -1 (measured z-score: [value])"
- -1 ≤ z ≤ +1: "Normal nutritional status per WHO criterion z-score -1 to +1 (measured z-score: [value])"
- z > +1: "Above normal per WHO criterion z-score > +1 (measured z-score: [value]) - excludes malnutrition"

**ASPEN Pediatric Malnutrition Criteria (requires ≥2 indicators, or 1 if severe):**

**Indicator 1: Anthropometric Deficit**
- Mild: "Meets ASPEN anthropometric criterion: mild deficit with z-score -1.0 to -1.9 (BMI-for-age z-score: [value]) ✓"
- Moderate: "Meets ASPEN anthropometric criterion: moderate deficit with z-score -2.0 to -2.9 (weight-for-height z-score: [value]) ✓"
- Severe: "Meets ASPEN anthropometric criterion: severe deficit with z-score ≤-3.0 (BMI-for-age z-score: [value]) ✓"
- Not met: "Does not meet ASPEN anthropometric criterion: z-score ≥-1.0 (BMI z-score: [value]) ✗"

**Indicator 2: Growth Velocity Deceleration (LONGITUDINAL data required)**
- Mild: "Meets ASPEN velocity criterion: mild deceleration with decline of ≥1 z-score (BMI z-score declined from [initial] to [final] over [timeframe], decline of [difference]) ✓"
- Moderate: "Meets ASPEN velocity criterion: moderate deceleration with decline of ≥2 z-scores (z-score declined [amount] over [timeframe]) ✓"
- Severe: "Meets ASPEN velocity criterion: severe deceleration with decline of ≥3 z-scores (z-score declined [amount] over [timeframe]) ✓"
- Not applicable: "Cannot assess ASPEN velocity criterion - only single measurement available. Recommend serial measurements at [interval]. ✗"

**Indicator 3: Inadequate Nutrient Intake**
- Mild: "Meets ASPEN intake criterion: mild inadequate intake at 51-75% of estimated needs for ≥1 week (documented intake: [%] over [duration]) ✓"
- Moderate: "Meets ASPEN intake criterion: moderate inadequate intake at 26-50% of estimated needs (documented intake: [%] over [duration]) ✓"
- Severe: "Meets ASPEN intake criterion: severe inadequate intake at ≤25% of estimated needs (documented intake: [%] over [duration]) ✓"
- Not met: "Does not meet ASPEN intake criterion - intake appears adequate at ≥75% of estimated needs ✗" OR "Cannot assess - no intake documentation available ✗"

**Indicator 4: Physical Examination Findings**
- Muscle wasting: "Meets ASPEN physical exam criterion: muscle wasting present (temporal wasting, prominent ribs, decreased muscle bulk noted on exam [date]) ✓"
- Fat loss: "Meets ASPEN physical exam criterion: fat loss present (orbital fat loss, loose skin, decreased subcutaneous fat noted on exam [date]) ✓"
- Edema: "Meets ASPEN physical exam criterion: nutritional edema present (pitting edema, kwashiorkor noted on exam [date]) ✓"
- Not met: "Does not meet ASPEN physical exam criterion - no muscle wasting, fat loss, or edema documented. Patient described as 'well appearing' ✗"

**COUNT INDICATORS:**
"ASPEN indicator count: [X]/4 indicators met. Malnutrition diagnosis requires ≥2 indicators (or ≥1 if severe z-score ≤-3.0)."

**STEP 3: MAKE BINARY CLASSIFICATION DECISION (v1.0.0)**

Based on documented criteria:

**MALNOURISHED** if:
- ≥2 ASPEN indicators present (anthropometric + intake, OR anthropometric + physical exam, etc.), OR
- Single severe indicator (z-score ≤-3.0, MUAC <115mm, nutritional edema) with clinical signs, OR
- WHO z-score <-2 (moderate/severe acute malnutrition) with corroborating evidence

**NOT MALNOURISHED** if:
- <2 ASPEN indicators present, AND
- No severe single indicators (z-score >-3.0, no edema), AND
- BMI/weight-for-height ≥-1.0 (normal range), OR
- BMI ≥85th percentile (overweight/obese), OR
- All z-scores positive (above average), OR
- Well-appearing with borderline measurements and <2 indicators

**STEP 4: PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION REASONING**

Document:
1. **Mandatory Exclusions Applied**:
   - BMI percentile check: [result] (If ≥85th → Not Malnourished)
   - Z-score sign check: [positive/negative/mixed] (All positive → Not Malnourished)
   - Clinical appearance: [well appearing / signs of wasting / etc.]

2. **Assessment Type**: [Single-point / Serial / Longitudinal] - [brief justification]
   - Single-point: Only one encounter or one set of measurements
   - Serial: Multiple measurements same encounter
   - Longitudinal: Multiple encounters with different dates

3. **ASPEN Indicators Met (need ≥2 for diagnosis):**
   - ☐ Anthropometric deficit (z-score <-1.0): [Yes/No] - [specific values]
   - ☐ Growth velocity/deceleration (longitudinal only): [Yes/No/Cannot assess] - [specific values]
   - ☐ Inadequate intake (<75% needs): [Yes/No/Not documented] - [specific evidence]
   - ☐ Physical exam findings (wasting/edema): [Yes/No] - [specific findings]
   - **Total indicators: [X]/4** (≥2 required for malnutrition)

4. **Conflict Resolution Applied**:
   - If BMI and weight-for-age conflict: [describe and resolution]
   - If documented diagnosis conflicts with measurements: [describe and resolution]
   - Hierarchy applied: BMI > weight-for-height > weight-for-age > clinical appearance

5. **Criteria Satisfied**: List each ASPEN/WHO criterion met with specific values
   - Example: "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN: BMI z-score -2.3 (anthropometric indicator) + inadequate intake 40% of needs x 2 weeks (intake indicator) = 2/4 indicators met"

6. **Criteria Not Met**: Note which standard criteria were assessed but not satisfied
   - Example: "Growth velocity cannot be assessed (single-point data). No physical exam findings of wasting documented."

7. **Missing Data**: Identify gaps and recommend specific assessments needed
   - Example: "Recommend: Serial BMI measurements monthly to assess velocity, dietary recall to quantify intake, physical exam focused on muscle/fat stores"

8. **Final Classification**: Malnourished or Not Malnourished (binary decision required)

9. **Severity** (if Malnourished): Mild, Moderate, or Severe
   - Based on lowest z-score OR most severe indicator met
   - Mild: z-score -1.0 to -1.9
   - Moderate: z-score -2.0 to -2.9
   - Severe: z-score ≤-3.0 OR MUAC <115mm OR nutritional edema

10. **Confidence**: High/Moderate/Low
    - High: ≥2 clear indicators, longitudinal data, severe deficits, clinical signs align
    - Moderate: 2 indicators but borderline values, single-point data limiting assessment
    - Low: Conflicting data, missing key information, documented diagnosis without supporting evidence

**ANONYMIZATION:** Use "the patient", "the child", "the [age]-year-old", "the infant"

**CRITICAL RULES (v1.0.0):**
1. ✅ **APPLY mandatory exclusions FIRST** (BMI ≥85th, all positive z-scores → Not Malnourished)
2. ✅ **STATE assessment type** before interpreting data (single-point/serial/longitudinal)
3. ❌ **DO NOT calculate trends** for single-point assessments (velocity, deceleration, percentile crossing)
4. ✅ **COUNT ASPEN indicators explicitly** - need ≥2 for diagnosis (or 1 if severe)
5. ❌ **DO NOT say "based on ASPEN criteria"** without specifying WHICH criterion
6. ✅ **DOCUMENT exact z-score/percentile values** with the criterion met
7. ✅ **USE conflict resolution hierarchy**: BMI > weight-for-height > weight-for-age > appearance
8. ❌ **DO NOT diagnose based on height-for-age alone** (stunting ≠ acute malnutrition)
9. ❌ **DO NOT diagnose based on descriptive terms** without objective measurements (z-scores)
10. ❌ **DO NOT accept documented malnutrition** without verifying with anthropometric data
11. ✅ **VERIFY clinical appearance aligns** with severity of deficits
12. ✅ **MAKE clear binary decision**: Malnourished or Not Malnourished (no "possible" or "uncertain")
13. ✅ **RECOMMEND serial measurements** if single-point limits assessment
14. ❌ **DO NOT interpret positive z-scores** as malnutrition indicators
15. ❌ **ALL z-scores below 50th percentile MUST be negative**

## CRITICAL REMINDERS (v1.0.0)

1. ❌ **DO NOT** diagnose malnutrition if BMI ≥85th percentile (overweight/obese)
2. ❌ **DO NOT** diagnose malnutrition if all z-scores are positive (above average)
3. ❌ **DO NOT** diagnose with <2 ASPEN indicators unless severe single indicator (z ≤-3.0, edema)
4. ❌ **DO NOT** diagnose based on height-for-age alone (stunting without wasting)
5. ❌ **DO NOT** accept documented malnutrition codes without objective anthropometric verification
6. ❌ **DO NOT** calculate velocity/deceleration/trends for single-point assessments
7. ❌ **DO NOT** use descriptive terms ("failure to thrive") as primary diagnostic criteria
8. ❌ **DO NOT** confuse weight-for-age (composite) with BMI/weight-for-height (acute indicators)
9. ❌ **DO NOT** ignore "well appearing" clinical gestalt when borderline measurements present
10. ✅ **DO** apply conflict resolution hierarchy (BMI > weight-for-height > appearance)
11. ✅ **DO** distinguish single-point vs longitudinal data capabilities
12. ✅ **DO** count ASPEN indicators explicitly (need ≥2)
