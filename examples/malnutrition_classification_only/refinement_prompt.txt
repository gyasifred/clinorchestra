Refine malnutrition classification using ASPEN/WHO clinical guidelines with clinical judgment to ensure accurate criteria documentation.

**TASK:** Validate and enhance the initial classification against ASPEN consensus criteria and WHO guidelines.

**INITIAL CLASSIFICATION:**
{initial_classification}

**CLINICAL GUIDELINES PROVIDED:**
{rag_context}

*** REFINEMENT OBJECTIVES ***

**1. VALIDATE ASSESSMENT TYPE**
- Confirm whether single-point, serial, or longitudinal is correct based on available data
- Ensure interpretation matches assessment type capabilities:
  * Single-point: Current status only, NO trend analysis
  * Serial/Longitudinal: Trends, velocity, percentile trajectory analysis
- For single-point: Verify no trend analysis was attempted; if present, remove and note limitation
- For serial/longitudinal: Verify trends were calculated; if missing, calculate and add

**2. VALIDATE CRITERIA SPECIFICITY**
Check that each criterion is documented with SPECIFIC values, not generic statements:

❌ WRONG EXAMPLES:
- "Based on ASPEN criteria for moderate malnutrition"
- "Growth velocity decline indicates malnutrition"
- "Low BMI suggests undernutrition"
- "Z-scores below normal"

✓ CORRECT EXAMPLES:
- "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -2 to -2.9 (BMI-for-age z-score -2.3)"
- "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN velocity criterion decline of 2 z-scores (z-score declined from -0.5 to -2.5 over 3 months)"
- "Severe malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score < -3 (weight-for-height z-score -3.2)"
- "Mild malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -1 to -1.9 (BMI-for-age z-score -1.5)"

**3. VALIDATE Z-SCORE CONVENTION AND INTERPRETATION**

**CRITICAL Z-SCORE RULES:**
- Percentile <50th MUST have NEGATIVE z-score
- Common conversions:
  * 3rd percentile = z-score -1.88 (NOT +1.88)
  * 5th percentile = z-score -1.64
  * 10th percentile = z-score -1.28
  * 25th percentile = z-score -0.67
  * 50th percentile = z-score 0
- Negative z-scores indicate below average (primary malnutrition indicator)
- Positive z-scores indicate above average (contradicts malnutrition)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If percentile is <50th but z-score is positive → INCORRECT, convert to negative
- If child described as "low percentile" but z-score is positive → INCORRECT
- If BMI/weight described as "low" but z-score is positive or ≥0 → INCORRECT

**4. VALIDATE ASPEN INDICATOR COUNT**

**ASPEN DIAGNOSTIC THRESHOLD:** Requires ≥2 of 4 indicators for malnutrition diagnosis

**Count ALL indicators present:**
1. Anthropometric deficit (z-score < -1)
2. Growth velocity decline (z-score drop ≥1) - requires multiple measurements
3. Inadequate nutrient intake (<75% needs ≥1 week)
4. Physical examination findings (muscle wasting, fat loss, edema)

**VALIDATION RULES:**
- If count <2 but classified as malnourished → Check if WHO criteria (z < -2) justify this
- If count ≥2 but classified as not malnourished → Re-evaluate classification
- State count explicitly: "X/4 ASPEN indicators met (need 2+ for diagnosis)"

**5. VALIDATE CLINICAL JUDGMENT APPLICATION**

**ASPEN REQUIREMENT:** Clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exercised throughout.

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SCENARIOS:**

**SCENARIO A: Documented Malnutrition with Contradictory Evidence**
Evidence of contradiction:
- Normal or high anthropometric measurements (z-score ≥ -1, BMI ≥25)
- Good clinical appearance: "well appearing", "NAD", "alert and active"
- Adequate nutrition: "eating well", "good appetite", meeting estimated needs

Action: Apply clinical judgment - documented diagnosis may be prophylactic coding, historical, or risk-based rather than current malnutrition. Prioritize objective ASPEN evidence.

**SCENARIO B: Borderline Measurements Requiring Context**
Evidence requiring judgment:
- Z-scores near threshold (-1.0 to -1.2)
- Conflicting indicators (one severe, others normal)
- Complex medical conditions affecting interpretation

Action: Consider clinical context, growth patterns, medical conditions, and apply expert clinical judgment.

**6. CORRECT MISCLASSIFICATIONS**

**COMMON ERRORS TO FIX:**
- Single-point assessment with trend calculations → Remove trends, note limitation, recommend serial monitoring
- Serial/longitudinal assessment without trends → Add trend calculations (change, %, velocity, percentile crossing)
- Generic criterion statements → Replace with specific documentation including exact values
- Incorrect z-score signs → Correct (below 50th percentile = negative)
- Incorrect ASPEN count → Recount, adjust classification if needed
- Documented malnutrition contradicting objective evidence → Apply clinical judgment, may reclassify based on ASPEN criteria

**7. ENHANCE MISSING ELEMENTS**

**ADD IF MISSING:**
- Specific criterion documentation (which criterion, exact threshold, measured value)
- Trend calculations for serial/longitudinal (absolute change, %, velocity, percentile crossing)
- Severity level with criterion reference (mild/moderate/severe based on specific ASPEN/WHO threshold)
- ASPEN indicator count ("X/4 indicators met")
- Clinical judgment rationale when evidence is conflicting or borderline
- Recommendations for missing data (e.g., "Serial measurements recommended at 1-2 week intervals to assess growth velocity per ASPEN monitoring guidelines")

*** VALIDATION CHECKLIST ***

Complete before finalizing:
□ Assessment type clearly stated and justified
□ All criteria documented with SPECIFIC values and thresholds
□ Z-score signs correct (below 50th = negative)
□ Trends calculated ONLY for serial/longitudinal (or noted as limitation for single-point)
□ ASPEN indicator count accurate and explicitly stated (X/4 indicators, need ≥2)
□ Classification matches indicator count (≥2 for malnutrition) OR WHO criteria (z < -2)
□ Severity level specified with criterion reference
□ Clinical judgment applied to contradictory or borderline evidence
□ Missing data identified with specific recommendations

*** CRITICAL RULES ***

- Only change classification if there's clear evidence of error based on ASPEN/WHO criteria
- Preserve accurate elements from initial classification
- Focus on making criteria documentation SPECIFIC with exact values
- Ensure assessment type drives interpretation approach (single-point vs. serial/longitudinal)
- Verify ASPEN diagnostic threshold (≥2 indicators) is met for malnutrition classification
- All z-scores below 50th percentile must be negative
- Apply clinical judgment when documented diagnosis contradicts objective evidence
- Exercise clinical expertise throughout the refinement process
