*** REFINEMENT OBJECTIVES (v1.0.0) ***

**STEP 0: VALIDATE MANDATORY EXCLUSIONS FIRST**

**1. BMI/WEIGHT EXCLUSION RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
- CRITICAL: If BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile (z-score ≥+1.04) → MUST classify as Not Malnourished
- CRITICAL: If BMI ≥25 kg/m² → MUST classify as Not Malnourished (overweight/obese)
- CRITICAL: If weight-for-height ≥85th percentile → MUST classify as Not Malnourished
- **Overweight/obese children CANNOT have acute malnutrition by definition**
- Note: Stunting (height-for-age deficit) can coexist with overweight, but does NOT equal malnutrition diagnosis

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If classified as Malnourished but BMI ≥85th percentile → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished
- If classified as Malnourished but BMI ≥25 kg/m² → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished
- If BMI is normal/high → Overrides other indicators, malnutrition diagnosis INVALID

**2. POSITIVE Z-SCORE STOP RULE:**
- CRITICAL: If ALL measured z-scores are POSITIVE (≥0) → MUST classify as Not Malnourished
- Positive z-scores indicate above-average growth, incompatible with malnutrition
- Exception ONLY: Historical documented malnutrition with recent recovery (document trajectory showing improvement)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If classified as Malnourished but all z-scores positive → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished
- If BMI z-score +0.5, weight z-score +0.2 → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (above average = healthy)
- Verify z-score signs match percentiles (<50th = negative, >50th = positive)

**3. DESCRIPTIVE TERM WARNING:**
- Terms like "failure to thrive", "poor weight gain", "feeding difficulty" WITHOUT objective z-scores <-1.0 are INSUFFICIENT for diagnosis
- Require actual anthropometric measurements meeting ASPEN thresholds (z-score <-1.0)
- Document these terms but do NOT use as primary diagnostic criteria without measurements

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If classified as Malnourished based only on "failure to thrive" without z-scores <-1.0 → RECLASSIFY or note insufficient documentation
- If "poor weight gain" documented but z-scores normal/positive → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished

**4. DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS SKEPTICISM:**
- ICD codes for malnutrition (E43, E44, E45, E46) may represent:
 * Prophylactic coding for high-risk patients
 * Historical diagnosis no longer active
 * Risk-based documentation, not current nutritional status
 * Coding for reimbursement purposes
- MUST verify with objective anthropometric data

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If malnutrition ICD code present but normal BMI/z-scores → Prioritize objective measurements, likely prophylactic coding
- If documented malnutrition contradicts normal/high measurements → RECLASSIFY based on anthropometric data

**5. "WELL-APPEARING" CLINICAL GESTALT:**
- If patient described as "well appearing", "well nourished", "NAD" (no acute distress) AND z-scores borderline (-1.0 to -1.5) → Err toward Not Malnourished unless 2+ clear indicators present
- Clinical appearance should align with severity of anthropometric deficits
- Severe malnutrition (z-score ≤-3.0) should have clinical signs (visible wasting, muscle loss)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If "well appearing" + mild z-score (-1.2) + <2 indicators → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished
- If severe z-score (≤-3.0) but "well appearing, active, alert" → Review data quality, consider measurement error

**1. VALIDATE ASSESSMENT TYPE**

**CRITICAL RULE:** Match interpretation to assessment type capabilities

**SINGLE-POINT:** Only one encounter OR one set of measurements documented
- CAN assess: Current anthropometric status, single z-scores
- CANNOT assess: Trends, velocity, deceleration, weight loss percentage, percentile crossing
- CANNOT claim: "Declining growth velocity", "Deceleration", "Percentile crossing downward"
- Limitations: No trajectory information, cannot determine if acute vs chronic

**SERIAL:** Multiple measurements from same encounter/visit
- CAN assess: Short-term trends within hospitalization (days)
- May assess: Acute changes, recovery patterns
- Limitations: Limited time frame, may not represent baseline

**LONGITUDINAL:** Multiple measurements across DIFFERENT encounters with DIFFERENT dates
- CAN assess: Growth velocity, percentile trajectory, z-score deceleration (ASPEN two-point indicators)
- Gold standard: Allows comparison to baseline, assessment of chronicity
- Required for: ASPEN velocity indicators (weight gain velocity, deceleration)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If single-point assessment but claims "declining velocity" or "percentile crossing" → REMOVE trend analysis, note limitation
- If longitudinal data available but NO trends calculated → ADD trend calculations (absolute change, %, velocity, z-score decline)
- Ensure interpretation matches data availability

**2. VALIDATE CONFLICT RESOLUTION HIERARCHY (v1.0.0)**

When anthropometric measurements conflict, use this hierarchy:

**1. BMI-for-age (HIGHEST PRIORITY for acute nutritional status)**
- Most sensitive for acute malnutrition (wasting)
- If BMI z-score is normal/high → Overrides other indicators suggesting malnutrition
- If BMI z-score is -1.2 but weight-for-age is -2.5 → Trust BMI, likely short stature

**2. Weight-for-height z-score (SECONDARY for acute status)**
- Alternative to BMI for acute malnutrition assessment
- If weight-for-height is normal → Likely not acutely malnourished

**3. Weight-for-age z-score (COMPOSITE - less specific)**
- Influenced by both height and weight
- Can be low due to short stature alone (NOT malnutrition)
- Use with caution, verify with BMI or weight-for-height

**4. Height-for-age z-score (CHRONIC indicator only)**
- Indicates stunting (chronic malnutrition or other causes)
- Does NOT diagnose acute malnutrition
- Stunting alone (isolated height deficit with normal BMI) = Not Malnourished by ASPEN

**5. Clinical appearance (CONTEXT, not primary criterion)**
- Provides corroborating evidence
- Should align with severity of anthropometric deficits
- If conflicts with objective measurements → Prioritize measurements

**EXAMPLE CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS:**
- BMI z-score +0.5, weight-for-age z-score -2.0 → Not Malnourished (normal BMI, short stature)
- BMI z-score -1.2, described as "well appearing" → Mild malnutrition IF 2+ indicators (prioritize objective data)
- Height-for-age z-score -2.5, BMI z-score +0.2 → Not Malnourished (stunted but not wasted)
- Weight-for-height z-score -2.2, BMI z-score -0.5 → Trust BMI (use for ≥2 years), likely measurement error

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If conflicting measurements present → Apply hierarchy, document which measurement used and why
- If height-for-age z-score used alone for diagnosis → INCORRECT, must have acute indicator (BMI or weight-for-height)
- If weight-for-age low but BMI normal → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (short stature, not wasted)

**3. VALIDATE CRITERIA SPECIFICITY**

Check that each criterion is documented with SPECIFIC values, not generic statements:

 WRONG EXAMPLES:
- "Based on ASPEN criteria for moderate malnutrition"
- "Growth velocity decline indicates malnutrition"
- "Low BMI suggests undernutrition"
- "Z-scores below normal"

[x] CORRECT EXAMPLES:
- "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -2.0 to -2.9 (BMI-for-age z-score -2.3)"
- "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN velocity criterion decline of 2 z-scores (z-score declined from -0.5 to -2.5 over 3 months)"
- "Severe malnutrition per WHO criterion z-score < -3 (weight-for-height z-score -3.2)"
- "Mild malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -1.0 to -1.9 (BMI-for-age z-score -1.5)"

**4. VALIDATE Z-SCORE CONVENTION AND INTERPRETATION (v1.0.0)**

**CRITICAL Z-SCORE RULES:**
- **Negative z-scores (<0)** indicate measurements BELOW average → May indicate malnutrition
- **Positive z-scores (>0)** indicate measurements ABOVE average → EXCLUDES malnutrition
- **Z-score 0** = exactly 50th percentile (average)
- **Percentile <50th MUST have NEGATIVE z-scores**
- **Percentile >50th MUST have POSITIVE z-scores**

**Common conversions:**
- 3rd percentile = z-score -1.88 (NOT +1.88)
- 5th percentile = z-score -1.64
- 10th percentile = z-score -1.28
- 25th percentile = z-score -0.67
- 50th percentile = z-score 0
- 75th percentile = z-score +0.67
- 85th percentile = z-score +1.04 (OVERWEIGHT THRESHOLD)
- 95th percentile = z-score +1.64

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If percentile <50th but z-score is positive → INCORRECT, convert to negative
- If child described as "low percentile" but z-score is positive → INCORRECT
- If BMI/weight described as "low" but z-score is positive or ≥0 → INCORRECT, contradictory
- If "3rd percentile" documented as z-score +1.88 → INCORRECT, should be -1.88

**5. VALIDATE ASPEN INDICATOR COUNT (v1.0.0 CRITICAL)**

**ASPEN DIAGNOSTIC THRESHOLD:** Requires ≥2 of 4 indicators for malnutrition diagnosis (OR 1 severe indicator)

**Count ALL indicators present:**
1. [ ] Anthropometric deficit (z-score <-1.0) - BMI, weight-for-height, MUAC
2. [ ] Growth velocity decline (z-score drop ≥1) - REQUIRES LONGITUDINAL DATA
3. [ ] Inadequate nutrient intake (<75% needs for ≥1 week) - REQUIRES DOCUMENTATION
4. [ ] Physical examination findings (muscle wasting, fat loss, nutritional edema)

**VALIDATION RULES:**
- If count <2 AND no severe indicator (z ≤-3.0, edema) → RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished
- If count ≥2 but classified as Not Malnourished → RECLASSIFY as Malnourished
- State count explicitly: "X/4 ASPEN indicators met (need ≥2 for diagnosis)"
- WHO criteria (z <-2) may support diagnosis with 1 ASPEN indicator

**SINGLE INDICATOR EXCEPTION:**
- Severe indicators (z-score ≤-3.0, MUAC <115mm, nutritional edema) may be sufficient for diagnosis IF clinically evident severe malnutrition with visible wasting/muscle loss
- Moderate/mild malnutrition ALWAYS requires ≥2 indicators

**EXAMPLES:**
- BMI z-score -1.5 only (no other indicators) → <2 indicators → Not Malnourished
- Height-for-age z-score -2.2 only (stunting without wasting) → <2 indicators → Not Malnourished
- BMI z-score -2.1 + inadequate intake documented → 2 indicators → Malnourished
- Weight-for-height z-score -1.8 + muscle wasting on exam → 2 indicators → Malnourished
- BMI z-score -3.5 + visible wasting → Severe indicator + clinical signs → Malnourished

**6. VALIDATE CLINICAL JUDGMENT APPLICATION**

**ASPEN REQUIREMENT:** Clinical expertise and sound clinical judgment must be exercised throughout.

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT SCENARIOS:**

**SCENARIO A: Documented Malnutrition with Contradictory Evidence**
Evidence of contradiction:
- Normal or high anthropometric measurements (z-score ≥-1, BMI ≥85th percentile, BMI ≥25 kg/m²)
- Positive z-scores (all measurements above average)
- Good clinical appearance: "well appearing", "NAD", "alert and active", "well nourished"
- Adequate nutrition: "eating well", "good appetite", "meeting ≥75% estimated needs"

Action: Apply clinical judgment - documented diagnosis may be prophylactic coding, historical, or risk-based rather than current malnutrition. **Prioritize objective ASPEN evidence**, RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished if BMI/z-scores normal or positive.

**SCENARIO B: Borderline Measurements Requiring Context**
Evidence requiring judgment:
- Z-scores near threshold (-0.8 to -1.2) - borderline
- Conflicting indicators (BMI normal but weight-for-age low = short stature, not malnutrition)
- "Well appearing" with borderline z-scores + <2 indicators
- Complex medical conditions (congenital heart disease, genetic syndromes affecting growth)

Action: Consider clinical context, apply conflict resolution hierarchy (BMI > weight-for-age), growth patterns, and apply expert clinical judgment. If borderline + well appearing + <2 indicators → Not Malnourished.

**7. CORRECT COMMON MISCLASSIFICATIONS (v1.0.0)**

**ERROR #1: Classifying overweight children as malnourished**
- BMI ≥85th percentile or BMI ≥25 kg/m²
- Classified as Malnourished
- FIX: RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (mandatory exclusion)

**ERROR #2: Diagnosing based on positive z-scores**
- All z-scores positive (above average)
- Classified as Malnourished
- FIX: RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (above average = healthy)

**ERROR #3: Single-point assessment with trend calculations**
- Assessment type: Single-point
- Claims: "Declining velocity", "Percentile crossing", "Deceleration"
- FIX: REMOVE trend analysis, note limitation, recommend serial monitoring

**ERROR #4: Serial/longitudinal assessment without trends**
- Assessment type: Longitudinal (multiple encounters with dates)
- No trend calculations provided
- FIX: ADD trend calculations (absolute change, %, velocity, percentile crossing, z-score decline)

**ERROR #5: Generic criterion statements**
- "Based on ASPEN criteria for moderate malnutrition" (non-specific)
- FIX: Replace with "Moderate malnutrition per ASPEN anthropometric criterion z-score -2.0 to -2.9 (BMI-for-age z-score -2.3)"

**ERROR #6: Incorrect z-score signs**
- 5th percentile documented as z-score +1.64 (should be -1.64)
- FIX: Correct to negative (below 50th percentile = negative)

**ERROR #7: Incorrect ASPEN count**
- Only 1 indicator present (BMI z-score -1.5)
- Classified as Malnourished
- FIX: Recount indicators, RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (<2 indicators)

**ERROR #8: Documented malnutrition contradicting objective evidence**
- ICD code E43 (severe malnutrition) present
- BMI 27 kg/m² (overweight)
- FIX: Apply clinical judgment, RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (prioritize objective measurements, likely prophylactic coding)

**ERROR #9: Height-for-age alone used for diagnosis**
- Height-for-age z-score -2.5 (stunting)
- BMI z-score +0.2 (normal)
- Classified as Malnourished
- FIX: RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (stunting alone does NOT equal acute malnutrition, need wasting)

**ERROR #10: "Well appearing" ignored with borderline measurements**
- Clinical note: "Well appearing, active, alert"
- BMI z-score -1.1 (borderline)
- No other indicators
- Classified as Malnourished
- FIX: RECLASSIFY as Not Malnourished (clinical gestalt + borderline + <2 indicators)

**8. ENHANCE MISSING ELEMENTS**

**ADD IF MISSING:**
- Mandatory exclusion checks applied (BMI ≥85th, positive z-scores)
- Assessment type determination (single-point vs longitudinal)
- Specific criterion documentation (which criterion, exact threshold, measured value)
- Conflict resolution applied (which measurement prioritized if conflicting)
- Trend calculations for longitudinal data (absolute change, %, velocity, percentile crossing)
- Severity level with criterion reference (mild/moderate/severe based on specific ASPEN/WHO threshold)
- ASPEN indicator count ("X/4 indicators met, need ≥2 for diagnosis")
- Clinical judgment rationale when evidence is conflicting or borderline
- Recommendations for missing data (e.g., "Serial measurements recommended at 1-2 week intervals to assess growth velocity per ASPEN monitoring guidelines")

*** CRITICAL RULES (v1.0.0) ***

1. **APPLY mandatory exclusions FIRST** (BMI ≥85th, all positive z-scores → Not Malnourished) - NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. **STATE assessment type** before interpreting data (single-point/serial/longitudinal)
3. **DO NOT calculate trends** for single-point assessments (velocity, deceleration, percentile crossing)
4. **COUNT ASPEN indicators explicitly** - need ≥2 for diagnosis (or 1 if severe)
5. **DO NOT say "based on ASPEN criteria"** without specifying WHICH criterion with exact values
6. **DOCUMENT exact z-score/percentile values** with the criterion met
7. **USE conflict resolution hierarchy**: BMI > weight-for-height > weight-for-age > appearance
8. **DO NOT diagnose based on height-for-age alone** (stunting ≠ acute malnutrition)
9. **DO NOT diagnose based on descriptive terms** without objective measurements (z-scores <-1.0)
10. **DO NOT accept documented malnutrition** without verifying with anthropometric data
11. **VERIFY clinical appearance aligns** with severity of deficits
12. **MAKE clear binary decision**: Malnourished or Not Malnourished (no "possible" or "uncertain")
13. **RECOMMEND serial measurements** if single-point limits assessment
14. **DO NOT interpret positive z-scores** as malnutrition indicators
15. **ALL z-scores below 50th percentile MUST be negative**

## CRITICAL REMINDERS (v1.0.0)

1. **DO NOT** diagnose malnutrition if BMI ≥85th percentile (overweight/obese) - MANDATORY EXCLUSION
2. **DO NOT** diagnose malnutrition if all z-scores are positive (above average) - MANDATORY EXCLUSION
3. **DO NOT** diagnose with <2 ASPEN indicators unless severe single indicator (z ≤-3.0, edema)
4. **DO NOT** diagnose based on height-for-age alone (stunting without wasting)
5. **DO NOT** accept documented malnutrition codes without objective anthropometric verification
6. **DO NOT** calculate velocity/deceleration/trends for single-point assessments
7. **DO NOT** use descriptive terms ("failure to thrive") as primary diagnostic criteria without z-scores
8. **DO NOT** confuse weight-for-age (composite) with BMI/weight-for-height (acute indicators)
9. **DO NOT** ignore "well appearing" clinical gestalt when borderline measurements + <2 indicators present
10. **DO** apply conflict resolution hierarchy (BMI > weight-for-height > appearance)
11. **DO** distinguish single-point vs longitudinal data capabilities
12. **DO** count ASPEN indicators explicitly (need ≥2)
13. **DO** verify clinical signs align with severity of anthropometric deficits
14. **DO** prioritize objective measurements over ICD codes/documentation
15. **DO** make clear binary decision with confidence level based on mandatory exclusions

**REFINEMENT PHILOSOPHY (v1.0.0):**
- **Enforce mandatory exclusions FIRST** - BMI ≥85th and all positive z-scores MUST result in Not Malnourished
- **Prioritize objective measurements** over documented codes, descriptive terms, or clinical notes
- **Apply conflict resolution systematically** - BMI beats weight-for-age, measurements beat appearance
- **Count indicators explicitly** - Transparency in whether ≥2 ASPEN indicators met
- **Validate against retrieved guidelines** - Ensure ASPEN/WHO criteria properly applied
- **Document reasoning transparently** - Explain mandatory exclusions, conflict resolutions, and classification rationale

Return refined classification with guideline-validated criteria, mandatory exclusions enforced, and appropriate confidence based on v1.0.0 safeguards.
