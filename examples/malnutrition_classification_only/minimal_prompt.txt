Pediatric malnutrition classification using ASPEN consensus criteria with clinical judgment.

**CLINICAL TEXT:**
{clinical_text}

**ICD LABELS:**
{icd_labels}

**TOOLS:**
{tool_outputs}

**SCHEMA:**
{json_schema}

**TASK:** Classify as Malnourished or Not Malnourished based on ASPEN/WHO clinical evidence.

**ASPEN CRITERIA** (need 2+ of 4 indicators):
1. Anthropometric deficit (z-score < -1):
   - Mild: -1.0 to -1.9 | Moderate: -2.0 to -2.9 | Severe: ≤-3.0
2. Growth velocity decline (requires multiple measurements):
   - Mild: 1 z-score drop | Moderate: 2 z-score drop | Severe: 3+ z-score drop
3. Inadequate intake (<75% needs ≥1 week):
   - Mild: 51-75% | Moderate: 26-50% | Severe: ≤25%
4. Physical findings: muscle wasting, fat loss, nutritional edema

**WHO CLASSIFICATION:**
- z < -2: Malnutrition present
- z ≥ -2 but < -1: At-risk, not malnutrition
- z ≥ -1: Normal nutritional status

**Z-SCORE CRITICAL RULES:**
- Percentile <50th MUST have NEGATIVE z-score
- 3rd percentile = z-score -1.88
- 5th percentile = z-score -1.64
- 10th percentile = z-score -1.28
- Negative z-scores indicate below average (malnutrition indicator)

**CLINICAL JUDGMENT:** Exercise throughout assessment. If documented malnutrition contradicts objective evidence (normal z-scores, "well appearing", adequate intake), critically evaluate using ASPEN criteria.

**ASSESSMENT TYPE:**
- Single-point: One measurement - assess current status only, no trends
- Serial/Longitudinal: Multiple measurements - assess trends and velocity

**CLASSIFICATION:**
- **Malnourished**: 2+ ASPEN indicators OR WHO z < -2 OR clinical evidence with ASPEN criteria
- **Not Malnourished**: <2 ASPEN indicators AND WHO z ≥ -2 AND no clinical evidence meeting criteria

**REASONING:** State assessment type, specific criteria met with exact values, ASPEN indicator count (e.g., "2/4 indicators met"), severity if malnourished, and confidence level.

**ANONYMIZATION:** Use "the patient", "the child", "the [age]-year-old"

**OUTPUT:** JSON with "reasoning" (comprehensive clinical analysis) and "status" ("Malnourished" or "Not Malnourished").
