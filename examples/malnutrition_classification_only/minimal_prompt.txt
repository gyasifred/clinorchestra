Classify pediatric malnutrition status from clinical notes.

**STEP 1: Determine Assessment Type**
- Single-point: One measurement set
- Serial/Longitudinal: Multiple measurements with dates

**STEP 2: Extract Key Indicators**

Anthropometric (with dates and z-scores):
- Weight-for-height, BMI-for-age, weight-for-age
- WHO: z < -2 indicates malnutrition (< -3 severe, -3 to -2 moderate)
- ASPEN: z < -1 indicates risk (-3 severe, -2 to -2.9 moderate, -1 to -1.9 mild)

Growth Velocity (serial/longitudinal only):
- ASPEN: Decline ≥2 z-scores = concern
- Single-point: Cannot assess - note this limitation

Intake:
- <50% estimated needs for ≥1 week = ASPEN criterion met

Physical Exam:
- Muscle wasting, fat loss, temporal wasting

**STEP 3: Count ASPEN Indicators**
Need 2+ of: Anthropometric deficit, Growth deceleration, Inadequate intake, Physical findings

**STEP 4: Classify**
- "Malnourished": ≥2 ASPEN indicators OR WHO z-score < -2
- "Not Malnourished": <2 indicators AND z-scores normal

Document which specific criteria met (e.g., "z-score -2.3 meets ASPEN moderate criterion -2 to -2.9")

**OUTPUT:**
{
  "malnutrition_status": "Malnourished" | "Not Malnourished",
  "reasoning": "Assessment type: [Single/Serial/Longitudinal]. Criteria met: [specific WHO/ASPEN criteria with values]. ASPEN indicators: [count]/[needed]. Severity: [level]"
}

**Rules:**
- State assessment type first
- Don't assess trends for single-point
- Specify exact criteria met, not just "based on ASPEN"
- Count ASPEN indicators explicitly
