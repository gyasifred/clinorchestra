3. Inadequate intake (<50% needs ≥1 week)
4. Physical findings (muscle wasting/fat loss)

**WHO Classification:**
- z < -2: Malnutrition present
- z ≥ -2: Normal or at-risk only

**CLASSIFICATION:**
- **Malnourished**: 2+ ASPEN indicators OR WHO z < -2
- **Not Malnourished**: <2 ASPEN indicators AND z ≥ -2
