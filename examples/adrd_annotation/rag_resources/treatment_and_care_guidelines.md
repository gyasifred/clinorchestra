# ADRD Treatment and Care Management Guidelines

This document provides evidence-based guidelines for pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacological interventions, care planning, caregiver support, and safety management in dementia.

## 💊 PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES

### Cholinesterase Inhibitors

**Korean Dementia Association Clinical Practice Guidelines (2025)**
Dement Neurocogn Disord 2025;24(1):1-15

**Strong Recommendations:**
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) are strongly recommended for Alzheimer's disease to improve cognition and daily function
- Strong recommendation for Lewy body dementia
- Conditional recommendation for vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia

**Approved Medications:**

| Medication | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Administration |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Donepezil** | 5 mg daily | 10-23 mg daily | Once daily, evening |
| **Rivastigmine** | 1.5 mg BID | 6 mg BID or 9.5-13.3 mg patch daily | With meals; patch is preferred for GI side effects |
| **Galantamine** | 4 mg BID | 12 mg BID or 24 mg ER daily | With meals |

**Efficacy:**
- Pooled trials demonstrate ~1.4 point improvement on 30-point MMSE over 6 months
- Benefits seen in cognition, global function, and activities of daily living
- Symptomatic treatment; does not modify disease course

**Side Effects (up to 30% of patients):**
- Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Neurological: headache, dizziness, insomnia
- Cardiovascular: bradycardia, syncope
- Other: muscle cramps, weight loss

**Contraindications/Cautions:**
- Cardiac conduction abnormalities
- Active peptic ulcer disease
- Asthma/COPD (cholinergic effects)
- Urinary obstruction

**Monitoring:**
- ECG at baseline and periodically (especially donepezil)
- Weight monitoring
- GI symptoms
- Cognitive and functional assessments every 6 months

### Memantine

**Indication:** Moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Starting Dose** | 5 mg daily |
| **Titration** | Increase by 5 mg weekly |
| **Target Dose** | 10 mg BID or 28 mg ER daily |
| **Renal Adjustment** | Reduce dose if CrCl <30 mL/min |

**Efficacy:**
- Significant improvements in cognition and function in moderate-severe AD
- May be used as monotherapy or added to cholinesterase inhibitor
- Better tolerated than cholinesterase inhibitors

**Side Effects:**
- Dizziness, headache, confusion
- Constipation
- Hypertension (rare)

**Additional Uses:**
- May improve behavioral symptoms
- May help REM sleep behavior disorder in LBD/PDD

### Combination Therapy

- May add memantine to cholinesterase inhibitor for moderate-severe AD
- Fixed-dose combination (donepezil 10 mg + memantine ER 28 mg) available
- No evidence that combination is superior to monotherapy in mild AD

### Behavioral and Psychological Symptom Management

**Korean Dementia Association BPSD Guidelines (2025)**
Dement Neurocogn Disord 2025;24(1):16-29

**First-Line: Non-pharmacological interventions** (see below)

**Pharmacological Options by Symptom:**

**Depression:**
- SSRIs preferred: sertraline 25-100 mg, citalopram 10-20 mg (max 20 mg due to QTc)
- Avoid tricyclics (anticholinergic)
- Mirtazapine for poor appetite/insomnia

**Anxiety:**
- SSRIs first-line
- Buspirone 5-15 mg BID
- Avoid benzodiazepines (falls, paradoxical agitation, cognitive worsening)

**Agitation/Aggression:**
- Trial of cholinesterase inhibitor adjustment first
- Citalopram 10-20 mg (evidence for agitation)
- Trazodone 25-100 mg (especially evening agitation)
- Antipsychotics: ONLY for severe symptoms with danger to self/others

**Antipsychotic Warnings:**
⚠️ **FDA Black Box Warning**: Increased mortality in elderly with dementia
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration
- Risk of stroke, death, metabolic effects, parkinsonism
- Requires informed consent discussion
- Avoid in DLB (severe sensitivity)

**Preferred antipsychotics (if necessary):**
- Risperidone 0.25-1 mg
- Quetiapine 12.5-100 mg (preferred in DLB/PDD)
- Aripiprazole 2-10 mg

**Sleep Disturbances:**
- Melatonin 3-10 mg (first-line)
- Trazodone 25-50 mg
- Suvorexant 10-20 mg (approved for insomnia in dementia)
- Avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergics

**Psychosis:**
- Consider triggers (UTI, medication, pain)
- Cholinesterase inhibitors may help in DLB
- Pimavanserin 34 mg (approved for PD psychosis, used off-label)
- Low-dose antipsychotics if severe/dangerous

### Emerging Treatments

**Disease-Modifying Anti-Amyloid Therapies:**

**Lecanemab (Leqembi):**
- FDA approved January 2023
- 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- 27% slowing of decline on CDR-SB at 18 months
- Eligibility: Early AD (MCI or mild dementia), amyloid-positive
- Risks: ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) - edema and microhemorrhages
- Requires MRI monitoring

**Donanemab:**
- FDA approved July 2024
- Monthly IV infusion until amyloid clearance
- 35% slowing of decline in some studies
- Similar eligibility and monitoring to lecanemab

**Contraindications for Anti-Amyloid Therapy:**
