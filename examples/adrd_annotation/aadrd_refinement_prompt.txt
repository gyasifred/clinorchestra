Refine ADRD classification using clinical guidelines.

**INITIAL CLASSIFICATION:**
{initial_classification}

**CLINICAL GUIDELINES:**
{rag_context}

**TASK:** Validate and refine the classification against AA 2024 Guidelines.

**VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
1. Severity matches functional status (MCI=preserved, Dementia=impaired)
2. Syndrome pattern consistent with affected domains
3. Etiology supported by clinical features
4. Confidence level appropriate for available evidence

**REFINEMENT FOCUS:**
- Fill gaps in rationale using retrieved guidelines
- Verify criteria application (NIA-AA, CDR staging)
- Strengthen differential considerations
- Ensure clinical judgment is documented

Return refined classification with enhanced rationale.
