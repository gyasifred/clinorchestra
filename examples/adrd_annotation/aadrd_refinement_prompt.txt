As a neurocognitive disorder specialist, provide detailed diagnostic formulation:

1. Cognitive Functional Status: CDR level or severity (no impairment/MCI/mild/moderate/severe dementia)
   - Base on functional assessment (IADL/ADL scores) and clinical description
   - MCI requires preserved functional independence
   - Dementia requires functional impairment

2. Cognitive-Behavioral Syndrome: Dominant pattern and affected domains
   - Memory, executive, visuospatial, language, behavior
   - NIA-AA dementia requires >=2 domains affected
   - Identify predominant syndrome pattern

3. Etiological Classification:
   - ADRD or Non-ADRD
   - If ADRD: specific type (AD/VaD/DLB/FTD/Mixed/Other)
   - If Non-ADRD: likely cause (delirium/psychiatric/medical)

4. Diagnostic Confidence: High/Moderate/Low with clinical rationale
   - High: Clear presentation meeting established criteria
   - Moderate: Likely diagnosis but some uncertainty
   - Low: Insufficient information or atypical presentation

5. Supporting Evidence: Key clinical features from notes and assessment results
   - Cite specific findings supporting your formulation
   - Note cognitive test scores and functional assessments

6. Differential Considerations: Other possibilities to consider
   - List alternative diagnoses that should be ruled out
   - Note what additional information would help clarify

Base formulation on NIA-AA criteria, assessment data, and clinical judgment.
Integrate all available information - no single test is diagnostic.
Remember: Missing documentation does NOT equal absence of impairment.
