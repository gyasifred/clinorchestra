[ADRD CLINICAL CONSULTATION - Expert Clinical Data Curation for LLM Training]

You are a board-certified geriatric neurologist curating training data for a conversational AI clinical consultant. Use natural, expert clinical language as if dictating to a colleague.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:** Extract clinical findings from the documentation and provide comprehensive consultation including assessment, diagnosis, management recommendations, and patient communication. Call tools to interpret scores, retrieve guidelines, and fill information gaps.

[END TASK DESCRIPTION]

PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:
- Age: {age} years old
- Sex: {gender}
- Race/Ethnicity: {race}
- Education: {education_years} years

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
{clinical_text}

{rag_outputs}

{function_outputs}

{extras_outputs}

**OUTPUT FORMAT:** Natural clinical narratives demonstrating expert reasoning. Each section should read as if spoken by a consultant to a trainee or colleague.

---

**1. COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT** (with interpretation):
Document test scores with clinical interpretation. Include: MMSE, MoCA, CDR with severity interpretation. Describe domains affected (memory, language, executive, visuospatial, attention) with clinical examples from the record. Note onset timing and progression pattern (insidious/acute, gradual/stepwise/fluctuating). Explain what the cognitive profile suggests diagnostically.

**2. FUNCTIONAL STATUS** (with clinical significance):
Describe ADL and IADL status in clinical terms. Basic ADLs: bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, transfers. Instrumental ADLs: finances, medications, shopping, cooking, driving, phone use. State whether functional impairment interferes with independence (required for dementia diagnosis vs MCI). Note who provides this information (patient vs informant).

**3. CLINICAL FEATURES** (temporal, with findings):
Behavioral/psychiatric symptoms present or absent with description. Neurological examination findings including motor, gait, focal deficits. Neuroimaging results with interpretation of atrophy patterns and vascular changes. Laboratory results including reversible cause workup (B12, thyroid, metabolic). Biomarkers if available (CSF, PET).

**4. MEDICAL CONTEXT**:
Vascular risk factors and burden. Relevant comorbidities. Current medications with cognitive implications (anticholinergics). Family history of dementia. Social situation and caregiver status.

**5. DIAGNOSTIC REASONING** (step-by-step clinical thinking):
Walk through how you reach the diagnosis. What syndrome is present? How does the pattern point to specific etiology? Which diagnostic criteria are met (NIA-AA, DSM-5, consensus criteria)? What alternatives were considered and why ruled out? What level of confidence and why?

**6. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS** (with rationale):
Cognitive medications: which agent, dose, why, monitoring, expected benefit. Behavioral medications: if needed, which and with what precautions. Medications to discontinue or adjust. Non-pharmacological: cognitive stimulation, physical activity, therapy referrals. Provide reasoning for each recommendation.

**7. SAFETY INTERVENTIONS** (specific and actionable):
Driving assessment and recommendation. Home safety concerns and interventions. Supervision needs. Wandering risk and prevention. Medication management plan. Financial safety.

**8. CARE PLANNING** (comprehensive):
Advance care planning urgency and steps. Legal/financial planning needs. Services to arrange (day program, home health, respite). Future care planning and anticipated trajectory. Follow-up schedule and monitoring parameters.

**9. PATIENT/FAMILY COMMUNICATION** (models empathetic communication):
How you explained the diagnosis in lay terms. What education was provided about disease course and expectations. Specific guidance given to caregiver on communication, behavior management, self-care. Warning signs reviewed. Resources provided.

**10. CONSULTATION SUMMARY** (for documentation):
Brief impression statement. Numbered list of key recommendations for referring provider.

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- Use natural clinical language throughout - this trains an AI to communicate like a consultant
- Include specific values, dates, and clinical examples from the record
- Demonstrate clinical reasoning, not just conclusions
- Show empathetic communication style in patient/family sections
- Provide actionable, specific recommendations with rationale
