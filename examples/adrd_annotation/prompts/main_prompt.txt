[TASK DESCRIPTION]
You are a geriatric neurologist creating comprehensive consultation documentation that will train an AI clinical decision support system. Your task is to analyze this patient's clinical record and generate a complete consultation that demonstrates expert clinical reasoning, evidence-based recommendations, and patient-centered communication.

This annotation serves to create instruction-tuning data for a medical LLM. Generate responses as if you are dictating a consultation note to a colleague while also preparing materials for the patient and family. The output must demonstrate the full scope of expert clinical consultation including assessment, recommendations, care planning, and education.

## COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATION ANNOTATION FRAMEWORK

As a clinical consultant, I need to generate documentation that covers the complete scope of expert consultation. This includes not just diagnosis, but actionable recommendations across multiple domains that demonstrate how an expert clinician thinks and communicates.

### PART 1: CLINICAL DATA EXTRACTION AND ORGANIZATION

First, I systematically extract and organize all clinically relevant information from the record. This structured extraction demonstrates how to identify and prioritize clinical data.

**Cognitive Profile Extraction:**
- Standardized test scores: MMSE, MoCA, CDR scores with interpretation using calculate_mmse_severity, calculate_moca_severity, and calculate_cdr_severity functions
- Domain-specific impairments: memory, language, executive function, visuospatial, attention
- Temporal characteristics: onset, duration, progression pattern
- Symptom examples from the clinical record

**Functional Status Extraction:**
- Basic ADL capabilities using assess_functional_independence
- Instrumental ADL capabilities
- Degree of independence/dependence
- Impact on daily life and safety

**Behavioral and Neuropsychiatric Features:**
- Mood symptoms: depression, anxiety, apathy
- Psychotic symptoms: hallucinations, delusions
- Behavioral changes: agitation, disinhibition, sleep disturbances
- Safety concerns: wandering, aggression

**Medical Comorbidities:**
- Vascular risk factors using calculate_vascular_risk_score
- Other relevant medical conditions
- Current medications with cognitive implications
- Substance use history

**Objective Findings:**
- Neurological examination findings
- Neuroimaging results and interpretation
- Laboratory values including dementia workup
- Biomarkers if available

**Contextual Factors:**
- Family history of dementia or neurological disease
- Social support system
- Living situation and safety
- Caregiver status and burden
- Cultural and linguistic considerations

### PART 2: CLINICAL REASONING NARRATIVE

Here I demonstrate expert clinical thinking - the step-by-step reasoning process that leads to diagnostic conclusions. This is critical for training an AI to reason through complex cases.

**Diagnostic Synthesis:**
Walk through the clinical reasoning:
- What is the primary clinical syndrome (dementia, MCI, delirium, other)?
- Which cognitive domains are affected and what pattern does this suggest?
- How does the temporal course inform the differential?
- What do the functional impacts tell us about severity?
- How do ancillary findings (imaging, labs, biomarkers) fit?

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**
For each diagnosis considered:
- Why was it considered?
- What evidence supports it?
- What evidence argues against it?
- How confident am I in ruling it in or out?

**Diagnostic Formulation:**
- Primary diagnosis with confidence level
- If ADRD: specific subtype and severity stage
- If Non-ADRD: alternative explanation
- Diagnostic certainty (definite, probable, possible) based on established criteria

**Evidence Integration:**
- Which NIA-AA, DSM-5, or consensus criteria are met?
- How do biomarkers support or modify the diagnosis?
- What atypical features complicate the picture?

### PART 3: RECOMMENDATIONS - FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

Based on the current evaluation, what additional testing would clarify the diagnosis or guide management?

**Recommended Additional Cognitive Testing:**
- Would formal neuropsychological testing help characterize deficits?
- Are there specific domains that need more detailed evaluation?
- Should testing be repeated to assess progression?

**Recommended Laboratory Studies:**
- Any gaps in the reversible cause workup (B12, thyroid, metabolic)?
- Would genetic testing be appropriate (early-onset, strong family history)?
- Are there other labs indicated by the presentation?

**Recommended Imaging:**
- Is MRI needed if only CT was done?
- Would PET imaging (FDG, amyloid, tau) change management?
- Would DaTscan help if Lewy body is in the differential?

**Recommended Specialty Consultations:**
- Neuropsychology for detailed cognitive characterization
- Geriatric psychiatry for behavioral symptoms
- Other specialists based on comorbidities

**Recommended Biomarker Studies:**
- Would CSF analysis be informative?
- Are blood-based biomarkers appropriate?

### PART 4: RECOMMENDATIONS - PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

Evidence-based medication recommendations with clinical reasoning.

**Cognitive Symptom Treatment:**
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine): For whom? Which agent? What dose?
- Memantine: When to add? Expected benefits?
- Combination therapy considerations
- Monitoring for efficacy and side effects

**Behavioral Symptom Management:**
- Non-pharmacological approaches FIRST
- If medications needed:
  - Depression/anxiety: which antidepressants are safest?
  - Agitation/aggression: risks of antipsychotics, when justified?
  - Sleep disturbances: melatonin vs other options?
  - Psychosis: careful consideration of benefits vs risks
- Black box warnings and safety monitoring

**Medication Review:**
- Which current medications might be worsening cognition?
- Anticholinergic burden assessment
- Deprescribing opportunities
- Drug interactions to address

**Emerging Treatments:**
- Disease-modifying therapies if applicable (lecanemab, donanemab eligibility)
- Clinical trial eligibility

### PART 5: RECOMMENDATIONS - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

Evidence-based non-drug approaches for patient and caregiver.
