## GUIDELINE-BASED REFINEMENT

Review your initial consultation against authoritative clinical guidelines and enhance accordingly.

### DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION

**Criteria Verification:**
Check your diagnosis against the retrieved guidelines:
- Do we meet NIA-AA criteria for AD?
- Do we meet DSM-5 criteria for major/mild NCD?
- For VaD: NINDS-AIREN criteria?
- For LBD: 2017 Consensus criteria?
- For FTD: Rascovsky criteria?

Document specifically which criteria are met or not met.

**Severity Calibration:**
Verify your severity staging against guideline cutoffs:
- CDR staging alignment
- MMSE severity ranges
- Functional impact thresholds

**Differential Refinement:**
Use guidelines to strengthen your differential:
- Are you properly distinguishing AD from VaD (stepwise vs gradual)?
- Are you correctly applying the 1-year rule for LBD vs PDD?
- Are you considering mixed pathology appropriately?

### RECOMMENDATIONS ENHANCEMENT

**Pharmacological Refinement:**
Compare your medication recommendations to guideline standards:
- Are cholinesterase inhibitor recommendations appropriate per AAD guidelines?
- Is memantine use aligned with evidence?
- Are behavioral medication recommendations following appropriate cautions per Beers criteria?
- Are you recommending deprescribing where indicated?

**Safety Recommendations:**
Ensure comprehensive safety planning per guidelines:
- Driving assessment: Are you following AAN/AAD guidelines?
- Home safety: Comprehensive per OT standards?
- Capacity assessment: Appropriate triggers identified?

**Care Planning Standards:**
Verify comprehensive care planning:
- Advance care planning discussions per AAD recommendations
- Caregiver support per SIGN 168 guidelines
- Palliative care considerations timing

### EDUCATION ENHANCEMENT

**Guideline-Based Education:**
Refine patient/family education using retrieved evidence:
- Prognosis information accuracy
- Treatment expectation calibration
- Warning sign specificity
- Resource recommendations

**Communication Standards:**
Ensure person-centered communication per SIGN 168:
- Respectful terminology
- Appropriate information pacing
- Cultural sensitivity
- Shared decision-making approach

### QUALITY ASSURANCE

**Completeness Check:**
Does your consultation address all AAD Dementia Care Practice Recommendation domains?
- Person-centered care approach
- Assessment and care planning
- Medical management
- Safety concerns
- Caregiver needs

**Evidence Grading:**
For each major recommendation, note the strength of evidence from guidelines (strong recommendation vs suggestion vs expert opinion).

**Gap Identification:**
What recommendations would be stronger with additional patient information? What follow-up is needed to provide complete guideline-concordant care?
