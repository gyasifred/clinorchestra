*** REFINEMENT OBJECTIVES (v1.0.0) ***

**1. VALIDATE MANDATORY PRE-CHECKS**

**PRIMARY COMPLAINT VERIFICATION:**
- CRITICAL: If primary complaint is urological, physical, psychiatric, or behavioral WITHOUT cognitive component → MUST be Non-ADRD
- Examples that should STOP classification as ADRD:
 * "Urinary retention" alone (urological)
 * "Fall risk" alone (physical)
 * "Agitation" alone (behavioral, unless cognitive impairment documented)
 * "Depression" alone (psychiatric, unless cognitive impairment documented)
- Only classify as ADRD if there is EXPLICIT cognitive component (memory loss, confusion, disorientation, cognitive decline)

**CHRONICITY REQUIREMENT:**
- CRITICAL: Cognitive symptoms must be present for ≥6 months for ADRD diagnosis
- If acute onset (<6 months) → Consider delirium, depression, or other acute causes
- Progressive symptoms over ≥6 months → Supports ADRD
- Recent onset without documented progression → CANNOT diagnose ADRD

**COGNITIVE DOMAIN REQUIREMENT:**
- CRITICAL: CANNOT diagnose ADRD without ≥1 specific cognitive domain documented
- Required domains: memory, language, executive function, visuospatial, attention
- Generic "confusion" or "altered mental status" without domain specificity → INSUFFICIENT
- Must have explicit domain impairment (e.g., "short-term memory loss", "word-finding difficulty")

**2. VALIDATE FUNCTIONAL DEFINITIONS (v1.0.0)**

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION: "Difficulty" vs "Dependence"**

"Difficulty" with IADLs = Takes longer, uses compensatory strategies, but INDEPENDENT
- Examples: "Takes longer to balance checkbook", "Uses lists to remember medications"
- Interpretation: Suggests MCI (preserved independence)
- Classification: Non-ADRD (if other criteria met)

"Dependence" in IADLs = Requires regular assistance from others
- Examples: "Wife manages all finances", "Daughter gives medications", "Cannot cook safely"
- Interpretation: Indicates dementia (lost independence)
- Classification: ADRD (if other criteria met)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If classified as ADRD but only "difficulty" documented → Re-evaluate, may be MCI (Non-ADRD)
- If classified as MCI but "dependence" documented → Re-evaluate, likely dementia (ADRD)
- If functional status unclear → Request clarification, note limitation in confidence

**3. VALIDATE CDR 0.5 CLASSIFICATION (v1.0.0)**

**CRITICAL CDR 0.5 RULE:**

CDR 0.5 is AMBIGUOUS - can be MCI OR very mild dementia depending on functional status:

**IF CDR 0.5 + Functionally independent in IADLs:**
- Classification: Non-ADRD (MCI)
- Rationale: Preserved independence despite mild cognitive impairment
- Requires: No IADL dependence documented

**IF CDR 0.5 + IADL dependence present:**
- Classification: ADRD (Very mild dementia)
- Rationale: Functional decline indicates dementia threshold crossed
- Requires: Clear IADL dependence (not just difficulty)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If CDR 0.5 classified as ADRD → Verify IADL dependence documented
- If CDR 0.5 classified as Non-ADRD → Verify functional independence documented
- If CDR 0.5 with unclear functional status → CANNOT make confident classification, note limitation

**4. VALIDATE VASCULAR DEMENTIA CRITERIA (v1.0.0)**

**NINDS-AIREN Criteria - ALL required:**
1. Temporal relationship with stroke/TIA (onset within 3 months)
2. Stepwise progression or fluctuating course
3. Focal neurological signs on exam
4. Significant cerebrovascular disease on imaging (CT/MRI)

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- CRITICAL: Vascular risk factors alone (HTN, DM, smoking) do NOT diagnose vascular dementia
- If classified as vascular dementia → Verify ALL 4 NINDS-AIREN criteria met
- If only vascular risk factors present without stroke/imaging → Reclassify (likely AD or unspecified)
- If mixed presentation (vascular + neurodegenerative) → Consider mixed dementia

**COMMON ERRORS TO FIX:**
- "Patient has HTN and diabetes, classified as vascular dementia" → INCORRECT, need stroke + imaging
- "Risk factors suggest vascular dementia" → INCORRECT, need temporal relationship with stroke
- Correct: "Stroke 2 months ago, stepwise decline, MRI shows multiple infarcts, focal signs → Vascular dementia"

**5. VALIDATE SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE DECLINE**

**DSM-5 Major NCD Requirement:** Significant cognitive decline from previous level

**Defined as ≥1 of:**
- ≥3 point MMSE decline from previous baseline
- ≥2 point MoCA decline from previous baseline
- Clear functional decline (IADL/ADL impairment progression)
- Progressive worsening over ≥6 months documented

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If MMSE/MoCA scores static or improved → Questionable progressive decline
- If no baseline scores available → Cannot quantify decline, rely on functional/clinical progression
- If acute decline over days/weeks → Consider delirium, not ADRD

**6. VALIDATE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CRITERIA**

**NIA-AA Criteria for Probable AD:**
- Gradual onset (months to years, not sudden)
- Clear history of cognitive worsening
- Amnestic presentation (memory-predominant) OR non-amnestic (language/visuospatial/executive)
- No evidence of other neurological, medical, or psychiatric causes

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If sudden onset → NOT probable AD, consider vascular or other causes
- If non-progressive or fluctuating → NOT typical AD, consider DLB or vascular
- If prominent early behavioral changes → Consider FTD
- If prominent early visual hallucinations → Consider DLB

**7. VALIDATE LEWY BODY DEMENTIA CRITERIA (2017 Consensus)**

**Probable DLB requires ≥2 core features:**
1. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness
2. Recurrent visual hallucinations (well-formed, detailed)
3. REM sleep behavior disorder
4. One or more features of parkinsonism (with >1 year rule)

**1-Year Rule:** Parkinsonism onset >1 year before cognitive symptoms → Parkinson's Disease Dementia, NOT DLB

**VALIDATION CHECKS:**
- If classified as DLB → Verify ≥2 core features documented
- If only 1 core feature → Reclassify as possible DLB or other diagnosis
- Check parkinsonism timing (before or after cognitive symptoms)

**8. VALIDATE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

**Non-ADRD Classifications:**

**MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment):**
- Cognitive impairment YES (test scores, subjective complaints)
- Functional independence YES (IADLs preserved, no dependence)
- Dementia criteria NOT met
- If IADL dependence present → NOT MCI, reclassify as dementia

**Depression with Cognitive Symptoms:**
- Prominent mood symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood)
- Cognitive symptoms proportional to mood severity
- Often reversible with depression treatment
- If progressive cognitive decline despite mood treatment → Consider dementia

**Delirium:**
- Acute onset (hours to days)
- Fluctuating consciousness and attention
- Identifiable medical cause (infection, medication, metabolic)
- If symptoms persist >6 months → NOT pure delirium, consider underlying dementia

**9. CORRECT COMMON MISCLASSIFICATIONS**

**ERROR #1: Classifying urological/physical complaints as ADRD**
- Primary complaint: "Urinary retention", "Fall risk", "Weakness"
- No cognitive component documented
- FIX: Reclassify as Non-ADRD, note primary complaint non-cognitive

**ERROR #2: Diagnosing ADRD without functional decline**
- Cognitive impairment: Yes (MMSE 24, MoCA 22)
- Functional status: "Fully independent in all IADLs"
- FIX: Reclassify as Non-ADRD (MCI), not dementia

**ERROR #3: CDR 0.5 automatically classified as dementia**
- CDR: 0.5
- Functional status: "Independent in finances, driving, medications, cooking"
- FIX: Reclassify as Non-ADRD (MCI), preserved independence

**ERROR #4: Vascular risk factors → vascular dementia**
- Risk factors: HTN, DM, smoking
- No stroke history, no imaging showing cerebrovascular disease
- FIX: Reclassify (likely AD or unspecified), risk factors alone insufficient

**ERROR #5: Acute onset (<6 months) classified as ADRD**
- Symptom duration: 2 months
- No documented progression
- FIX: Reclassify as Non-ADRD, consider delirium or acute reversible cause

**ERROR #6: No specific cognitive domain documented**
- Description: "Confusion", "Altered mental status"
- No memory, language, executive, visuospatial, or attention deficits specified
- FIX: Reclassify as Non-ADRD or note insufficient documentation for ADRD diagnosis

**10. ENHANCE MISSING ELEMENTS**

**ADD IF MISSING:**
- Specific diagnostic criteria met (list which NIA-AA, NINDS-AIREN, DSM-5 criteria satisfied)
- Functional status clarification (difficulty vs dependence)
- Cognitive domain specificity (which domains impaired)

7. **Criteria Documentation**: Specific NIA-AA, NINDS-AIREN, DSM-5, DLB criteria met
8. **Differential Reasoning**: Why this diagnosis vs alternatives
9. **Confidence Calibration**: Based on documentation quality and criteria clarity
10. **Missing Data Identification**: What additional information would strengthen diagnosis

*** CRITICAL REMINDERS (v1.0.0) ***

1. **DO NOT** classify as ADRD if primary complaint is urological/physical/psychiatric without cognitive component
2. **DO NOT** classify as ADRD if symptoms <6 months duration (chronicity requirement)
3. **DO NOT** classify as ADRD without ≥1 specific cognitive domain documented
4. **DO NOT** classify as dementia without functional DEPENDENCE (difficulty alone = MCI)
5. **DO NOT** classify CDR 0.5 as dementia if IADLs are independent (preserved independence = MCI)
6. **DO NOT** diagnose vascular dementia based on risk factors alone (need stroke + imaging + stepwise + focal signs)
7. **DO NOT** diagnose AD with sudden onset (must be gradual over months/years)
8. **DO NOT** diagnose DLB without ≥2 core features (fluctuations, hallucinations, RBD, parkinsonism)
9. **DO NOT** confuse delirium (acute, hours-days) with dementia (chronic, ≥6 months)
10. **DO** apply functional definitions (difficulty = MCI, dependence = dementia)
11. **DO** verify chronicity (≥6 months for ADRD)
12. **DO** document specific cognitive domains impaired
13. **DO** distinguish primary complaint from secondary findings
14. **DO** validate all diagnostic criteria from guidelines before confirming classification
15. **DO** calibrate confidence to documentation quality and criteria clarity

**REFINEMENT PHILOSOPHY:**
- **Prioritize specificity over sensitivity** - Better to classify as Non-ADRD with limitations noted than to over-diagnose ADRD without proper criteria
- **Enforce mandatory pre-checks** - Primary complaint, chronicity, cognitive domains are non-negotiable
- **Apply functional definitions rigorously** - Difficulty ≠ dependence, MCI ≠ dementia
- **Validate against retrieved guidelines** - Ensure NIA-AA, NINDS-AIREN, DSM-5, DLB criteria properly applied
- **Document reasoning transparently** - Explain why this classification vs alternatives

Return refined classification with guideline-validated criteria and appropriate confidence based on v1.0.0 safeguards.
