[TASK DESCRIPTION]
You've already given me your initial assessment of this patient. Now I've pulled up the relevant clinical guidelines and diagnostic criteria. Let's refine your thinking - check your work against the established standards, see if anything needs adjustment, and strengthen your reasoning with evidence-based support.

This is like the second look you'd take before finalizing a consultation note - making sure everything holds up against the published criteria.

Alright, let's review this case against the guidelines.

CHECKING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

First, I want to make sure we're applying the right diagnostic standards properly.

**For an ADRD diagnosis, let's verify:**

If I called this Alzheimer's disease, do we meet NIA-AA criteria?
- Dementia present: Cognitive symptoms that interfere with daily activities? Check.
- Insidious onset over months to years?
- Clear history of worsening cognition by report or observation?
- Amnestic or non-amnestic presentation fitting the pattern?

The guidelines specify what "probable AD" versus "possible AD" means - probable requires no features suggesting alternative diagnosis, while possible allows for some atypical features.

If I called this vascular dementia, do we meet the criteria for "probable" versus "possible" VaD? Is there a clear temporal relationship between stroke and cognitive decline, or imaging evidence of significant cerebrovascular disease?

If Lewy body dementia, are we meeting the 2017 consensus criteria? Two or more core features for "probable" - fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, RBD, parkinsonism. The guidelines also specify supportive features like neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, and characteristic biomarkers.

If frontotemporal dementia, do we meet the Rascovsky or other FTD criteria? Early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behaviors, hyperorality - or the language variant features?

**For a Non-ADRD classification, let's verify:**

If I called this MCI, are we meeting the criteria properly? Objective cognitive impairment (typically 1-1.5 SD below norms), concern by patient or informant, but - critically - preserved independence in functional abilities. The guidelines are clear that dementia requires functional impairment while MCI does not.

If I'm attributing this to depression, do the features match DSM-5 major depressive disorder criteria? Are the cognitive symptoms proportion to the affective symptoms? Would treatment of depression be expected to improve cognition?

If delirium, is this truly acute onset with fluctuating consciousness and inattention? Guidelines specify delirium as an exclusion - you can't diagnose dementia during an acute confusional state.

REFINING THE SEVERITY STAGING

The guidelines provide specific cutoffs. Let me make sure my severity assessment is calibrated correctly:

For CDR staging:
- CDR 0.5: Questionable impairment/very mild
- CDR 1: Mild dementia
- CDR 2: Moderate dementia
- CDR 3: Severe dementia

For MMSE-based staging (with caveats about education):
- 24-30: Normal to mild impairment
- 18-23: Mild dementia
- 10-17: Moderate dementia
- 0-9: Severe dementia

Do my severity ratings match what the guidelines say these scores represent?

STRENGTHENING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Looking at the guidelines, am I properly distinguishing between the ADRD subtypes?

**AD vs VaD**: The guidelines emphasize that pure vascular dementia should show stepwise progression, temporal relationship with cerebrovascular events, and prominent executive dysfunction with relative memory sparing early. Mixed pathology (AD + vascular) is actually most common - am I accounting for that possibility?

**AD vs LBD**: The "1-year rule" in guidelines - if parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year, it's PD dementia, not LBD. Core features of LBD should be present early and prominently. Am I weighting these features correctly?

**AD vs FTD**: Guidelines emphasize that memory is relatively preserved early in FTD while behavior and/or language are prominently affected. Age of onset matters too - FTD typically presents younger than AD.

CONSIDERING THE BIOMARKER EVIDENCE

If biomarkers are available, let me check my interpretation against guideline cutoffs:

**CSF biomarkers**: The A/T/N framework from guidelines:
- A+ (amyloid positive): Low Aβ42 or positive amyloid PET
- T+ (tau positive): High phospho-tau
- N+ (neurodegeneration positive): High total tau, hypometabolism on FDG-PET, or atrophy on MRI

An A+/T+/N+ profile strongly supports AD pathology. But remember - pathology doesn't equal clinical syndrome, especially in older adults with mixed pathology.

**Imaging interpretation**: Am I using guideline standards for interpreting atrophy patterns and white matter changes? The guidelines have specific criteria for what constitutes "significant" vascular burden versus age-related changes.

ADJUSTING MY CONFIDENCE

The guidelines help me calibrate confidence:

**High confidence** when:
- All core diagnostic criteria clearly met
- Biomarkers (if available) support the diagnosis
- No features suggesting alternative diagnosis
- Typical presentation and course

**Moderate confidence** when:
- Core clinical criteria met but limited biomarker support
- Some atypical features but overall picture still fits
- Can't fully exclude one alternative

**Low confidence** when:
- Atypical presentation
- Conflicting evidence
- Multiple diagnoses plausible
- Critical information missing

MAKING REFINEMENTS

Based on this guideline review, I'll refine my assessment:

1. **Classification**: Keep or adjust? Most refinements should be about precision, not flipping the diagnosis entirely. But if the guidelines reveal I misapplied criteria, I'll correct it.

2. **Subtype specificity**: Can I be more precise about which ADRD subtype based on guideline criteria? Should I consider mixed pathology?

3. **Severity staging**: Does my staging align with guideline cutoffs?

4. **Confidence justification**: Can I cite specific guideline criteria that are met or unmet?

5. **Gaps identified**: What additional testing do guidelines suggest would strengthen or change the diagnosis?

Please review your initial assessment against these guidelines. Refine your classification where needed, strengthen your reasoning with guideline-based evidence, and adjust your confidence level appropriately. The goal is a classification that would hold up to peer review - grounded in established diagnostic criteria and clearly reasoned.
