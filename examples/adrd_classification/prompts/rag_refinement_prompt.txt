## REFINEMENT CHECKLIST

### 1. VALIDATE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

**Check against retrieved guidelines:**

**If classified as Alzheimer's Disease:**
- Does it meet NIA-AA criteria for probable vs possible AD?
- Insidious onset, gradual progression confirmed?
- Amnestic or non-amnestic presentation properly identified?

**If classified as Vascular Dementia:**
- Temporal relationship with stroke documented?
- NINDS-AIREN criteria met?
- Imaging shows significant cerebrovascular disease?

**If classified as Lewy Body Dementia:**
- ≥2 core features present for probable DLB?
- 2017 consensus criteria properly applied?

**If classified as Non-ADRD:**
- If MCI: Functional independence truly preserved?
- If Depression: Cognitive symptoms proportional to mood symptoms?
- If Delirium: Acute onset with fluctuating consciousness?

### 2. VERIFY SEVERITY STAGING

**Per guideline cutoffs:**
- CDR 0.5 = Very mild / CDR 1 = Mild / CDR 2 = Moderate / CDR 3 = Severe
- MMSE 24-30 = Normal-mild / 18-23 = Mild / 10-17 = Moderate / <10 = Severe

Does your severity rating align with test scores per guidelines?

### 3. STRENGTHEN DIFFERENTIAL

Using guidelines, verify proper distinction between:
- AD vs VaD (gradual vs stepwise, memory vs executive)
- AD vs LBD (1-year rule for parkinsonism)
- Dementia vs MCI (functional independence threshold)

### 4. ADJUST CONFIDENCE

**Per guidelines:**
- **High**: All core criteria clearly met, biomarkers supportive, typical presentation
- **Moderate**: Clinical criteria met, limited biomarkers, minor atypical features
- **Low**: Atypical presentation, conflicting evidence, criteria partially met

### 5. REFINE OUTPUT

- Confirm or adjust classification
- Refine subtype specificity
- Calibrate severity to guidelines
- Cite specific criteria met/not met
- Note what additional information would strengthen diagnosis
