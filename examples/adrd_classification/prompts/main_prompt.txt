## CLASSIFICATION TASK

### STEP 0: MANDATORY PRE-CHECKS (v1.0.0)

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, VERIFY:**

1. **PRIMARY COMPLAINT VERIFICATION:**
 - Is the primary complaint cognitive in nature (memory loss, confusion, dementia, cognitive decline)?
 - If primary complaint is urological, physical, psychiatric, or behavioral WITHOUT cognitive component → STOP → Classify as Non-ADRD
 - Examples of NON-COGNITIVE primary complaints: urinary incontinence, UTI, syncope, falls, agitation alone, depression alone
 - Only proceed if cognitive complaint is present or cognitive symptoms are clearly documented

2. **CHRONICITY REQUIREMENT:**
 - Cognitive symptoms must be present for ≥6 months for ADRD diagnosis
 - Acute onset (<2 weeks) → Consider delirium → Classify as Non-ADRD
 - Subacute (weeks to months) → Rule out reversible causes first
 - Document symptom duration if available

### STEP 1: EXTRACT CLINICAL DATA

**Cognitive Assessment:**
- Test scores: MMSE, MoCA, CDR (use severity functions for interpretation)
- **MANDATORY:** Cognitive domains affected: memory, language, executive, visuospatial, attention
 - **CANNOT diagnose ADRD without ≥1 specific cognitive domain documented**
 - If no domains identified → Classify as Non-ADRD with note "No specific cognitive domains documented"
- Onset type and progression pattern
- Duration of symptoms (required for chronicity check)

**Functional Status:**
- Basic ADL status (bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, transferring)
- Instrumental IADL status (finances, medications, shopping, cooking, driving)

**CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL DEFINITIONS (v1.0.0):**
- **"Difficulty" with IADLs** = Takes longer, uses compensatory strategies, occasional errors → Often MCI
- **"Dependence" in IADLs** = Requires regular assistance, cannot complete safely, needs supervision → Dementia threshold
- **Dementia REQUIRES:** Dependence in ≥1 IADL OR any ADL impairment
- **ADL impairment** = Always indicates moderate-severe dementia

**Does impairment interfere with independence?**
- IF functionally independent in IADLs → Does NOT meet dementia criteria (may be normal or MCI)
- IF IADL dependence present → Meets functional criteria for dementia
- IF ADL dependence → Meets criteria for moderate-severe dementia

**Clinical Features:**
- Behavioral/psychiatric symptoms present
- Neurological examination findings
- Neuroimaging results and patterns
- Laboratory workup results
- Biomarkers if available

**Medical Context:**
- Vascular risk factors (use vascular risk score function)
- Reversible causes ruled out (B12, thyroid, medication, depression)
- Family history

### STEP 2: APPLY DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

**For Dementia Diagnosis (DSM-5 Major NCD):**
- **Significant cognitive decline from previous level:**
 - Defined as: ≥3 point MMSE decline from baseline, OR
 - ≥2 point MoCA decline from baseline, OR
 - Clear functional decline from previous level, OR
 - Progressive worsening over ≥6 months
- **Interferes with independence in everyday activities** (REQUIRED - see definitions above)
- Not occurring during delirium
- Not explained by another mental disorder

**For ADRD Subtypes:**

**Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AA):**
- Insidious onset, gradual progression
- Amnestic or non-amnestic presentation
- **No evidence of alternative cause**
 - **MUST rule out:** Depression, B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, medication effects, normal aging
 - **Do NOT diagnose AD based solely on "insidious onset + gradual progression"**
 - Requires comprehensive differential diagnosis

**Vascular Dementia (NINDS-AIREN):**
- **ALL of the following REQUIRED:**
 - (1) Temporal relationship with stroke or TIA
 - (2) Stepwise progression or fluctuating decline
 - (3) Focal neurological signs
 - (4) **Significant cerebrovascular disease on imaging** (infarcts, white matter disease)
- **Vascular risk factors alone do NOT diagnose vascular dementia**
- If imaging not available or no stroke history → Cannot diagnose vascular dementia

**Lewy Body Dementia (2017 Consensus):**
- ≥2 core features: fluctuations, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, parkinsonism
- Supportive: neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction

**Frontotemporal Dementia (Rascovsky):**
- ≥3 of: disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behavior, hyperorality, executive deficits with relative memory sparing

### STEP 3: CONSIDER DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**MANDATORY DIFFERENTIAL CHECKS:**

**Non-ADRD conditions that MUST be considered:**
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):** Cognitive impairment WITHOUT functional dependence (preserved independence)
 - **CDR 0.5 + fully independent IADLs = MCI (Non-ADRD)**
 - **CDR 0.5 + IADL dependence = Very mild dementia (ADRD)**
- **Depression/Pseudodementia:** Check for depressive symptoms, response to treatment
- **Delirium:** Acute onset (<2 weeks), fluctuating course, inattention
- **Medication-induced:** Anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids
- **Metabolic causes:** B12 deficiency (<200 pg/mL), hypothyroidism (TSH >10), hypercalcemia
- **Normal aging:** Mild forgetfulness without functional impact
- **Normal cognitive function:** No objective impairment

**If reversible cause not ruled out → CANNOT diagnose ADRD**

### STEP 4: DETERMINE CLASSIFICATION

**ADRD** if:
- Meets criteria for dementia (cognitive decline + functional DEPENDENCE)
- Pattern consistent with neurodegenerative or vascular etiology
- Reversible causes excluded or adequately ruled out
- **At least 1 cognitive domain specifically identified**
- Symptoms present ≥6 months (chronicity)

**Non-ADRD** if:
- Does not meet dementia criteria (e.g., preserved independence = MCI)
- Better explained by psychiatric, metabolic, or medication cause
- Acute/reversible condition (e.g., delirium, UTI with confusion)
- Primary complaint is non-cognitive (urological, physical, behavioral only)
- No specific cognitive domains documented
- Symptoms <6 months without clear progressive course

**CRITICAL CDR 0.5 RULE (v1.0.0):**
- CDR 0.5 is AMBIGUOUS
- **IF CDR 0.5 + functionally independent in IADLs → Classify as Non-ADRD (MCI)**
- **IF CDR 0.5 + IADL dependence present → Classify as ADRD (very mild dementia)**
- DO NOT automatically classify CDR 0.5 as dementia

### STEP 5: ASSIGN CONFIDENCE

**High:** Core criteria clearly met, supporting biomarkers/imaging, typical presentation, comprehensive documentation, ≥6 month duration

**Moderate:** Clinical criteria met, limited biomarker data, some atypical features, adequate documentation, reversible causes considered

**Low:** Atypical presentation, conflicting data, key information missing, insufficient documentation, chronicity unclear, reversible causes not ruled out, symptom duration <6 months

**MANDATORY LOW CONFIDENCE if:**
- No formal cognitive testing (MMSE/MoCA/CDR) documented
- Primary complaint is non-cognitive
- Chronicity <6 months
- Reversible causes not addressed
- No specific cognitive domains identified

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Provide structured classification with:

1. **Primary complaint verification:** State whether primary complaint is cognitive
2. **Chronicity assessment:** Document symptom duration if available
3. **Systematic data extraction** from clinical record
4. **Cognitive domains identified:** List specific domains (REQUIRED)
5. **Functional assessment:** State whether "difficulty" or "dependence" present
6. **Classification decision**: ADRD or Non-ADRD
7. **Specific diagnosis**: Subtype (AD, VaD, LBD, FTD, Mixed) or alternative (MCI, Depression, etc.)
8. **Severity** if ADRD: Mild, Moderate, Severe (based on functional impairment)
9. **Confidence level**: High, Moderate, Low
10. **Supporting evidence**: Key findings that support classification
11. **Differential diagnosis**: Alternatives considered and why ruled out/in
12. **Criteria application**: Which diagnostic criteria are met

## CRITICAL REMINDERS (v1.0.0)

1. **DO NOT** diagnose ADRD without ≥1 specific cognitive domain documented
2. **DO NOT** diagnose dementia without functional DEPENDENCE (difficulty ≠ dependence)
3. **DO NOT** confuse MCI (preserved independence) with dementia
4. **DO NOT** classify CDR 0.5 as dementia if IADLs are independent
5. **DO NOT** diagnose vascular dementia based on risk factors alone (requires imaging + stroke + stepwise decline)
6. **DO NOT** classify urological/physical/behavioral complaints without cognitive component as ADRD
7. **DO NOT** diagnose ADRD if symptoms <6 months without clear progressive dementia course
8. **DO NOT** ignore reversible causes (B12, thyroid, depression, medications)
9. **DO NOT** diagnose AD based solely on "insidious onset, gradual progression" without ruling out alternatives
10. **DO** distinguish "difficulty" (MCI) from "dependence" (dementia) in functional assessment
