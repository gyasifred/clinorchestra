## CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT RESOURCES

**Use these tools for evidence-based classification:**

### Functions:
- **calculate_mmse_severity(mmse_score)** - Interpret MMSE score
- **calculate_moca_severity(moca_score)** - Interpret MoCA score
- **calculate_cdr_severity(cdr_score)** - Interpret CDR score and dementia stage
- **calculate_vascular_risk_score(risk_factors)** - Calculate vascular burden
- **assess_functional_independence(adl_status, iadl_status)** - Evaluate functional status

### Extras: Diagnostic criteria, cognitive terms, dementia types, differential diagnoses

### RAG Resources: NIA-AA criteria, DSM-5 criteria, consensus criteria for LBD/FTD/VaD

## CLASSIFICATION TASK

### STEP 1: EXTRACT CLINICAL DATA

**Cognitive Assessment:**
- Test scores: MMSE, MoCA, CDR (use severity functions for interpretation)
- Cognitive domains affected: memory, language, executive, visuospatial, attention
- Onset type and progression pattern
- Duration of symptoms

**Functional Status:**
- Basic ADL status (bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, transferring)
- Instrumental ADL status (finances, medications, shopping, cooking, driving)
- Does impairment interfere with independence? (required for dementia diagnosis)

**Clinical Features:**
- Behavioral/psychiatric symptoms present
- Neurological examination findings
- Neuroimaging results and patterns
- Laboratory workup results
- Biomarkers if available

**Medical Context:**
- Vascular risk factors (use vascular risk score function)
- Reversible causes ruled out
- Family history

### STEP 2: APPLY DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

**For Dementia Diagnosis (DSM-5 Major NCD):**
- Significant cognitive decline from previous level
- Interferes with independence in everyday activities
- Not occurring during delirium
- Not explained by another mental disorder

**For ADRD Subtypes:**

**Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AA):**
- Insidious onset, gradual progression
- Amnestic or non-amnestic presentation
- No evidence of alternative cause

**Vascular Dementia (NINDS-AIREN):**
- Temporal relationship with stroke
- Stepwise progression
- Focal neurological signs
- Significant cerebrovascular disease on imaging

**Lewy Body Dementia (2017 Consensus):**
- ≥2 core features: fluctuations, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, parkinsonism
- Supportive: neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction

**Frontotemporal Dementia (Rascovsky):**
- ≥3 of: disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behavior, hyperorality, executive deficits with relative memory sparing

### STEP 3: CONSIDER DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Non-ADRD conditions to consider:**
- Mild Cognitive Impairment (preserved independence)
- Depression/Pseudodementia
- Delirium
- Medication-induced cognitive impairment
- Metabolic causes (B12, thyroid)
- Normal aging

### STEP 4: DETERMINE CLASSIFICATION

**ADRD** if:
- Meets criteria for dementia (cognitive decline + functional impairment)
- Pattern consistent with neurodegenerative or vascular etiology
- Reversible causes excluded

**Non-ADRD** if:
- Does not meet dementia criteria (e.g., preserved independence = MCI)
- Better explained by psychiatric, metabolic, or medication cause
- Acute/reversible condition

### STEP 5: ASSIGN CONFIDENCE

**High:** Core criteria clearly met, supporting biomarkers/imaging, typical presentation
**Moderate:** Clinical criteria met, limited biomarker data, some atypical features
**Low:** Atypical presentation, conflicting data, key information missing

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Provide structured classification with:

1. **Systematic data extraction** from clinical record
2. **Classification decision**: ADRD or Non-ADRD
3. **Specific diagnosis**: Subtype (AD, VaD, LBD, FTD, Mixed) or alternative (MCI, Depression, etc.)
4. **Severity** if ADRD: Mild, Moderate, Severe
5. **Confidence level**: High, Moderate, Low
6. **Supporting evidence**: Key findings that support classification
7. **Differential diagnosis**: Alternatives considered and why ruled out
8. **Criteria application**: Which diagnostic criteria are met
