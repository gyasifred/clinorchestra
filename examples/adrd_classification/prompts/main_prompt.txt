**TOOL CALLING CAPABILITY:** You have access to clinical decision support tools that can calculate score interpretations, retrieve diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines, and fill information gaps. Use these tools as needed to support evidence-based classification.

## CLASSIFICATION TASK

### STEP 1: EXTRACT CLINICAL DATA

**Cognitive Assessment:**
- Test scores: MMSE, MoCA, CDR (use severity functions for interpretation)
- Cognitive domains affected: memory, language, executive, visuospatial, attention
- Onset type and progression pattern
- Duration of symptoms

**Functional Status:**
- Basic ADL status (bathing, dressing, toileting, feeding, transferring)
- Instrumental ADL status (finances, medications, shopping, cooking, driving)
- Does impairment interfere with independence? (required for dementia diagnosis)

**Clinical Features:**
- Behavioral/psychiatric symptoms present
- Neurological examination findings
- Neuroimaging results and patterns
- Laboratory workup results
- Biomarkers if available

**Medical Context:**
- Vascular risk factors (use vascular risk score function)
- Reversible causes ruled out
- Family history

### STEP 2: APPLY DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

**For Dementia Diagnosis (DSM-5 Major NCD):**
- Significant cognitive decline from previous level
- Interferes with independence in everyday activities
- Not occurring during delirium
- Not explained by another mental disorder

**For ADRD Subtypes:**

**Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AA):**
- Insidious onset, gradual progression
- Amnestic or non-amnestic presentation
- No evidence of alternative cause

**Vascular Dementia (NINDS-AIREN):**
- Temporal relationship with stroke
- Stepwise progression
- Focal neurological signs
- Significant cerebrovascular disease on imaging

**Lewy Body Dementia (2017 Consensus):**
- ≥2 core features: fluctuations, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, parkinsonism
- Supportive: neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction

**Frontotemporal Dementia (Rascovsky):**
- ≥3 of: disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behavior, hyperorality, executive deficits with relative memory sparing

### STEP 3: CONSIDER DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Non-ADRD conditions to consider:**
- Mild Cognitive Impairment (preserved independence)
- Depression/Pseudodementia
- Delirium
- Medication-induced cognitive impairment
- Metabolic causes (B12, thyroid)
- Normal aging

### STEP 4: DETERMINE CLASSIFICATION

**ADRD** if:
- Meets criteria for dementia (cognitive decline + functional impairment)
- Pattern consistent with neurodegenerative or vascular etiology
- Reversible causes excluded

**Non-ADRD** if:
- Does not meet dementia criteria (e.g., preserved independence = MCI)
- Better explained by psychiatric, metabolic, or medication cause
- Acute/reversible condition

### STEP 5: ASSIGN CONFIDENCE

**High:** Core criteria clearly met, supporting biomarkers/imaging, typical presentation
**Moderate:** Clinical criteria met, limited biomarker data, some atypical features
**Low:** Atypical presentation, conflicting data, key information missing

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Provide structured classification with:

1. **Systematic data extraction** from clinical record
2. **Classification decision**: ADRD or Non-ADRD
3. **Specific diagnosis**: Subtype (AD, VaD, LBD, FTD, Mixed) or alternative (MCI, Depression, etc.)
4. **Severity** if ADRD: Mild, Moderate, Severe
5. **Confidence level**: High, Moderate, Low
6. **Supporting evidence**: Key findings that support classification
7. **Differential diagnosis**: Alternatives considered and why ruled out
8. **Criteria application**: Which diagnostic criteria are met
