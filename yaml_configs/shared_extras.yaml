    \ 24h if received tPA, immediately if not)\n   - Statin (high-intensity)\n   -\
    \ DVT prophylaxis\n   - Swallow evaluation before PO\n   - Monitor for complications\
    \ (hemorrhagic transformation, edema)\n\nSECONDARY PREVENTION:\n- Antiplatelet:\
    \ Aspirin 81mg OR clopidogrel 75mg daily\n- Dual antiplatelet (aspirin + clopidogrel)\
    \ × 21-90 days if minor stroke/TIA\n- Anticoagulation if cardioembolic (AFib)\n\
