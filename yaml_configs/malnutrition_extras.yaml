    \ MI (plaque rupture, erosion, dissection)\n- Type 2: MI secondary to ischemic\
    \ imbalance (supply-demand mismatch)\n- Type 3: Cardiac death with suspected MI\
    \ (sudden death before biomarkers obtained)\n- Type 4a: MI related to PCI\n- Type\
    \ 4b: MI related to stent thrombosis\n- Type 5: MI related to CABG\n\nSTEMI vs\

    \ Troponin elevation WITHOUT ST elevation\n\nBIOMARKERS:\n- Troponin I/T: Rise\
    \ detectable 2-4h, peak 12-48h, elevated 4-14 days\n- High-sensitivity troponin:\
    \ Earlier detection (0h, 1h, 3h protocols)\n\nTREATMENT:\n- STEMI: Immediate reperfusion\
    \ (PCI <90min or thrombolysis <30min)\n- NSTEMI: Risk stratification (TIMI/GRACE\

    Always Document:

    1. The actual z-score value (with sign)

    2. The corresponding percentile

    3. The measurement type (weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMI-for-age, weight-for-height)

    4. Date of measurement

    5. Comparison to previous measurements (trend)


    Correct Documentation Examples:

    ✓ "Weight 12.5 kg, weight-for-age z-score -1.88 (3rd percentile)"

    ✓ "BMI 14.8 kg/m², BMI-for-age z-score -2.1 (2nd percentile), indicating moderate
    acute malnutrition"

    ✓ "Height 92 cm, height-for-age z-score -0.67 (25th percentile), within normal
    range"


    Incorrect Documentation (DO NOT USE):

    ✗ "3rd percentile, z-score +1.88" (wrong sign - should be negative)

    ✗ "Below average growth, z-score positive" (contradiction)

    ✗ "Z-score -2, 97th percentile" (inconsistent - -2 ≈ 2nd percentile, not 97th)


    Trend Documentation:

    - "Weight z-score declined from -1.2 (6 months ago) to -2.1 (today), indicating
    progression of malnutrition"

    - "Height-for-age z-score improved from -2.5 to -1.8 over 3 months with nutritional
    intervention"

    \   - PCAs for severe pain\n\n3. NUTRITION:\n   - Early enteral nutrition (within\
