    CLINICAL JUDGMENT PRINCIPLES FOR ADRD DIAGNOSIS

    OVERARCHING PRINCIPLE:
    Diagnosis requires integration of ALL available clinical information using expert judgment.

    KEY REMINDERS:
    1. Screening test thresholds are NOT diagnostic cutoffs
    2. Missing documentation does NOT equal absence of impairment
    3. Functional impairment distinguishes MCI from dementia
    4. Multiple pathologies are common in elderly (>50% over age 85)
    5. Psychiatric symptoms can BE early ADRD manifestation
    6. Rule out delirium and non-ADRD causes first
    7. Clinical context determines significance of test scores
    8. No single test or criterion determines diagnosis

    These principles must guide interpretation of all assessment data.

    NIA-AA MCI (MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT) DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
    Source: AA 2024 Guidelines Table 1

    MCI is diagnosed when:

    1. COGNITIVE CONCERN
       - Concern regarding change in cognition
       - In comparison with person's previous level
       - Reported by patient, informant, or clinician

    2. OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE
       - Objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains
       - Typically includes memory
       - May include other domains

    3. PRESERVATION OF INDEPENDENCE (KEY DISTINCTION)
       - Preservation of independence in functional abilities
       - Patient may be slower, less efficient, or make more errors
       - BUT maintains independence without assistance

    4. NOT DEMENTED
       - Does not meet criteria for dementia

    CRITICAL DISTINCTION FROM DEMENTIA:
    - MCI: Functional independence PRESERVED
    - Dementia: Functional independence IMPAIRED

    This distinction is THE key differentiator between MCI and dementia.
    IADLs (instrumental activities) typically affected first:
    - Managing finances
    - Managing medications
    - Using transportation
    - Shopping

    NON-ADRD CAUSES TO EXCLUDE BEFORE DIAGNOSING ADRD

    MUST RULE OUT THESE CONDITIONS FIRST:

    =====================================
    1. DELIRIUM (CRITICAL TO EXCLUDE)
    =====================================
    Definition: Acute, fluctuating confusion with inattention

    KEY FEATURES DISTINGUISHING FROM DEMENTIA:
    - Onset: Hours to days (NOT months to years)
    - Course: Fluctuating within same day
    - Attention: ALWAYS impaired (key feature)
    - Consciousness: Altered (hyper- or hypoactive)
    - Duration: Usually days to weeks if cause treated

    IMPORTANT: Delirium can COEXIST with dementia
    - Delirium superimposed on dementia is common
    - Must distinguish baseline from acute change

    =====================================
    2. PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
    =====================================

    DEPRESSION/PSEUDODEMENTIA:
    - Cognitive complaints may be prominent
    - Mood symptoms present
    - May improve with treatment
    - IMPORTANT: Depression can BE early ADRD symptom
      (>50% who develop dementia had depression first)
    - Consider both diagnoses

    SCHIZOPHRENIA:
    - Hallucinations (typically auditory, not visual)
    - Delusions
    - Disorganized thinking
    - Earlier onset typically

    BIPOLAR DISORDER:
    - Mood episodes
    - Cognitive changes during episodes
    - May improve between episodes

    =====================================
    3. MEDICAL CONDITIONS (Treatable Causes)
    =====================================

    LABORATORY WORKUP REQUIRED:
    - TSH (hypothyroidism)
    - Vitamin B12 (deficiency)
    - CBC (anemia, infection)
    - Comprehensive metabolic panel
    - Consider: RPR/VDRL (syphilis), HIV

    TREATABLE CONDITIONS:

    - Vitamin B12 deficiency
    - Infections
    - Dehydration/electrolyte imbalance
    - Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
    - Subdural hematoma
    - Brain tumor

    NOTE ON REVERSIBILITY:
    - Only 0.3-0.6% of dementias are truly reversible
    - BUT approximately 9% have treatable comorbid conditions
    - Always evaluate for treatable contributors

    =====================================
    4. MEDICATION-INDUCED
    =====================================

    HIGH-RISK MEDICATIONS:
    - Anticholinergics (confusion, especially in elderly)
    - Benzodiazepines
    - Opioids
    - Sedative-hypnotics
    - Antipsychotics
    - Some anticonvulsants

    COGNITIVE EVALUATION LABORATORY PANEL
    Purpose: Rule out treatable/reversible causes of cognitive impairment

    =====================================
    TIER 1 - STANDARD WORKUP (All patients)
    =====================================

    1. CBC with Differential
       - Rule out: Anemia, infection, hematologic disorder

    2. Complete Metabolic Panel (Chem-20)
       - Includes: Electrolytes, glucose, renal function, hepatic function
       - Rule out: Metabolic derangement, renal/hepatic encephalopathy

    3. TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)
       - Rule out: Hypothyroidism (can cause reversible cognitive impairment)

    4. Vitamin B12
       - Rule out: B12 deficiency (can cause dementia, neuropathy)
       - Consider homocysteine if B12 borderline

    5. Homocysteine
       - Elevated in B12/folate deficiency
       - Also vascular risk factor

    6. CRP and ESR (Inflammatory Markers)
       - Rule out: Inflammatory conditions, infection

    =====================================
    IMAGING (Essential)
    =====================================

    Brain MRI (Preferred) or CT
    - Rule out: Stroke, tumor, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma
    - Assess: Atrophy pattern, white matter disease, vascular changes
    - MRI superior for detecting:
      - White matter hyperintensities
      - Hippocampal atrophy
      - Microbleeds
      - Small vessel disease

    =====================================
    ADDITIONAL TESTING (As indicated)
    =====================================

    - RPR/VDRL: If syphilis risk or unexplained dementia
    - HIV: If risk factors present
    - Heavy metals: If exposure history
    - LP (Lumbar Puncture): If infection, inflammation, or biomarkers needed
    - EEG: If seizures suspected

    =====================================
    NOTE ON REVERSIBILITY
    =====================================

    - Only 0.3-0.6% of dementias are truly reversible
    - BUT approximately 9% have treatable COMORBID conditions
    - Always evaluate for treatable contributors
    - Even if dementia not reversible, treating comorbidities improves function

    Validation: 90% sensitivity, 87% specificity for MCI
    Domains Assessed: Multiple (attention, memory, language, visuospatial, executive)
    Strengths: More sensitive than MMSE for MCI, executive dysfunction
    Time: ~10 minutes

    =====================================
    MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination)
    =====================================
    Range: 0-30
    Screening Threshold: <26 suggests possible cognitive impairment
    Validation: 81% sensitivity, 82% specificity
    Domains Assessed: Orientation, registration, attention, recall, language, construction
    LIMITATION: Low sensitivity for MCI - may miss mild impairment
    Use: Better for tracking progression than initial screening
    Time: ~10 minutes

    =====================================
    Mini-Cog
    =====================================
    Range: 0-5
    Screening Threshold: <=3 suggests possible cognitive impairment
    Validation: 76% sensitivity, 89% specificity
    Components: 3-word recall + clock drawing
    Strengths: Very brief, good for primary care
    Limitation: Limited domain assessment
    Time: ~3 minutes

    =====================================
    CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating)
    =====================================
    Range: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3
    NOT a screening tool - STAGING tool for severity

    0 = No impairment
    0.5 = MCI/Questionable (functional independence PRESERVED)
    1 = Mild dementia (functional impairment PRESENT)
    2 = Moderate dementia
    3 = Severe dementia

    CRITICAL: CDR 0.5 vs 1 distinguishes MCI from dementia
    Based on functional impairment, not just cognitive scores

    Domains Assessed: Memory, orientation, judgment, community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care

    FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT: THE KEY TO MCI vs DEMENTIA DISTINCTION

    CRITICAL CONCEPT:
    Functional impairment is THE distinguishing feature between MCI and dementia.
    Cognitive test scores alone do NOT differentiate MCI from dementia.

    =====================================
    MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)
    =====================================
    - Functional independence PRESERVED
    - May be slower, less efficient, make more errors
    - BUT maintains independence without assistance
    - Can still manage IADLs and ADLs

    =====================================
    DEMENTIA
    =====================================
    - Functional independence IMPAIRED
    - Requires assistance with activities
    - Cannot function independently in usual activities
    - Progressive loss of independence

    =====================================
    FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT TOOLS
    =====================================

    LAWTON IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living)
    Range: 0-8 (8 = fully independent)
    Activities: Phone, shopping, food prep, housekeeping, laundry, transport, medications, finances

    CRITICAL FOR MCI vs DEMENTIA:
    - MCI: Score 7-8 (preserved or minimal difficulty)
    - Dementia: Score <7 (impaired)

    IADLs decline BEFORE basic ADLs in neurodegenerative disease.

    KATZ ADL (Basic Activities of Daily Living)
    Range: 0-6 (6 = fully independent)
    Activities: Bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, feeding

    Basic ADL impairment indicates more advanced disease:
    - MCI: ADLs fully preserved (score 6)
    - Mild dementia: ADLs preserved or minimal difficulty
    - Moderate/severe dementia: ADL impairment present

    =====================================
    FAQ (Functional Activities Questionnaire)
    =====================================
    Informant-rated assessment of functional abilities
    Useful for detecting subtle IADL decline

    =====================================
    CLINICAL APPLICATION
    =====================================

    When evaluating a patient with cognitive complaints:

    1. Document SPECIFIC functional abilities/limitations
    2. Get informant input (patient may lack insight)
    3. Ask about CHANGE from previous level
    4. Assess IADLs first (most sensitive to early decline)

    If cognitive impairment present:
    - IADLs preserved → MCI
    - IADLs impaired → Dementia
