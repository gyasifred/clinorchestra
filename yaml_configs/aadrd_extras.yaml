PLUS >=2 of 5 domains affected: Memory (repetitive questions, misplacing items, forgetting events), Executive (poor judgment, cannot manage finances), Visuospatial (cannot recognize faces/objects), Language (word-finding difficulty), Behavior (mood changes, apathy, disinhibition).'

  content: 'FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT - KEY FOR MCI VS DEMENTIA: Lawton IADL (0-8, 8=independent) measures instrumental activities (phone, shopping, food prep, housekeeping, laundry, transport, meds, finances). IADL impairment = dementia (not MCI). IADLs decline BEFORE basic ADLs. Katz ADL (0-6, 6=independent) measures basic self-care (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, feeding). Basic ADL impairment indicates more advanced disease.'
